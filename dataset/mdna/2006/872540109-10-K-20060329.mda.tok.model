item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including those discussed in item a of this report under the section entitled risk factors 
the discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended january  fiscal  january  fiscal and january  fiscal 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal tjx elected to early adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard requires that the fair value of all stock based awards be reflected in the financial statements based on the fair value of the award 
tjx has elected the modified retrospective transition method and accordingly  all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this standard in those periods  based on the pro forma amounts as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements 
results of operations fiscal overview net sales for fiscal were billion  an increase over fiscal consolidated same store sales increased in fiscal over the prior year  with approximately percentage point of this increase coming from the favorable effect of currency exchange rates on our winners and tk maxx businesses 
we increased our number of stores by in fiscal  ending the fiscal year with  stores in operation 
our selling square footage grew by in fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share  last year 
both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results 
the chart below shows the effect of these items on net income and earnings per share 
fiscal fiscal dollars in millions except per share amounts s eps s eps net income as reported adjusted for cumulative lease accounting charge impact of deferred tax liability correction repatriation income tax benefit third quarter events net income as adjusted the third quarter events include the cost of executive resignation agreements  e commerce exit costs and operating losses  and hurricane related costs including the estimated impact of lost sales  partially offset by a gain from a visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement 
we believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis  and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business 
our pre tax margin the ratio of pre tax income to net sales declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline was primarily due to the de levering impact of low single digit same store sales on our expense ratios 
fourth quarter results for fiscal were stronger than earlier quarters  with same store sales that increased and pre tax margins that grew from last year to this year 
approximately one half of the pre tax margin improvement was due to increased gross profit margins and expense leverage during the quarter  with the balance due to the impact on last year s results of a one time charge related to lease accounting 
we believe that changes initiated in the third quarter of fiscal to improve execution of our off price strategies  particularly off price buying  contributed to our strong fourth quarter results 

table of contents we continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which allowed us to fund our stock repurchase program as well as our capital investment needs 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of our shares at a cost of million  which favorably affected our earnings per share 
average per store inventories  including inventory on hand at our distribution centers  were down at the end of fiscal as compared to the prior year end period 
this decline is largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers 
the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level 
this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment

net sales net sales for fiscal totaled billion  an increase over net sales of billion in fiscal net sales for fiscal increased over sales of billion for fiscal our reporting period for fiscal included weeks compared to weeks in both fiscal and fiscal  which added incremental sales of approximately million in fiscal the increase in net sales for fiscal includes a increase attributable to new stores and a increase in same store sales 
the increase in net sales for fiscal over fiscal reflects approximately from new stores  from same store sales growth and from the acquisition of bob s stores  partially offset by approximately a reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal having one less week than fiscal bob s stores was acquired on december  and our sales results for fiscal include bob s stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal and fiscal new stores are a major source of sales growth 
our consolidated store count increased by in fiscal and in fiscal over the respective prior year period 
our selling square footage increased by in fiscal and in fiscal we expect to add stores net of store closings in the fiscal year ending january  fiscal  a projected increase in our consolidated store base  and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 
same store sales for fiscal were driven by strong demand for jewelry  accessories  and footwear  which continued to generate significant increases on top of very strong results last year  as well as improved demand for men s apparel 
the positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and women s sportswear 
marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments 
these stores had same store sales growth which exceeded marmaxx s chain average 
in the united states  where tjx generates approximately of its sales  same store sales were strong in warm weather regions  particularly florida  the southwest and california  while flat to slightly negative in the midwest and northeast 
same store sales growth was positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates  which contributed approximately a percentage point of growth 
net sales for fiscal reflected strong demand for jewelry and accessories  women s apparel and footwear  partially offset by weaker demand for men s apparel and home fashions 
the growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal over the prior year was driven by a same store sales increase at marmaxx  our largest division 
marmaxx ended the year with tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments which were significant factors in marmaxx achieving a same store sales increase in fiscal same store sales growth in fiscal benefited by approximately percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates 
we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years  or in other words  stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation 
we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria 
we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year  unless a store is closed 
we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year on a comparable week basis 
relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we 
table of contents believe the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial 
consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars 
we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions  because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance 
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january weeks net sales cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense  net income before provision for income taxes cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal this ratio for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 
the improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions  partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs 
in addition  the comparison to the fiscal expense ratio was favorably impacted by a million non cash charge million after tax in fiscal to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption lease accounting 
this charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal and increased last year s expense ratio by 
these improvements in the fiscal expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales  primarily occupancy costs  which reflect the de levering impact of a same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx  which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales for fiscal as compared with fiscal reflects consolidated merchandise margins that were essentially flat to the prior year 
throughout fiscal  the marmaxx division effectively executed its merchandising and inventory management strategies  maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need  all of which led to improved merchandise margin at this division 
however  this improved merchandise margin at marmaxx in fiscal was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions  most of which experienced higher markdowns 
the increase in this ratio in fiscal includes a 
increase due to the lease accounting charge 
this ratio in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  also reflects an increase of approximately 
due to the absence of the rd week in fiscal as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal the balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx  which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in fiscal over the prior year is due to an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales  reflecting the de levering impact of the low single digit same store sales increase 
the increase in this ratio was also negatively impacted by the net impact of third quarter events including the cost of the executive resignation agreements  e commerce exit and hurricane related costs  offset in part by the visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement 
the increase in this ratio in fiscal was primarily due to a 
increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of bob s stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results 
bob s stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our off price divisions 
in addition  the fiscal expense ratio compared to fiscal reflects an increase in stock based compensation 
tjx has taken various actions to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal designed to improve profit margins 
tjx also revised its approach to long term compensation in fiscal by substantially decreasing the number 
table of contents of stock options issued and increasing the long term cash incentive award opportunities  which is designed to help control the long term portion of compensation costs going forward 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net interest expense in fiscal is due to higher short term borrowings and interest rates 
the higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases  capital expenditures and repurchase of the company s common stock 
the additional interest expense from short term borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of million of unsecured notes in june  as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates 
the reduction in net interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in interest income in fiscal income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the tax provision for fiscal includes a fourth quarter benefit of million due to the repatriation of earnings from our canadian subsidiary 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans 
we had previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains which are not taxable 
the impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of million  or 
per share in fiscal the cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal was million  all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the million  million related to fiscal these two items collectively reduced the fiscal effective income tax rate by 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in state income tax rates 
net income net income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net income per share was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal net income for fiscal was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of million  or 
per share  due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of million  or 
per share  relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability 
net income for fiscal was adversely impacted by approximately million  or 
per share  due to the third quarter events 
these third quarter events included the after tax cost of executive resignation agreements  primarily with respect to our former ceo million  e commerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses million  and uninsured losses due to hurricanes in the third quarter  including the estimated impact of lost sales million  all of which were partially offset by a gain from a visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement million 
operating losses of the e commerce operation in the first six months of fiscal were largely offset by fiscal start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal net income for fiscal was reduced by million  or 
per share  as a result of the after tax effect of the million cumulative pre tax  non cash charge associated with our lease accounting practices 
in fiscal  we estimate that the rd week added approximately million to net income and 
to our earnings per share 
lastly  favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal and fiscal added approximately 
to our earnings per share in each year 
the change in earnings per share from year to year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program 
during fiscal we repurchased million shares of our stock at a cost of million and in fiscal we repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal with planned purchases of approximately million 

table of contents trends improved in the fourth quarter  with significant increases in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year 
reported net income was million  up over the prior year  and earnings per share was  up over the prior year 
results for both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results 
the chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter net income and earnings per share fourth quarter fourth quarter fiscal fiscal dollars in millions except per share amounts s eps s eps net income as reported adjusted for cumulative lease accounting charge impact of deferred tax liability correction repatriation income tax benefit net income as adjusted excluding these one time items  fourth quarter net income was million  up and earnings per share was  up 
results were driven by same store sales growth of as well as by decreases in cost of sales  including buying and occupancy costs and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 
the reduction in the cost of sales ratio was due to improved merchandise margins  with reduced levels of markdowns at our winners  homegoods and aj wright divisions being the major factors 
the reduction in the selling  general and administrative expense ratio was due to a decrease in store payroll and other store costs as a percentage of net sales 
segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments 
we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment 
we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment profit or loss  which we define as pre tax income before general corporate expense and interest expense  net 
segment profit or loss  as defined by tjx  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
in addition  this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
more detailed information about our segments  including a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to income before provision for income taxes can be found in note n to the consolidated financial statements 
segment profit or loss for fiscal includes each segment s share of the cumulative pre tax charge relating to lease accounting 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption lease accounting 
also  segment profit for the current year and all prior periods include the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
segment profit for fiscal was positively impacted by the strong fourth quarter  in which every division increased its segment profit  or decreased its segment loss  compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
marmaxx fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks net sales segment profit segment profit as of net sales percent increase decrease in same store sales stores in operation at end of period selling square footage at end of period in thousands marmaxx posted a same store sales increase in fiscal  compared to a increase in same store sales for fiscal same store sales growth in fiscal was driven by strong sales in the jewelry  accessories and footwear categories  while same store sales for home fashions and women s sportswear were below the chain average 
same store sales in fiscal also reflected strong sales in the jewelry  accessories and footwear categories as well as women s sportswear 
same store sales in both years benefited from the continuation of the marmaxx program whereby certain 
table of contents departments in the tj maxx and marshalls stores were expanded 
marmaxx ended fiscal with tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal these initiatives were significant factors in marmaxx s overall same store sales results  particularly in fiscal when sales in the stores with the expanded departments were above the chain average 
geographically in fiscal  florida  the southwest and the west coast all performed above the chain average  while the northeast and the midwest performed below the chain average 
segment profit as a percentage of net sales segment margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in the fiscal segment margin was largely driven by the de levering impact of a same store sales increase  which impacted operating expense ratios  primarily occupancy costs which increased 
as a percentage of sales and distribution center costs which increased 
as a percentage of sales 
in addition  the certain third quarter events described earlier e commerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the visa mastercard settlement reduced segment margin in fiscal by 
the comparison to the fiscal margin is favorably impacted by the inclusion in last year s segment profit of a million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment  which reduced fiscal segment profit margin by 
merchandise margin for fiscal was essentially flat compared to fiscal despite fuel related increases in freight costs 
as of january   average inventories per store were down compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand at the distribution centers 
segment margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal despite the impact of the lease accounting charge described above 
in fiscal  marmaxx executed its merchandising and inventory strategies effectively  which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins which increased 
marmaxx also effectively managed expenses in fiscal these improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of 
as a percentage of sales  
of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge 
segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal are also impacted by the benefit of the rd week in the fiscal reporting period 
the rd week in fiscal had an estimated favorable impact of 
on the segment profit margin for that year  as the sales volume from this extra week helped to lever certain fixed costs 
we added a net of new stores tj maxx or marshalls in fiscal and increased total selling square footage of the division by 
we expect to open new stores net of closings in fiscal  increasing the marmaxx store base by and increasing its selling square footage by

same store sales were also impacted by lower clearance sales volume  primarily in the second half of the year  as winners per store inventories were significantly below the prior year due to improved inventory management 
at the end of fiscal  average per store inventories were down compared to the prior year 
same store sales were also negatively impacted by declines in the women s sportswear and home fashion categories 
segment profit margin improved by 
compared to fiscal this improvement was primarily due to a increase in merchandise margins which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns 
the increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the de levering impact of the decline in same store sales 
expense ratios increased across most categories  with a increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant 
incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal also impacted segment profit 
the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal to fiscal is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal segment profit of a million charge for this division s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
the growth in winners segment profit in fiscal over fiscal was due to favorable currency exchange rates 
the segment profit margin for fiscal of was below fiscal  primarily due to lower merchandise margins  which decreased 
from the prior year  primarily driven by markdowns 
sales in the second half of fiscal slowed considerably from the first half  due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment 
this  combined with winners aggressive buying based on the strength of its first half sales  resulted in excess inventories  requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year  negatively impacting segment profit margin 
the lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by 
in fiscal the change in segment profit margin for both fiscal and fiscal was negatively impacted by the growth of the company s homesense business  which is at an earlier stage of development than the core winners business and therefore operates with higher expense ratios 
we added a net of winners stores and homesense stores in fiscal  and expanded selling square footage in canada by 
we expect to add a net of winners and homesense stores in fiscal  increasing our total canadian store base by  and increasing selling square footage by 
the store counts include the winners portion and homesense portion of this division s superstores which either combine a winners store with a homesense store or operates them side by side

tk maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal  primarily due to lower markdowns 
in addition  the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal to fiscal is favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal segment profit of this division s share of the 
table of contents cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of million 
these improvements however  were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent  utilities and property taxes as well as the de levering impact of a same store sales increase 
distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal  despite the low same store sales increase 
tk maxx s operating results for fiscal were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year 
in light of the retail environment under which tk maxx operated in fiscal  this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins 
segment profit and segment margin for fiscal include a million charge for tk maxx s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
the significant growth in tk maxx s segment profit in fiscal is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates 
the segment profit margin in fiscal decreased

segment profit increased to million from million and segment profit margin increased to of sales from of sales in the prior year 
the increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs  as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of million 
homegoods fourth quarter same store sales and operating results were particularly strong 
the strength of homegoods fourth quarter more than offset unfavorable factors to segment profit and margin for fiscal  including the de levering impact of the same store sales increase  e commerce operating loss of million and approximately million of costs related to the planned closing of a distribution center 
segment profit in fiscal declined to million from million in the prior year 
the business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix  which led to a same store sales increase 
the business also took additional markdowns  which led to a reduction in its merchandise margin 
the decline in segment profit margin from in fiscal to in fiscal is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin 
segment profit in fiscal also included a charge for million for homegoods share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 
segment profit margin was also impacted by increases in occupancy costs and distribution center costs as a percentage of net sales 
these expense ratio increases reflect the de levering impact on expense ratios of a same store sales increase 
we opened a net of homegoods stores in fiscal  a increase  and increased selling square footage of the division by

in fiscal  effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories  primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits 
we reduced the number of our new store openings for aj wright in fiscal as we believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal may have been too aggressive for this young division  placing a strain on operations 
aj wright s segment loss grew to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we believe that the aj wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors  such as higher energy costs  and that such factors along with a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales in fiscal these sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix 
segment profit margin for fiscal reflected a reduction in merchandise margins of  primarily due to this higher markdown activity 
in addition  the lower than planned sales volume for fiscal negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs  distribution center costs and store payroll 
distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to aj wright s new distribution facility in indiana

bob s stores operated stores as of the end of fiscal net sales for fiscal were less than the prior year  primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars 
although merchandise margin improved in fiscal due to lower promotional markdowns  the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal as compared to fiscal segment loss in fiscal also includes severance costs of million in connection with a reduction in the work force at bob s stores 
for fiscal  we plan to open bob s store 
we are in the process of implementing new strategies for bob s with the goal of reducing its segment loss in fiscal 
table of contents general corporate expense fiscal year ended january dollars in millions weeks general corporate expense general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments 
this item includes the costs of the corporate office  including the compensation and benefits including stock based compensation for senior corporate management  payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting  internal audit  treasury  investor relations  tax  risk management  legal  human resources and systems  and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff 
in addition  general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and non operating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions 
general corporate expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal over fiscal is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements million and of exiting the e commerce business of million 
both of these items occurred in our third quarter period ended october  in addition  general corporate expense includes a charge million in connection with an idle leased facility 
the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses  the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity 
in addition  general corporate expense for fiscal reflects an increase in general corporate overhead  incremental audit fees and costs related to the start up of our e commerce businesses 
this increase was offset in part by a million reduction in contributions to the tjx foundation in fiscal  compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  million in fiscal   million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 
net income adjusted for non cash items was essentially the same in each year 
the difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year was largely driven by the change in inventory  net of accounts payable  from prior year end levels 
in fiscal this change in net inventory position resulted in a source of cash of million compared to a use of cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal this trend is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period 
average per store inventories at january   including inventory on hand at our distribution centers  decreased compared to the prior year and at january  they increased compared to the prior year 
this compares to inventories per store at january  that were up compared to the prior year 
effective with the third quarter ended october   we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by tjx 
this accrual increased inventory by million as of january  and by million as of january  along with a comparable increase to our accounts payable  and thus had no impact on cash flows from operations 
the cash flows from operating activities for both fiscal and fiscal were also impacted by increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities in each year 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased in each year in part due to higher liabilities for rent  gift cards and payroll and benefits 
in addition  fiscal was impacted by an increase in deferred landlord allowances 
cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal all of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal  and were made on a voluntary basis 
discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former tjx businesses 
the reserve reflects tjx s estimation of its cost for claims  updated quarterly  that have been  or are likely to be  made against tjx for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of 
table of contents the leases of these businesses  after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations 
at january   substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved 
although tjx s actual costs with respect to any of these leases may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve  and tjx may incur costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or had not expired  tjx does not expect to incur any material costs related to discontinued operations in excess of the reserve 
the reserve balance amounted to million as of january   million as of january  and million as of january  during fiscal  tjx received creditor recoveries of million  offset by equivalent additions to the reserve to reflect adjustments to the reserve during the year 
any additional creditor recoveries are expected to be immaterial 
we may also be contingently liable on up to leases of bj s wholesale club  another former tjx business  for which bj s wholesale club is primarily liable 
our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases  because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj s wholesale club 
off balance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases  for which we were a lessee or guarantor  which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords 
over many years  we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties 
with the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above  we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases  and accordingly  we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them 
we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate 
we estimate the undiscounted obligations  not reflected in our reserves  of leases of closed stores of continuing operations  bj s wholesale club leases discussed above  and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet  if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations  is approximately million as of january  we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and  to the extent they do  will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 
we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold  specified environmental matters or certain income taxes 
these obligations are typically limited in time and amount 
there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 
investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below fiscal year ended january in millions new stores store renovations and improvements office and distribution centers capital expenditures we expect that capital expenditures will approximate million for fiscal this includes million for new stores  million for store renovations  expansions and improvements and million for our office and distribution centers 
the planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer new store openings  primarily at homegoods  aj wright and aj maxx  as well as lower capital spending across most other areas of our business

we repurchased million shares in fiscal  million shares in fiscal  and million shares in fiscal all shares repurchased were retired 
during fiscal  we completed a billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional billion of common stock 
under the new billion stock repurchase program  we repurchased million shares at a total cost of million through january  in january  winners entered into a c million us non revolving term credit facility  due in january and guaranteed by tjx 
interest is payable at rates equal to  or less than the canadian prime rate 
winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively establishes a fixed rate of approximately on this debt 
the proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of winners earnings to tjx as well as other general corporate purposes of this division

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations  short term bank borrowings and the issuance of short term commercial paper 
in may  we entered into a million four year revolving credit facility and a million five year revolving credit facility 
these arrangements replaced our million five year revolving credit facility entered into in march and our million day revolving credit facility  which had been extended through july  the new agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings 
these agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program 
as of january  there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities 
the maximum amount of our us short term borrowings outstanding was million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal the weighted average interest rate on our us short term borrowings was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal as of january   winners had credit lines totaling c million  c million to meet certain operating needs and c million letter of credit facility 
there were credit lines totaling c million at both january  and january   respectively 
the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit lines was c million in fiscal  c million in fiscal  and c million in fiscal as of january   tk maxx had a million credit line to meet certain operating needs 
the maximum amount outstanding in fiscal was million on this line 
there were no outstanding borrowings on either of these credit lines as of january  we believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs

table of contents contractual obligations as of january   we had payment obligations including current installments under long term debt arrangements  leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands payments due by year less than more than total year years years years long term contractual obligations long term debt obligations including estimated interest operating lease commitments capital lease obligations purchase obligations the long term debt obligations above includes estimated interest costs and assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal the note holders also have a put option available to them in fiscal if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted  the notes will mature in fiscal the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of january  the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance  real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay 
these costs were approximately one third of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january  our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise  purchase orders for capital expenditures  supplies and other operating needs  commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services  and commitments under executive employment agreements 
we excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 
we also have long term liabilities which includes million for employee compensation and benefits  most of which will come due beyond five years  derivative contracts of approximately million  the majority of which comes due in fiscal and million for accrued rent  the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table 
critical accounting policies tjx must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies 
we consider our most critical accounting policies  involving management estimates and judgments  to be those relating to inventory valuation  retirement obligations  casualty insurance  and accounting for taxes 
we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained  had alternative assumptions been selected  would not be materially different from the results we have reported 
inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a first in first out basis 
under the retail method  the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a cost to retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory 
this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage 
a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns 
under the retail method  permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed 
we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods 
in addition  as a normal business practice  we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken  greatly reducing the need for management estimates 
inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods  but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end 
thus  the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
overall  we believe that the retail method  coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end  results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated 
lastly  many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions  which ultimately affect the 
table of contents value of the inventory 
our off price businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors 
bob s stores  the value oriented retailer we acquired in december  does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met 
these arrangements do have some impact on bob s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results 
retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates 
we are required to make assumptions regarding variables  such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the long term rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets  both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period 
the discount rate  which we determine annually based on market interest rates  has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for fiscal and for several years prior to fiscal were considerably less than our expected returns 
these two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan 
we have made contributions of million  which exceeded the minimum required  over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 
casualty insurance tjx s casualty insurance program requires tjx to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost 
the estimated claims are developed  with the assistance of an actuary  based on historical experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates 
if tjx s estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal were to change by  the fiscal pre tax cost would increase or decrease by approximately million 
a large portion of these claims are funded with a non refundable payment during the policy year  offsetting our estimated claims accrual 
the company has a net accrual of million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of january  accounting for taxes like many large corporations  we are regularly under audit by the united states federal  state  local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
the internal revenue service has examined the fiscal years ended january through january and several proposed adjustments are under appeal 
we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r which requires that the cost of all employee stock options  as well as other equity based compensation arrangements  be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
tjx adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal and elected the modified retrospective transition method 
accordingly all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r in amounts equal to the pro forma results presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage by requiring these items to be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
it eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of 
table of contents apb and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
we adopted sfas no 
in the second quarter of fiscal which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle 
the statement requires retrospective application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements rather than recording the cumulative effect of the change in net earnings in the current period 
sfas no 
also strictly defines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fiscal for tjx 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease  collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements 
eitf provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of a the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements useful lives  or b a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase 
eitf is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date of the fasb s ratification  which was on june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
was issued in march this interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event 
this interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
we have determined that conditional legal obligations exist for certain of our leased facilities  primarily our distribution centers 
the asset retirement obligation and the annual cost reflected in these financials is immaterial 
market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations 
as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements  we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations  intercompany transactions with these operations  and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations  with derivative financial instruments 
we utilize currency forward and swap contracts  designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures 
the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes 
we are also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our revolving credit line  which has variable rate of interest 
the impact on our future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings 
in addition  the assets of our qualified pension plan  a large portion of which is invested in equity securities  are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market 
we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations 
as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements  we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations  intercompany transactions with these operations  and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations  with derivative financial instruments 
we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure 
we utilize currency forward and swap contracts  designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures  most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders equity 
the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of january   the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our cash equivalents and short term investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the company 
we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing  however  we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year 
as of january   the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
