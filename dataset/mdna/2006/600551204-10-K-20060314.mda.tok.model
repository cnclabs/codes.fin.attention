part i item business general miller industries  inc is the world s largest manufacturer of vehicle towing and recovery equipment  with executive offices in ooltewah  tennessee and atlanta  georgia  domestic manufacturing operations in tennessee and pennsylvania  and foreign manufacturing operations in france and the united kingdom 
since  we have developed or acquired several of the most well recognized brands in the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry 
our strategy has been to diversify our line of products and increase our presence in the industry by combining internal growth and development with acquisitions of complementary businesses 
towing and recovery equipment we offer a broad range of towing and recovery equipment products that meet most customer design  capacity and cost requirements 
we manufacture the bodies of wreckers and car carriers  which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties 
we frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers 
wreckers generally are used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with rotating hydraulic booms and ton lifting capacities 
car carriers are specialized flat bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport 
car carriers transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective over longer distances 
our products primarily are sold through independent distributors that serve all states  canada and mexico  and other foreign markets including europe  the pacific rim and the middle east 
additionally  as a result of our ownership of jige in france and boniface in the united kingdom  we have substantial distribution capabilities in europe 
while most of our distributor agreements do not contain exclusivity provisions  management believes that approximately of our independent distributors sell our products on an exclusive basis 
in addition to selling our products to towing operators  our independent distributors provide parts and service 
we also utilize sales representatives to exclusively market our products and provide expertise and sales assistance to our independent distributors 
management believes the strength of our distribution network and the breadth of our product offerings are two key advantages over our competitors 
product lines we manufacture a broad line of wrecker  car carrier and trailer bodies to meet a full range of customer design  capacity and cost requirements 
wreckers 
wreckers are generally used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with ton lifting capacities 
wreckers are available with specialized features  including underlifts  l arms and scoops  which lift disabled vehicles by the tires or front axle to minimize front end damage to the towed vehicles 
certain heavy duty wrecker models offer rotating booms  which allow heavy duty wreckers to recover vehicles from any angle  and proprietary remote control devices for operating wreckers 
in addition  certain light duty wreckers are equipped with the express automatic wheellift hookup device that allow operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the wrecker 
our wreckers range in capacity from to tons  and are characterized as light duty and heavy duty  with wreckers of ton or greater capacity being classified as heavy duty 
light duty wreckers are used to remove vehicles from accident scenes and vehicles illegally parked  abandoned or disabled  and for general recovery 
heavy duty wreckers are used in commercial towing and recovery applications including overturned tractor trailers  buses  motor homes and other vehicles 
car carriers 
car carriers are specialized flat bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport 
car carriers are used to transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective for transporting vehicles or other equipment over longer distances 
in addition to transporting vehicles  car carriers may also be used for other purposes  including transportation of industrial equipment 
in recent years  professional towing operators have added car carriers to their fleets to complement their towing capabilities 
transport trailers 
our multi vehicle transport trailers are specialized auto transport trailers with upper and lower decks and hydraulic ramps for loading vehicles 
these trailers are used for moving multiple vehicles for auto auctions  car dealerships  leasing companies  and other similar applications 
these trailers are easy to load with to vehicles  and with the optional cab rack  can haul up to vehicles 
the vehicles can be secured to transport quickly with ratchet and chain tie downs that are mounted throughout the frame of the transport 
in recent years  professional towing operators have added auto transport trailers to their fleets to add to their towing capabilities 
also  we have begun to design  engineer and manufacture special use transport and trailer products to be used primarily in military applications 
brand names we manufacture and market our wreckers  car carriers and trailers under ten separate brand names 
although certain brands overlap in terms of features  prices and distributors  each brand has its own distinctive image and customer base 
century 
the century brand is our top of the line brand and represents what management believes to be the broadest product line in the industry 
the century line was started in and produces wreckers ranging from ton light duty to ton heavy duty models  and car carriers in lengths from to feet 
management believes that the century brand has a reputation as the industry s leading product innovator 
vulcan 
our vulcan product line includes a range of premium light and heavy duty wreckers  car carriers and other towing and recovery equipment 
the vulcan line is sold through its own independent distribution network 
challenger 
our challenger products compete with the century and vulcan products and constitute a third premium product line 
challenger products consist of light to heavy duty wreckers with capacities ranging from to tons  and car carriers with lengths ranging from to feet 
the challenger line was started in and is known for high performance heavy duty wreckers and aesthetic design 
holmes 
our holmes product line includes mid priced wreckers with to ton capacities and car carriers in to foot lengths 
the holmes wrecker was first produced in historically  the holmes name has been the most well recognized and leading industry brand both domestically and internationally 
champion 
the champion brand  which was introduced in  includes car carriers which range in length from to feet 
the champion product line  which is generally lower priced  allows us to offer a full line of car carriers at various competitive price points 
in  the champion line was expanded to include a line of economy tow trucks with integrated boom and underlift 
chevron 
our chevron product line is comprised primarily of premium car carriers 
chevron produces a range of premium single car  multi car and industrial carriers  light duty wreckers and other towing and recovery equipment 
the chevron line is operated autonomously with its own independent distribution network 
eagle 
our eagle products consist of light duty wreckers with the eagle claw hook up system that allows towing operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the tow truck 
the eagle claw hook up system  which was patented in  was originally developed for the repossession market 
since acquiring eagle  we have upgraded the quality and features of the eagle product line and expanded its recovery capability 
titan 
our titan product line is comprised of premium multi vehicle transport trailers which can transport up to vehicles depending on configuration 
jige 
our jige product line is comprised of a broad line of light and heavy duty wreckers and car carriers marketed primarily in europe 
jige is a market leader best known for its innovative designs of car carriers and light wreckers necessary to operate within the narrow confines of european cities  as well as large wreckers 
boniface 
our boniface product line is comprised primarily of heavy duty wreckers marketed primarily in europe 
boniface produces a wide range of heavy duty wreckers specializing in the long underlift technology required to tow modern european tour buses 
product development and manufacturing our holmes and century brand names are associated with four of the major innovations in the industry the rapid reverse winch  the tow sling  the hydraulic lifting mechanism  and the underlift with parallel linkage and l arms 
our engineering staff  in consultation with manufacturing personnel  uses computer aided design and stress analysis systems to test new product designs and to integrate various product improvements 
in addition to offering product innovations  we focus on developing or licensing new technology for our products 
we manufacture wreckers  car carriers and trailers at six manufacturing facilities located in the united states  france and the united kingdom 
the manufacturing process for our products consists primarily of cutting and bending sheet steel or aluminum into parts that are welded together to form the wrecker  car carrier body or trailer 
components such as hydraulic cylinders  winches  valves and pumps  which are purchased by us from third party suppliers  are then attached to the frame to form the completed wrecker or car carrier body 
the completed body is either installed by us or shipped by common carrier to a distributor where it is then installed on a truck chassis 
generally  the wrecker or car carrier bodies are painted by us with a primer coat only  so that towing operators can select customized colors to coordinate with chassis colors or fleet colors 
to the extent final painting is required before delivery  we contract with independent paint shops for such services 
we purchase raw materials and component parts from a number of sources 
although we have no long term supply contracts  management believes we have good relationships with our primary suppliers 
we have experienced no significant problems in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts to meet the requirements of our production schedules 
management believes that the materials used in the production of our products are available at competitive prices from an adequate number of alternative suppliers 
accordingly  management does not believe that the loss of a single supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales  distribution and marketing of towing and recovery equipment independent distributors and sales management categorizes the towing and recovery market into three general product types light duty wreckers  heavy duty wreckers  and car carriers 
the light duty wrecker market consists primarily of professional wrecker operators  repossession towing services  municipal and federal governmental agencies  and repair shop or salvage company owners 
the heavy duty market includes professional wrecker operators serving the needs of commercial vehicle operators 
the car carrier market  historically dominated by automobile salvage companies  has expanded to include equipment rental companies that offer delivery service and professional towing operators who desire to complement their existing towing capabilities 
management estimates that there are approximately  professional towing operators and  service station  repair shop and salvage operators comprising the overall towing and recovery market 
our sales force  which services our network of independent distributors  consists of sales representatives whose responsibilities include providing administrative and sales support to the entire base of independent distributors 
sales representatives receive commissions on direct sales based on product type and brand and generally are assigned specific territories in which to promote sales of our products and to maintain customer relationships 
we have developed a diverse network of independent distributors  consisting of approximately distributors in north america  who serve all states  canada and mexico  and approximately distributors that serve other foreign markets 
in  no single distributor accounted for more than of our sales 
management believes our broad and diverse network of distributors provides us with the flexibility to adapt to market changes  lessens our dependence on particular distributors and reduces the impact of regional economic factors 
to support sales and marketing efforts  we produce demonstrator models that are used by our sales representatives and independent distributors 
to increase exposure to our products  we also have served as the official recovery team for many automobile racing events  including daytona  talladega  richmond  chicago  kansas  california  michigan and darlington nascar races  rolex daytona hour race  the brickyard  and the indy races  among others 
we routinely respond to requests for proposals or bid invitations in consultation with our local distributors 
our products have been selected by the united states general services administration as an approved source for certain federal and defense agencies 
we intend to continue to pursue government contracting opportunities 
the towing and recovery equipment industry places heavy marketing emphasis on product exhibitions at national and regional trade shows 
in order to focus our marketing efforts and to control marketing costs  we have reduced our participation in regional trade shows and now concentrate our efforts on five of the major trade shows each year 
we work with our network of independent distributors to concentrate on various regional shows 
disposition of company owned distributors during  our board of directors and management made the decision to sell our distribution group  and by the end of  we had sold all of our towing and recovery distributor locations 
all assets  liabilities and results of operations of the distribution group are now presented separately as discontinued operations and all prior period financial information is presented to conform to this treatment 
product warranties and insurance we offer a month limited manufacturer s product and service warranty on our wrecker and car carrier products 
our warranty generally provides for repair or replacement of failed parts or components 
warranty service is usually performed by us or an authorized distributor 
management believes that we maintain adequate general liability and product liability insurance 
backlog we produce virtually all of our products to order 
our backlog is based upon customer purchase orders that we believe are firm 
the level of backlog at any particular time  however  is not an appropriate indicator of our future operating performance 
certain purchase orders are subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification 
given our production and delivery schedules management believes that the current average backlog represents less than three months of production 
competition the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive for sales to distributors and towing operators 
management believes that competition in this industry focuses on product quality and innovation  reputation  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
we compete on the basis of each of these criteria  with an emphasis on product quality and innovation and customer service 
management also believes that a manufacturer s relationship with distributors is a key component of success in the industry 
accordingly  we have invested substantial resources and management time in building and maintaining strong relationships with distributors 
management also believes that our products are regarded as high quality within their particular price points 
our marketing strategy is to continue to compete primarily on the basis of quality and reputation rather than solely on the basis of price  and to continue to target the growing group of professional towing operators who as end users recognize the quality of our products 
traditionally  the capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low 
management believes a manufacturer s capital resources and access to technological improvements have become a more integral component of success in recent years 
certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than we do 
towing services roadone in february  we formed roadone  inc to build a national towing services network 
however  in october  we made the decision to sell our towing services operations 
as of december   all of the towing services operations had either been sold or closed  and as of december  there were only miscellaneous assets remaining from previous towing services market sales 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we began reporting the entire towing services segment as discontinued operations as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of the results of operations and loss on disposal associated with certain towing service operations which were sold in june have been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations given our significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposal components via a consulting agreement and our ongoing interest in the cash flows of the operations of the disposal components via a long term license agreement 
accordingly  the depreciation of fixed assets ceased on october  as of such date  all assets  liabilities  and results of operations are separately presented as discontinued operations and all prior period financial information is presented to conform with this treatment 
in october  roadone  inc filed for liquidation under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws in the bankruptcy court of the eastern district of tennessee and a trustee was appointed 
although miller industries  inc is the largest creditor of roadone  inc  the filing is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of miller industries 
at this time  our management is not able to predict whether or not any liabilities of discontinued operations currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements of miller industries will be eliminated as a result of this case 
employees we employed approximately people as of december  none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement  though our employees in france and the united kingdom have certain similar rights provided by their respective government s employment regulations 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
intellectual property rights our development of the underlift parallel linkage and l arms in is considered one of the most innovative developments in the wrecker industry in the last years 
this technology is significant primarily because it allows the damage free towing of newer aerodynamic vehicles made of lighter weight materials 
patents for this technology were granted to one of our operating subsidiaries  some of which have expired  and the remainder of which expire over the next few years 
this technology  particularly the l arms  is used in a majority of the commercial wreckers today 
management believes that  until these patents expire  utilization of such devices without a license is an infringement of such patents 
we have successfully litigated infringement lawsuits in which the validity of our patents on this technology was upheld  and successfully settled other lawsuits 
we also hold a number of other utility and design patents covering other products  the vulcan scoop wheel retainer and the car carrier anti tilt device 
we have also obtained the rights to use and develop certain technologies owned or patented by others 
pursuant to the terms of a consent judgment entered into in with the antitrust division of the us department of justice  we are required to offer non exclusive royalty bearing licenses to certain of our key patents to all tow truck and car carrier manufacturers 
our trademarks century  holmes  champion  challenger  formula i  eagle claw self loading wheellift  pro star  street runner  vulcan  right approach and extreme angle  among others  are registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
management believes that our trademarks are well recognized by dealers  distributors and end users in their respective markets and are associated with a high level of quality and value 
government regulations and environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal  state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
the costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past and is not expected to have a material adverse impact in the future 
we are also subject to the magnuson moss warranty federal trade commission improvement act which regulates the description of warranties on products 
the description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of vehicle components 
management believes that continued compliance with various government regulations will not materially affect our operations

item a 
risk factors there are many factors that affect our business and the results of our operations  some of which are beyond our control 
the following is a description of some of the important factors that may cause the actual results of our operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired 
we encourage you to read this section carefully 
our business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry  general economic conditions and weather 
adverse changes with respect to any of these factors may lead to a downturn in our business 
the towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature and has been affected historically by high interest rates  fuel costs  insurance costs  and economic conditions in general 
accordingly  a downturn in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our operations  as was the case during the recent general economic downturn 
the industry also is influenced by consumer confidence and general credit availability  and by weather conditions  none of which is within our control 
our dependence upon outside suppliers for our raw materials  including aluminum and steel  and other purchased component parts  leaves us subject to price increases and delays in receiving supplies of such materials or parts 
we are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs and other purchased component parts  and although we believe that these suppliers will continue to meet our requirements and specifications  and that alternative sources of supply are available  events beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the cost or availability of raw materials and component parts 
shipment delays  unexpected price increases or changes in payment terms from our suppliers of raw materials or component parts could impact our ability to secure necessary raw materials or component parts  or to secure such materials and parts at favorable prices 
for example  recent increases in demand for aluminum and steel  as well as disruptions in the supply of raw materials  has resulted in substantially higher prices for aluminum  steel and related raw materials 
partially to offset these increases  we have  from time to time  implemented general price increases and cost surcharges 
while we have attempted to pass these increased costs on to our customers  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so 
additionally  demand for our products could be negatively affected by the unavailability of truck chassis  which are manufactured by third parties and are frequently supplied by us  or are purchased separately by our distributors or by towing operators 
although we believe that sources of our raw materials and component parts will continue to be adequate to meet our requirements and that alternative sources are available  shortages  price increases or delays in shipments of our raw materials and component parts could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance  competitive position and reputation 
our competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers  or attract current customers away from us 
the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
competition for sales exists at both the distributor and towing operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation  reputation  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
in addition  sales of our products are affected by the market for used towing and recovery equipment 
certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us 
our future success depends upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technology 
historically  we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition 
certain of our patents have expired  and others will expire in the next few years  and as a result  we may not have a continuing competitive advantage through proprietary products and technology 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of a consent judgment entered into in with the antitrust division of the us department of justice  we are required to offer non exclusive royalty bearing licenses to certain of our key patents to all wrecker and car carrier manufacturers 
our historical market position has been a result  in part  of our continuous efforts to develop new products 
our future success and ability to maintain market share will depend  to an extent  on new product development 
continued increases in our customers fuel costs  and the reduced availability of credit for our customers  will have a material effect upon our business 
in recent years  our customers have experienced substantial increases in fuel and other transportation costs 
there can be no assurance that fuel and transportation costs will not continue to increase for our customers in the future 
additionally  our customers have  from time to time  experienced reduced availability of credit  which negatively affects their ability to  and capacity for  purchasing equipment 
these increases in fuel and transportation costs  and these reductions in the availability of credit  have had  and may continue to have  a negative effect on our customers  and a material effect upon our business and operating results 
our international operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results  including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuation 
a significant portion of our net sales and production in were outside the united states  primarily in europe 
as a result  our operations are subject to various political  economic and other uncertainties  including risks of restrictive taxation policies  changing political conditions and governmental regulations 
also  a substantial portion of our net sales derived outside the united states  as well as salaries of employees located outside the united states and certain other expenses  are denominated in foreign currencies  including british pounds and the euro 
we are subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the us dollar 
the proposed expansion of our ooltewah  tennessee and hermitage  pennsylvania manufacturing facilities could adversely affect production at those facilities 
we recently determined to expand our existing manufacturing facilities in ooltewah  tennessee and hermitage  pennsylvania as a result of the recent increases in demand for our products 
although we have implemented a plan to minimize the impact of these expansion activities on our current production  construction delays and related problems could arise as a result of our expansion efforts 
construction or other related problems at these facilities could result in manufacturing delays  and could otherwise adversely affect our ability to operate these facilities at full manufacturing capacity 
the need to service our indebtedness may affect the growth and profitability of our business 
as of january  our debt included approximately million under our new senior credit facility and million under our junior credit facility 
although these debt levels reflect a significant decrease over prior periods  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations has been and will continue to be dedicated to service our debt 
using cash in this manner may affect our ability to grow our business and to take advantage of opportunities for growth 
in addition  this substantial indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
the requirements and restrictions imposed by our credit facilities restrict our ability to operate our business  and failure to comply with these requirements and restrictions could adversely affect our business 
the terms of our new senior credit facility and our amended junior credit facility restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  incur liens  or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or their assets 
our credit facilities also require us to meet certain financial tests  and to comply with certain other reporting  affirmative and negative covenants 
if we fail to comply with the requirements of either of our credit facilities  such non compliance would result in an event of default 
if not waived by the lending groups  such event of default would result in the acceleration of the amounts due under the respective credit facility  and may permit our lenders to foreclose on our assets that secure the credit facilities 
our ability to service our credit facilities may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
because of the amount of obligations outstanding under our credit facilities and the connection of the interest rate under each facility including the default rates to the libor rate  an increase in the libor rate could have a significant effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations under the credit facilities and increase our interest expense significantly 
therefore  our liquidity and access to capital resources could be further affected by increasing interest rates 
we depend upon skilled labor to manufacture our products 
if we experience problems hiring and retaining skilled labor  our business may be negatively affected 
the timely manufacture and delivery of our products requires an adequate supply of skilled labor  and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions 
accordingly  our ability to increase sales  productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities 
in addition  in connection with a representation petition filed by the united auto workers union with the national labor relations board  a vote was held on union representation for employees at our ooltewah  tennessee manufacturing plant in these employees voted against joining the united auto workers union  but the vote was subsequently overturned by the national labor relations board 
thereafter  a new vote was scheduled for february  but this vote was cancelled at the request of the united auto workers union 
while our employees are not currently members of a union  there can be no assurance that the employees at our ooltewah manufacturing plant  or any other of our employees  may not choose to become unionized in the future 
if our common stock was delisted from the new york stock exchange the market for our common stock may be substantially less active and it may impair the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell our common stock 
in june  we received notification from the new york stock exchange that we were not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards because we did not have sufficient shareholders equity or an adequate day average market capitalization 
in response  we implemented a plan for regaining compliance with the continued listing standards 
in december  the nyse notified us that  as a result of our compliance plan  we had regained compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards and had been approved as a company in good standing with the nyse 
as a condition to the nyse s approval  we were subject to a month follow up period with the nyse to ensure continued compliance with the continued listing standards  and continue to be subject to the nyse s routine monitoring procedures 
if we are unable to comply with the nyse s continued listing standards  our common stock could be delisted from the new york stock exchange 
if our common stock is delisted  it is likely that the trading market for our common stock would be substantially less active  and the ability of our shareholders to buy and sell shares of our common stock would be materially impaired 
in addition  the delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to enter into future equity financing transactions 
we are subject to certain retained liabilities related to the wind down of our towing services operations 
we sold or closed all remaining towing services businesses during as a result  almost all of our former towing services businesses now operate under new ownership  and in general the customary operating liabilities of these businesses were assumed by the new owners 
our subsidiaries that sold these businesses are subject to some continuing liabilities with respect to their pre sale operations  including  for example  liabilities related to litigation  certain trade payables  workers compensation and other insurance  surety bonds  and real estate  and miller industries is subject to some of such continuing liabilities by virtue of certain direct parent guarantees 
in october  our subsidiary  roadone  inc  filed for liquidation under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws in the bankruptcy court of the eastern district of tennessee and a trustee was appointed 
at this time  management is not able to predict whether or not any liabilities of discontinued operations currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will be eliminated 
any loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team 
the loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage  or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
we are subject to various claims  including product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business  and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience 
a successful product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or the inability of us to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates  could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market 
from time to time  there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common stock 
our quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimated by analysts  changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance

executive overview miller industries  inc is the world s largest manufacturer of vehicle towing and recovery equipment  with domestic manufacturing subsidiaries in tennessee and pennsylvania  and foreign manufacturing subsidiaries in france and the united kingdom 
we offer a broad range of equipment to meet our customers design  capacity and cost requirements under our century  vulcan  challenger  holmes  champion  chevron  eagle  titan  jige and boniface brand names 
overall  management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor our operating and financial performance 
these indicators include measurements of revenue  operating income  gross margin  income from continuing operations  earnings per share  capital expenditures and cash flow 
we derive revenues primarily from product sales made through our network of domestic and foreign independent distributors 
our revenues are sensitive to a variety of factors  such as demand for  and price of  our products  our technological competitiveness  our reputation for providing quality products and reliable service  competition within our industry  the cost of raw materials including aluminum and steel and general economic conditions 
during  our revenues were positively affected by a general increase in demand for our products resulting from general economic improvements 
in addition  we continued the manufacture of heavy duty towing and recovery units for several military and governmental orders for towing and recovery equipment 
we also began a project with datapath  inc to assist in the design and engineering of mobile communications trailers for military application 
in march  we entered into a new agreement with datapath calling for us to manufacture and sell to them all of their requirements for this type of equipment during the five year term of the agreement 
as a result of these projects  as well as the general increase in demand for our products  we have a strong backlog that we expect to continue into we have been and will continue to be affected by recent large increases in the prices that we pay for raw materials  particularly aluminum  steel and related raw materials 
raw material costs represent a substantial part of our total costs of operations  and management expects aluminum and steel prices to remain at historically high levels for the foreseeable future 
as we determined necessary  we implemented price increases to offset these higher costs 
we also began to develop alternatives to the components used in our production process that incorporate these raw materials 
we have shared several of these alternatives with our major component part suppliers  some of whom have begun to implement them in the production of our component parts 
we continue to monitor raw material prices and availability in order to more favorably position the company in this dynamic market 
in june  we entered into a new million senior credit facility with wachovia bank  national association 
proceeds from this new senior credit facility were used to repay the cit group business credit  inc and william g 
miller  our chairman and co chief executive officer  under our former senior credit facility  and as a result  our former senior credit facility was satisfied and terminated  and mr 
miller no longer holds any of our senior debt 
the interest rates under the new senior credit facility reflect substantial reductions from the rates on our former senior credit facility 
at december   the balance under our new senior credit facility was million  consisting entirely of the term loan portion of this facility 
this lower level of indebtedness represents a significant decrease in our overall indebtedness from prior periods 
in june  we also amended our junior credit facility by adding an additional loan which increased our subordinated debt from million to million 
the maturity date on the junior credit facility was extended to september   and the loans under the facility continue to bear interest at a rate equal to 
mr 
miller  as successor to harbourside investments  lllp an entity that he controlled until its liquidation and distribution in may is now the sole lender under our amended junior credit facility 
compliance with new york stock exchange continued listing standards in june  we received notification from the new york stock exchange that we were not in compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards because we did not have sufficient shareholders equity or an adequate day average market capitalization 
in response  we implemented a plan for regaining compliance with the continued listing standards 
in december  the nyse notified us that  as a result of our compliance plan  we had regained compliance with the nyse s continued listing standards and had been approved as a company in good standing with the nyse 
as a condition to the nyse s approval  we completed a month follow up period with the nyse to ensure continued compliance with the continued listing standards  and we continue to be subject to the nyse s routine monitoring procedures 
discontinued operations during  management and the board of directors made the decision to divest of our towing services segment  as well as the operations of the distribution group of our towing and recovery equipment segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the assets of the towing services segment and the distribution group are considered a disposal group and the assets are no longer being depreciated 
all assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with these assets have been separately presented in the accompanying financial statements 
the statements of operations and related financial statement disclosures for all prior periods have been restated to present the towing services segment and the distribution group as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations 
the analyses contained herein are of continuing operations  as restated  unless otherwise noted 
in general  the customary operating liabilities of these disposed businesses were assumed by the new owners 
our subsidiaries that sold these businesses are nevertheless subject to some continuing liabilities with respect to their pre sale operations  including  for example  liabilities related to litigation  certain trade payables  workers compensation and other insurance  surety bonds  and real estate 
except in the case of direct guarantees  these are not obligations of miller industries  inc and miller industries  inc would expect to take whatever steps it deems appropriate to protect itself from any such liabilities 
in october  roadone  inc filed for liquidation under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws in the bankruptcy court of the eastern district of tennessee and a trustee was appointed 
although miller industries  inc is the largest creditor of roadone  inc  the filing is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
at this time  management is not able to predict whether or not any liabilities of discontinued operations currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will be eliminated 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates 
certain accounting policies are deemed critical  as they require management s highest degree of judgment  estimates and assumptions 
a discussion of critical accounting policies  the judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions follows accounts receivable we extend credit to customers in the normal course of business 
collections from customers are continuously monitored and an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues 
while such bad debt expenses have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
when a determination has been made that the carrying amount of long lived assets and goodwill may not be fully recovered  the amount of impairment is measured by comparing an asset s estimated fair value to its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on projected future cash flows discounted at a rate determined by management  or if available independent appraisals or sales price negotiations 
the estimation of fair value includes significant judgment regarding assumptions of revenue  operating costs  interest rates  property and equipment additions  and industry competition and general economic and business conditions among other factors 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  changes in any of these factors could affect these evaluations 
based on these estimations  we believe that our long lived assets are appropriately valued 
warranty reserves we estimate expense for product warranty claims at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
we review trends of warranty claims and take actions to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
we believe the warranty reserve is adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider tax loss carrybacks  reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning and estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we currently have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets from continuing and discontinued operations 
the allowance reflects our recognition that cumulative losses in recent years indicate that it is unclear whether certain future tax benefits will be realized through future taxable income 
differences between the effective tax rate and the expected tax rate are due primarily to changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the balance of the valuation allowance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
revenues under our accounting policies  sales are recorded when equipment is shipped or risk of ownership is transferred to independent distributors or other customers 
while we manufacture only the bodies of wreckers  which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties  we frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers 
sales of company purchased truck chassis are included in net sales 
margins are substantially lower on completed recovery vehicles containing company purchased chassis because the markup over the cost of the chassis is nominal 
seasonality we have experienced some seasonality in net sales due in part to decisions by purchasers of towing and recovery equipment to defer purchases near the end of the chassis model year 
our net sales have historically been seasonally impacted due in part to weather conditions 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency 
the translation from the applicable foreign currencies to us dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  historical rates for equity and the weighted average exchange rate during the period for revenue and expense accounts 
the gains or losses resulting from such translations are included in shareholders equity 
for intercompany debt denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  the remeasurement into the functional currency is also included in shareholders equity as the amounts are considered to be of a long term investment nature 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  the components of the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales 
continuing operations net sales costs and expenses costs of operations selling  general and administrative special charges interest expense  net total costs and expenses income before income taxes discontinued operations net sales costs and expenses costs of operations selling  general and administrative special charges interest expense  net total costs and expenses loss before income taxes year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales from continuing operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of overall improvements in market conditions  with increases in demand leading to increases in production levels  production and delivery of units under contract with the australian military and production of mobile communication trailers for datapath 
to a lesser extent  this increase is also attributable to price increases that we implemented throughout and costs of operations as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to increases in productivity as demand for our products increased 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   due to the fixed nature of certain of these expenses spread over the higher sales volume 
the effective rate for the provision for income taxes for continuing operations was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate primarily reflects additional taxes on foreign income for the period 
discontinued operations net sales from the distribution group decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  revenues were negatively impacted by the disposal of all distributor locations by the end of the towing services segment had no net sales during the years ended december  and  because all towing services operations were sold during cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the distribution group was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  there were no costs of sales for the towing services segment during the years ended december  and as explained above  we sold all our remaining towing services markets by the end of calendar selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was for the distribution group and for the towing services segment for the year ended december  compared to and  respectively for the year ended december  increases in the percentage of sales for the distribution group were primarily the result of lower administrative expenses spread over a smaller revenue base  as we continued to sell the remaining distribution location 
the effective rate for the provision for income taxes for discontinued operations was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  interest expense our total interest expense for continuing and discontinued operations decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable year ago period 
interest expense was million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations for the year ended december   compared to million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations for the year ended december  decreases in interest expense were due to overall decreases in debt levels  as well as lower interest rates on our new senior credit facility 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  continuing operations net sales from continuing operations were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of overall improvements in market conditions  with increases in demand leading to increases in production levels  and is attributable to a lesser extent to price increases implemented during there were no sales for the towing services segment in compared to million for the comparable prior year as the remaining towing services entities were sold during costs of operations as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling  general  and administrative expenses changed slightly as a percentage of net sales from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   reflecting our ongoing focus to control costs of continuing operations while disposing of our towing services segment and distribution group 
towing services revenues and cost of operations reflect the sale of the final towing services operations in these operations have been reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations based on certain on going cash flows via a long term licensing agreement 
the effective rate for the provision for income taxes for continuing operations was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  in prior years  we recorded a full valuation allowance reflecting the recognition that continuing losses from operations and certain liquidity matters indicated that it was unclear that certain future tax benefits would be realized through future taxable income 
discontinued operations net sales of discontinued operations decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net sales of the distribution group were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there were no net sales for the towing and recovery services segment during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of all remaining towing services operations being sold during cost of sales as a percentage of net sales for the distribution group was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  there were no costs of sales for the towing services segment during the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was for the distribution group and for the towing services segment for the year ended december  compared to and  respectively for the year ended december  increases in the percentage of sales for the distribution group were primarily the result of lower administrative expenses spread over a smaller revenue base  as we continue to sell distribution locations 
the effective rate for the provision for income taxes for discontinued operations was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  interest expense our total interest expense for continuing and discontinued operations decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable year ago period 
interest expense was million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations for the year ended december   compared to million for continuing operations and million for discontinued operations for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  includes commitment fees charged in conjunction with the maturing of our junior credit facility in july and the write off of unamortized loan costs from our senior credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  exclusive of unused availability under our credit facilities 
our primary cash requirements include working capital  capital expenditures and interest and principal payments on indebtedness under our credit facilities 
we expect our primary sources of cash to be cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  and borrowings from unused availability under our credit facilities 
we expect these sources to be sufficient to satisfy our cash needs during we recently determined to expand our existing manufacturing facilities in ooltewah  tennessee and hermitage  pennsylvania as a result of the recent increases in demand for our products 
the cost of these projects is anticipated to be approximately million 
we expect to fund these projects from cash flows and unused availability under our senior credit facility 
over the past year  we generally have used available cash flow to reduce the outstanding balance on our credit facilities and to pay down other long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in addition  our working capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant in connection with the increase in our manufacturing output to meet recent increases in demand for our products 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million used in operating activities for the year ended december  and million provided by operating activities for the year ended december  the cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  reflects increases in profitability partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory directly related to our revenue increases and increases in accounts payable and accruals to support increased productivity 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily from proceeds for the sale of distribution operations 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  paid down our credit facilities and repaid other outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for our continuing operations as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years outstanding borrowings under new senior credit facility outstanding borrowings under junior credit facility mortgage notes payable equipment notes payable capital lease obligations other notes payable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations represent open purchase orders for raw materials and other components issued in the normal course of business 
credit facilities and other obligations new senior credit facility on june   we entered into a credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association  for a million senior secured credit facility 
proceeds from this new senior credit facility were used to repay the cit group business credit  inc and william g 
miller  our chairman of the board and co chief executive officer  under our former senior credit facility 
as a result  effective june   our former senior credit facility was satisfied and terminated  and mr 
miller no longer holds any of our senior debt 
the new senior credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility  and a million term loan 
in the absence of a default  all new borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the libor market index rate as defined in the new credit agreement plus a margin of between to per annum that is subject to adjustment from time to time based upon the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the new credit agreement  and the term loan bears interest at a day adjusted libor rate plus a margin of between to per annum that is subject to adjustment based upon the consolidated leverage ratio 
the revolving credit facility expires on june   and the term loan matures on june  the new senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  and contains customary representations and warranties  events of default and affirmative and negative covenants for secured facilities of this type 
junior credit facility our junior credit facility is  by its terms  expressly subordinated only to the new senior credit facility  and is secured by a second priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our other assets 
the junior credit facility contains requirements for the maintenance of certain financial covenants  and also imposes restrictions on capital expenditures  incurrence of indebtedness  mergers and acquisitions  distributions and transfers and sales of assets 
the junior credit facility has been amended several times  most recently on june  during the second half of  contrarian funds  llc purchased all of the outstanding debt of the junior credit facility in a series of transactions 
as part of its purchase  contrarian also purchased warrants for shares of our common stock  which were subsequently exchanged for shares of our common stock 
in november  harbourside investments  lllp purchased of the subordinated debt and warrants from contrarian 
in february  contrarian and harbourside converted approximately million in debt under the junior credit facility into shares of our common stock 
in may  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to a small group of unaffiliated private investors  and the proceeds of this sale  together with additional borrowings under our former senior credit facility  were used to retire the portion of the junior credit facility owed to contrarian approximately million of principal and approximately  of accrued interest 
on may   harbourside was dissolved and distributed all of its shares of our common stock to its partners 
as a result  william g 
miller  as successor lender agent to harbourside  became the sole lender under the junior credit facility 
the june  amendment to the junior credit facility provided for a new term loan  made by mr 
miller as sole lender and successor lender agent  in the principal amount of approximately million 
as a result  on june   the total outstanding principal amount of term loans under the junior credit facility was million 
the amendment also extended the maturity date of the junior credit facility to september   and amended certain terms of the junior credit agreement to  among other things  make certain of the representations and warranties  covenants and events of default more consistent with the representations and warranties  covenants and events of default in the credit agreement for our new senior credit facility 
in the absence of a default  all of the term loans outstanding under the junior credit facility continue to bear interest at a rate of per annum 
former senior credit facility our former senior credit facility with cit and mr 
miller  which was terminated in june  consisted of an aggregate million credit facility  including a million revolving loan  a million term loan and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility provided for separate and distinct loan commitment levels for our towing and recovery equipment segment and roadone towing services segment  respectively 
borrowing availability under the revolving portion of the former senior credit facility was based on a percentage of eligible inventory and accounts receivable determined on eligibility criteria set forth in the credit facility and subject to a maximum borrowing limitation 
borrowings under the term loans were collateralized by substantially all of our domestic property  plants  and equipment 
the former senior credit facility bore interest at the prime rate as defined plus  subject to the rights of the senior lender agent or a majority of the lenders to charge a default rate equal to the prime rate as defined plus during the continuance of any event of default thereunder 
the former senior credit facility contained requirements relating to maintaining minimum excess availability at all times and minimum monthly levels of earnings before income taxes and depreciation and amortization as defined based on the most recently ended trailing three month period 
in addition  the former senior credit facility contained restrictions on capital expenditures  incurrence of indebtedness  mergers and acquisitions  distributions and transfers and sales of assets 
the former senior credit facility also contained requirements related to weekly and monthly collateral reporting 
interest rate sensitivity because of the amount of obligations outstanding under the new senior credit facility and the connection of the interest rate under such facility including the default rates to the libor rate  an increase in the libor rate could have a significant effect on our ability to satisfy our obligations under this facility and increase our interest expense significantly 
therefore  our liquidity and access to capital resources could be further affected by increasing interest rates 
outstanding borrowings outstanding borrowings under the senior and junior credit facilities as of december  and were as follows in thousands senior credit facility revolving credit facility term loan total junior credit facility total outstanding borrowings the substantial reductions in our overall indebtedness reflected above were primarily due to our improved operating cash flow resulting from increased sales levels and overall profitability 
other long term obligations in addition to the borrowings under the senior and junior credit facilities described above  we had approximately million of mortgage notes payable  equipment notes payable and other long term obligations at december  we also had approximately million in non cancellable operating lease obligations for continuing and discontinued operations
