the industry overall 
the united states processed food industry is generally characterized by relatively stable growth  based on modest price and population increases 
we believe that the long term fundamentals for the overall packaged food industry are favorable since these products are generally considered to be staple items for consumers to purchase 
while consumption growth is predicted to be modest in the united states  we believe that certain product categories that address changing consumer needs  such as tuna pouch  premium fruit  dry pet foods and pet snacks offer opportunities for faster growth 
we face substantial competition throughout our product lines from numerous well established businesses operating globally  nationally or regionally with single or multiple branded product lines 
we also face competition from private label manufacturers that compete for consumer preference  distribution  shelf space and merchandising support 
in addition  we also compete directly against other private label manufacturers with certain private label products 
we generally compete based upon brand strength and loyalty  product and packaging quality and innovation  taste  nutrition  breadth of our product line  price  and convenience 
a number of our competitors have broader product lines and substantially greater financial and other resources available to them 
food producers have been impacted by two key trends affecting their retail customers consolidation and increased competitive pressures 
retailers are rationalizing costs in an effort to improve profitability  including efforts to reduce inventory levels  increase supply chain efficiency and decrease working capital requirements 
in addition  more traditional grocers have experienced increasing competition from club stores  supercenters and mass merchandisers  which generally offer every day low prices 
retailer customers generally offer a private label store brand in addition to offering the number one and number two national or regional brands in different product categories 
sustaining strong relationships with retailers has become a critical success factor for food companies 
the market share data presented below excludes sales to certain mass merchandisers 
overall  recent sales in the retail grocery channel have been declining  partially due to a shift in sales away from traditional grocery channels towards club stores  supercenters  mass merchandisers  dollar stores and pet specialty stores 
therefore  the market share percentages presented below may not be representative of the entire market in which we compete 
references to trends for the markets in which we compete are based on internal estimates calculated from data obtained through acnielsen and household panel data and are intended to reflect estimates for all retail channels which include grocery  wal mart  club stores  dollar stores and pet specialty stores

our pet products categories participated in a multi billion dollar market which experienced an increase of approximately from fiscal to fiscal the markets in which we compete are dry and wet dog food  dry and wet cat food  and pet snacks 
we believe that growth in these categories has been fueled by steadily increasing pet ownership and higher spending as consumers treat pets as members of the family 
over half of all american households own pets

governmental regulation  environmental compliance as a manufacturer and marketer of food products  our operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal government agencies  including the food and drug administration  the united states department of agriculture  us customs and border protection  environmental protection agency and the federal trade commission ftc  as well as state and local agencies  with respect to registrations  production processes  product attributes  packaging  labeling  storage and distribution 
under various statutes and regulations  these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety  purity  performance and labeling 
our products must comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including food and drug laws  of the jurisdictions in which they are manufactured and marketed  such as the federal food  drug and cosmetic act of  as amended  and the federal fair packaging and labeling act of  as amended 
in addition  advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the ftc  and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations  including those issued under the occupational safety and health act 
our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state and local authorities 
we seek to comply with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses 
we believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain material compliance with current applicable governmental laws  regulations  permits and licenses 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that we are currently in compliance with all applicable laws  regulations  or requirements for permits or licenses nor that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or requirements for necessary permits and licenses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions

risk factors government regulation could increase our costs of production and increase legal and regulatory expenses and item legal proceedings 
we were a defendant in an action brought by the california attorney general in the superior court in san francisco  ca  on june  the attorney general alleged violations of california health safety code sections  et seq commonly known as proposition and california s unfair competition law for alleged failure to properly warn consumers of the presence of methylmercury in canned tuna 
see item legal proceedings and note commitments and contingencies of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal in this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of this matter 
we are a defendant in an action filed in the superior court in middlesex  nj  on may  see item legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of this matter 
as a result of our agricultural  food processing and canning activities  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the treatment  handling  storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties 
violations or non compliance with these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines or civil liability against us by governmental entities or private parties 
we seek to comply with these laws and regulations 
outside the united states  we are also subject to applicable multi national  national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries where we do business 
we have programs across our international business operations designed to meet compliance with requirements in the environmental area 
however  we cannot predict the extent to which the 
table of contents enforcement of any existing or future environmental law or regulation may affect our operations 
among the environmental matters currently affecting us are the following we are conducting groundwater remediation at our stockton  ca property associated with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination that resulted from the operations of a prior owner of the property 
we are remediating the contamination at the site 
we believe that we have accrued adequate reserves to cover any material liability that may result from this contamination 
we are investigating soil and groundwater contamination at our decatur  al property associated with the presence of dioxins that resulted from the operations of a prior owner of the property 
this facility was acquired in may in the meow mix acquisition 
in connection with our purchase accounting for the meow mix acquisition  reserves will be established that we believe will be adequate to cover any liability that may result from this contamination 
we expect to perform soil and groundwater investigation and remediation and site restoration at our terminal island  ca property as part of the closure and demolition of a facility  which was operated by a joint venture to which a former subsidiary was a party 
we assumed this liability pursuant to the merger agreement 
we are consulting with the port of los angeles  which owns the property where this facility is located  regarding the nature and scope of the investigation  remediation and restoration to be performed 
we believe that we have accrued adequate reserves to cover any material liability that may result from this investigation and remediation 
governmental authorities and private claimants have notified us that we may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain contaminated sites  including certain third party sites at which we disposed of wastes 
we may be liable for remediation costs at these sites as a result of alleged leaks  spills  releases or disposal of certain wastes or other substances at these sites 
with respect to a majority of these sites  we have settled our liability 
based upon the information currently available  we do not expect that our liability for the remaining sites will be material 
we may receive additional claims that we are potentially liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at other sites in the future 
our environmental expenditures in recent years have related to wastewater treatment systems  settlement of environmental litigation and remediation activities 
we project that we will spend approximately million in fiscal on capital projects and other expenditures in connection with environmental compliance for our existing businesses  primarily for compliance with wastewater treatment and remediation activities 
this includes capital expenditures to purchase land previously leased for wastewater treatment 
we believe that our environmental matters for fiscal will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  however a number of factors may affect our environmental compliance costs or accruals 
see item a 
risk factors we are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks  which may adversely affect our business 
the marine mammal protection act of and the regulations under this act  regulate the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean 
this is where a portion of our light meat tuna  including yellowfin  is currently caught 
in  the starkist seafood business voluntarily adopted a worldwide policy not to purchase tuna caught in the eastern tropical pacific ocean through the intentional encirclement of dolphin by purse seine nets and reaffirmed its policy not to purchase tuna caught anywhere using gill nets or drift nets 

table of contents also in  the dolphin protection consumer information act was enacted regulating the labeling of tuna products as dolphin safe and bans the importation of tuna caught using high seas drift nets 
the marine mammal protection act was amended in to further regulate tuna fishing methods that involve marine mammals 
compliance with these laws and regulations and starkist seafood s voluntary policy has not had  and is not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
in  congress passed the international dolphin conservation program act  which modified the regulation of the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean and revised the definition of dolphin safe 
despite the passage of the less restrictive international dolphin conservation program act  we remain committed to the more dolphin friendly standards of the marine mammal protection act 
revision of the definition of dolphin safe and modification of the regulation of the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean have not had  and management does not expect them to have  a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
seasonality  working capital our historical net sales have exhibited seasonality  with the first fiscal quarter typically having the lowest net sales 
lower levels of promotional activity  the availability of fresh produce  the timing of price increases and other factors have historically affected net sales in the first quarter 
we have experienced increased sales of our fruit  vegetable  tomato and broth products during the holiday and back to school periods in the united states  extending from september through december  as well as sales associated with the easter holiday 
we have also experienced increases in pet snacks sales during the year end holiday period 
sales of our tuna products are usually higher during the period after new year s day through the easter holiday 
we typically schedule promotional events to coincide with these periods of increased product consumption 
we use cash from operations in addition to our revolving line of credit to fund our working capital needs 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future based upon a number of factors 
our working capital requirements are seasonally affected by the growing cycle of some of the products we process 
our inventory position for these products is also seasonally affected by this growing cycle 
the vast majority of del monte brands inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
accordingly  the majority of our cash flow is generated in our third and fourth quarter as we sell inventory that was produced primarily in the first and second quarters 
this seasonality factor also has an effect  but to a lesser extent  upon our results of operations 
tuna and pet products are produced throughout the year 
employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees in the us and abroad 
in addition  temporary seasonal workers are hired during the del monte brands pack season  typically june through october  adding approximately  seasonal employees to our workforce during those months 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
in connection with our recent acquisitions after our april  fiscal year end  our full time employee count increased by approximately employees 
as of april   we had collective bargaining agreements with union locals covering approximately of our hourly full time and seasonal employees 
of these employees  approximately are covered under collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in fiscal  and approximately are covered under collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in fiscal these agreements are subject to negotiation and renewal 
failure to renew any of these collective bargaining agreements could result in a strike or work stoppage that could 
table of contents materially adversely affect our operations 
in connection with our recent acquisition of milk bone  we assumed three collective bargaining agreements with three union locals covering approximately employees

risk factors factors that may affect our future results and stock price we are subject to many risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance and our stock price 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our financial performance to vary or that may materially or adversely affect our financial performance or stock price are discussed below 
if we do not successfully integrate the meow mix and milk bone businesses  we may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions 
the process of integrating the meow mix and milk bone businesses with our existing businesses may involve a variety of difficulties and challenges  including the challenge of accomplishing this integration while managing the ongoing operations of each acquired and existing business  the challenge of accomplishing this integration while effecting the transformation plan  the challenge of integrating the business cultures of the meow mix and milk bone businesses with that of del monte  the challenge of establishing appropriate controls and procedures over the acquired meow mix and milk bone businesses  and the need to retain key personnel of the meow mix and milk bone businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully or cost effectively integrate the meow mix and milk bone businesses and our existing businesses 
accordingly  we may be unable to obtain synergies expected in connection with the meow mix acquisition and dis synergies associated with the milk bone acquisition may be higher than expected 
additionally  the process of integrating the meow mix and milk bone businesses could cause interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the meow mix  milk bone or existing businesses 
members of our senior management and other employees may be required to devote considerable time to the integration process  which will decrease the time they will have to devote to our business 
the failure to effectively integrate the meow mix and milk bone businesses  including failure to obtain expected synergies  manage dis synergies or effectively manage the acquired and existing businesses despite the demands of the integration process  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the failure to establish appropriate controls and procedures over the acquired meow mix and milk bone businesses could adversely affect our internal controls over financial reporting as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the inputs  commodities  ingredients and raw materials that we require are subject to price increases and shortages that could adversely affect our profitability 
we may be unable to effectively pass increased costs along to our customers 
the primary inputs  commodities  ingredients and other raw materials that we use include energy  fuel  packaging including cans  fruits  vegetables  tomatoes  tuna  grains  sugar  spices  meats  meat by products  soybean meal  fats  oils and chemicals 
prices for these items may be volatile and we may experience shortages in these items as a result of external conditions  commodity market 
table of contents fluctuations  availability  increased demand  weather conditions  natural disasters  currency fluctuations  governmental regulations  including import restrictions  agricultural programs or issues  and other factors outside our control 
input  commodity  ingredient and other raw material price increases or shortages may result in higher costs or interrupt our production schedules  each of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
production delays could lead to reduced sales volumes and profitability as well as loss of market share 
higher costs could adversely impact our earnings 
for example  fuel prices affect our transportation costs for both raw materials and finished product and natural gas prices also affect our production costs 
even if we increase pricing in an effort to offset higher costs  such increased pricing may result in reduced sales volume and profitability 
additionally  if we increase our prices  we may need to increase marketing spending  including trade promotion spending  in order to retain our market share 
such increased marketing costs may significantly offset the benefits  if any  of any price increase 
if we are not able to effectively pass cost increases along to our customers  our operating income will decrease 
our competitors may be better able than we are to effect price increases or to otherwise pass along cost increases to their customers 
if costs remain at their current high levels  our projected financial results could be adversely affected 
we are currently experiencing high prices for some of the inputs  commodities  ingredients and other raw materials we use 
in particular  we are experiencing high fuel and natural gas prices 
if our assessments and assumptions about input and commodity prices  as well as ingredient and other raw material prices  prove to be incorrect  our costs may be greater than anticipated 
if we are not able to effectively pass cost increases along to our customers or secure offsetting cost savings  our operating income will decrease and our operating results will be adversely impacted 
in particular  shortages of tinplate and increases in  or continuing high  tinplate prices could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
disruptions in our supply of cans and ends  whether caused by tinplate shortages or other factors  could also adversely affect our results of operations 
many of our products are packed in tinplate cans 
we have experienced  and may experience in the future  tinplate shortages and increased tinplate prices 
the price and availability of tinplate is subject to factors outside our control  including factors affecting the steel industry generally 
such factors may include increased demand from other users of tinplate or other forms of steel  import restrictions  government regulations  and competition among  and the financial condition of  steel suppliers 
if silgan or impress is unable to secure tinplate  our supply of cans and ends may be interrupted 
any disruption in our supply of cans and ends  whether due to tinplate shortages  can and end manufacturing defects  strikes affecting our suppliers  or otherwise  could delay or disrupt our production of product and adversely affect our results of operations 
if events occur that result in increased  or continuing high  tinplate costs or in tinplate shortages whether due to factors affecting tinplate specifically or the steel industry generally  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
increases in logistics and other transportation related costs could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
our ability to competitively serve our customers depends on the availability of reliable and low cost transportation 
logistics and other transportation related costs have a significant impact on our earnings and results of operations 
we use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market 
they include 
table of contents ships  trucks  intermodals and railcars 
disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason  including availability or cost of fuel  regulations affecting the industry  or labor shortages in the transportation industry  could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness and the amount of our indebtedness increased substantially in early fiscal as a result of the meow mix and milk bone acquisitions 
as of april   we had a total of  million of indebtedness 
on july   immediately following the closing of the milk bone acquisition and including other borrowings made on such date under our revolving credit facility  we had a total of  million of indebtedness  including million under our million revolving credit facility  which is part of our credit facility 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth  acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other cash requirements  limiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements  limiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business due to debt service requirements  limiting our ability to compete with companies that are less leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns  increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions  and making us vulnerable to fluctuations in market interest rates  to the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates 
if our cash from operations is not sufficient to enable us to reduce our debt as anticipated  our interest expense could be materially higher than anticipated and our financial performance could be adversely affected 
if our cash from operations is not sufficient to meet our expenses and debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance our debt  sell assets  borrow additional money or raise equity 
we expect to generate the funds necessary to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt from our operations 
because portions of our business are highly seasonal  our borrowings under our revolving credit facility usually fluctuate during the year  generally peaking in september or october 
our ability to generate cash to meet our expenses and debt service obligations and to otherwise reduce our debt as anticipated will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative  regulatory and other factors  including potential changes in consumer preferences  the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
any factor that negatively affects our results of operations  including our cash flow  may also negatively affect our ability to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt 
if we are unable to reduce our debt as anticipated  our interest expense could be materially higher than anticipated and our financial performance could be adversely affected 

table of contents if we do not have enough cash to pay our debt service obligations  we may be required to amend our credit facility or indentures  refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  incur additional indebtedness or raise equity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able  at any given time  to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us or at all 
despite our significant indebtedness  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt through additional borrowings 
this could further exacerbate the risks described above 
while our credit facility generally restricts borrowings outside the existing facility  it does permit additional indebtedness pursuant to specified exceptions 
for example  subject to satisfaction of debt incurrence tests contained in our senior subordinated note indentures and other conditions including pro forma covenant compliance  we are permitted to incur an amount not to exceed million of additional unsecured indebtedness and we are permitted to borrow  subject to the willingness of lenders to fund such borrowing and other conditions  an additional million through an increase in the term loan facility under our existing credit facility 
further  with the concurrence of our senior lenders and satisfaction of our note indenture debt incurrence tests  we could incur substantial additional indebtedness 
additionally  we have the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness pursuant to our million revolving credit facility  which is part of our credit facility 
if our current debt level increases  the related risks we face could intensify 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility and indentures may restrict our operational flexibility 
our ability to comply with these restrictions depends on many factors beyond our control 
our credit facility and indentures include certain covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  issue preferred stock  pay dividends on  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  make other restricted payments  including investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and transfer all or substantially all of our assets and enter into mergers or consolidations 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will comply with these ratios and tests 
our credit facility may also limit our ability to agree to certain change of control transactions  because a change of control as defined in the credit facility will result in an event of default 
a breach of any of the covenants  ratios  tests or restrictions contained in our credit facility or indentures could result in an event of default under the credit facility and under our indentures in which case the amounts outstanding under the credit facility and indentures could be declared immediately due and payable 
if the payment of the indebtedness is accelerated  we cannot assure 
table of contents you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and any other indebtedness that would become due as a result of any acceleration 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies to reduce costs 
failure to reduce costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to reduce costs 
because our ability to raise prices for our products can be affected by factors outside of our control  such as aggregate industry supply and market demand  our profitability and growth depends significantly on our efforts to control our operating costs 
because many of our costs  such as energy  fuel  can  logistics  and other input  commodity  ingredient  and raw material costs  are outside or substantially outside our control  we generally must seek to reduce costs in other areas  such as operating efficiency 
if we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget  if at all  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date  or any future cost savings initiatives  do not generate expected cost savings and synergies  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
transformation endeavors may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and financial results 
in addition to efforts related to our strategic plan  which is described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have adopted a plan to transform certain aspects of our company 
such plan includes headcount reduction as part of organizational streamlining 
if the implementation of this headcount reduction has a negative impact on our relationships with employees  major customers or vendors or on our ability to run our businesses  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our transformation plan also involves projects relating to our supply chain  manufacturing  customer relationships and marketing capabilities 
if our transformation efforts disrupt our supply chain  manufacturing activities  customer service and relationships  trade promotion programs or other business activities  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to successfully implement our transformation plan  we may not be able to fully recognize the estimated cost benefits and our financial results would be adversely affected 
if the costs associated with the transformation plan are greater than expected  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may in the future contemplate and adopt additional plans  which may also include restructuring components 
such plans  if any  that are implemented  may  but need not  involve disposal of plants  distribution centers  businesses or other assets as well as additional headcount reductions or reductions in the number of product offerings  which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
divesting plants  distribution centers  businesses or other assets or changes in strategy may also adversely impact our results of operations due to related write offs or due to the loss of operating income that may be associated with any such disposed business 
additionally  restructuring or disposition efforts including transition efforts following a disposition  such as in connection with our april  sale of our soup and infant feeding businesses may divert management s and other employee s attention from other business concerns  including our integration efforts 
we may be unable to complete dispositions we may desire to undertake at targeted prices  if at all  which may adversely impact our financial results and our ability to implement our business strategies 
we may not be able to successfully introduce new products  which could decrease our profitability 
our future business and financial growth depend  in part  on our ability to successfully introduce new products and improved products 
we introduce new products and improved products in all of our businesses from time to time 
our strategy to grow our profits depends on product innovation 
we 
table of contents incur significant development and marketing costs in connection with the introduction of new products 
successfully launching and selling new products puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources 
if customers and consumers do not accept a new product  then the introduction of a new product can reduce our operating income as introduction costs  including slotting fees  may exceed revenues 
if we are not consistently successful in marketing and selling new products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected  our revenues could decrease  our growth rate could drop  and our profitability could decline 
if we do not compete successfully and maintain or improve the market shares of our products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
our businesses are highly competitive 
there are numerous brands and products that compete for shelf space and sales  with competition based primarily on quality  breadth of product line  brand awareness  price  taste  nutrition  variety  packaging and value added customer services such as inventory management services 
we compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes  including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies 
our branded products face strong competition from private label products  imports  other national and regional brands and fresh alternatives 
in our private label sales  we face strong competition at the customer level against other private label providers 
at the consumer level  our private label products face strong competition from branded products  other private label products  imports and fresh alternatives 
a number of our competitors have broader product lines  substantially greater financial and other resources and or lower fixed costs than we have 
our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products that are more attractive to customers or consumers than ours 
these competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling their products than we are  and may be better able to increase prices to reflect current cost pressures 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully with these other companies or maintain or grow the distribution of our products 
we cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us 
many of our competitors  including those in the pet products  tuna  tomato and fruit businesses  engage in aggressive pricing and promotional activities 
additionally  our acquisition of the meow mix and milk bone businesses may induce pet products competitors to increase competitive activity directed at our products 
there are competitive pressures and other factors which could cause our products to lose market share or decline in sales or result in significant price or margin erosion  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to increase prices for our products  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if price increases result in greater than expected volume sales losses  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to raise prices for our products can be affected by a number of factors  including aggregate industry supply  market demand  and competition 
if we are unable to increase prices for our products  particularly as may be necessary to cover cost increases  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
additionally  price increases typically generate volume losses  as consumers purchase fewer units 
if such losses also referred to as the elasticity impact are greater than expected or if we lose distribution in retribution of a price increase  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we do not successfully manage the price gap between our branded products and those of our private label competition  our sales could suffer and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our branded products generally command a price premium as compared to the prices of the private label products with which they compete 
this price premium has been increasing for certain of our 
table of contents products  as private label competition has been slower in effecting price increases 
the willingness of consumers to pay a price premium for our branded products depends on a number of factors  including the effectiveness of our marketing programs and the existing strength of our brands 
if the price premium for our branded products exceeds the amount consumers are willing to pay  our sales would suffer and our revenues and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
some of our co packers are competitors 
we have co pack arrangements with competitors for some of our pet  vegetable and tomato paste products  as well as for a portion of our tuna supply 
these co pack arrangements may provide competitors with know how or other information or economies of scale that enable them to compete more effectively against us 
in addition  to the extent that a co packer is also a competitor  we may be at greater risk of supply disruption  in spite of contractual protections  in the event of raw material  commodity or ingredient shortages or other circumstances 
any such disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations 
we will not benefit from preferential tax treatment for our products produced in american samoa if the legislation providing for such treatment is not renewed 
section of the internal revenue code generally provided a federal income tax credit for income earned from a business conducted within a united states possession  however  this legislation expired in december  affecting fiscal years beginning after such expiration date 
we received the benefit of this credit with respect to income from our canned tuna business in american samoa throughout fiscal  which resulted in fiscal savings of approximately million in tax expense 
we cannot assure you that the legislation providing for this federal income tax credit will be renewed or that similar legislation will be adopted 
if such legislation is not renewed or adopted  our effective federal income tax rate on income attributable to our operations in american samoa will increase and our net profits will decrease 
we rely primarily upon a single company to provide us with logistics services and any failure by this provider to effectively service us could adversely affect our business 
our logistics requirements in connection with transporting our products are handled by our third party logistics service provider 
such services include scheduling and coordinating transportation of our finished products to our distribution centers and customers  shipment tracking and communication  freight dispatch services  shipment optimization using various shipping modes  carriers  routes and configurations  transportation related payment and billing services  and tracking  asserting  collecting and resolving freight claims 
our business could suffer substantial disruption if our third party provider does not effectively fulfill its obligations 
our operating results will depend  in part  on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs 
in general  due to the highly competitive nature of the businesses in which we compete  we must increase or maintain our level of promotional and marketing investment with respect to our businesses to sustain our competitive position in our markets 
the effectiveness of our marketing practices and advertising campaigns is important to our ability to retain or improve our market share or margins 
we expect to continue to expend significant marketing and advertising resources on a number of our businesses  including pet products and tuna pouch products  which we believe are in product categories that respond favorably to marketing and advertising 
if our marketing and advertising campaigns are not successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 

table of contents changes in our marketing and pricing strategies may adversely impact our market share and results of operations 
we may  from time to time  change our marketing and pricing strategies  including the timing of our promotional programs 
for example  we have changed our pricing and marketing strategies with respect to certain of our tuna products  which may adversely affect our market share and net sales of such products 
to the extent that higher prices for these products do not offset such market share and net sales losses  such strategy may also adversely affect our earnings 
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  which may result in decreased demand for our products 
our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes  dietary habits and trends and product packaging preferences of consumers and  as applicable  their pets  in the market categories in which we compete 
if we are not able to anticipate  identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences  demand for our products may decline and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully maintain the level of our product distribution to high volume club stores and mass merchandisers  which could adversely impact our net sales and results of operations 
the success of our business strategy depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the level of our product distribution  and consequently our sales  through high volume club stores  such as sam s club and costco  supercenters and mass merchandisers  such as wal mart supercenters 
consumers are increasingly shopping at club stores and mass merchandisers as an alternative to traditional grocery channels 
if we are unable to maintain the level of our sales and product distribution through these channels  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the competition to supply products to these high volume stores is intense  particularly where a store elects to carry only one of a particular type of product 
these high volume club stores and mass merchandisers frequently re evaluate the products they carry and if a major club customer elected to stop carrying one of our products  our sales could be adversely affected 
some customer buying decisions are based upon a periodic bidding process in which the successful bidder is only assured of selling its selected products to the club store until the next bidding process 
our sales volume could decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell products  even temporarily  through these channels 
conversely  we risk depressing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price points 
either of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in order to maintain key volume in the face of competition  we may agree to supply customers below desired price points  which could also depress our margins 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of customers  the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations 
a relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our total sales 
during fiscal  our top customer  wal mart including wal mart s stores and supercenters as well as sam s club  represented approximately of our list sales  which approximates our gross sales  overall and an even higher percentage of sales of our pet products business 
our ten largest customers represented approximately of our overall list sales 
these percentages may increase if there is additional consolidation among food retailers or if the growth of mass merchandisers continues 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers 
our customers are generally not contractually obligated to purchase from us 
these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price  product quality  
table of contents consumer demand  customer service performance and their desired inventory levels 
changes in our customers strategies  including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or a shift of shelf space to private label products unless we provide such products may adversely affect our sales 
additionally  our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our sales of products to one or more of these customers are reduced  this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
bankruptcy or other business disruption of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations 
loss of a significant customer could also adversely affect our reputation 
large sophisticated customers may pressure us to lower our prices  not institute price increases  or take other actions that may adversely impact our results of operations 
there has been a consumer trend away from traditional grocers and towards mass merchandisers  which includes club stores and super centers 
this trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of these mass merchandisers 
as these mass merchandisers grow larger and become more sophisticated  these food retailers may demand lower or unchanged pricing  increased promotional programs or special packaging from  or impose other requirements on  product suppliers 
these business demands may relate to inventory practices  logistics or other aspects of the customer supplier relationship 
for example  wal mart and other customers have indicated a desire to utilize radio frequency identification rfid technology in an effort to improve tracking and management of product in their supply chain 
large scale implementation of this technology would significantly increase our product manufacturing and distribution costs 
meeting demands by our customers may adversely affect our margins and results of operations 
if we are not selected by our large food retailer customers for most of our products or if we fail to effectively respond to their demands  our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
to the extent our customers purchase product in excess of consumer consumption in any period  our sales in a subsequent period may be adversely affected as customers seek to reduce their inventory levels 
to the extent customers seek to reduce their usual or customary inventory levels  our sales may be adversely affected 
from time to time  customers may purchase more product than they expect to sell to consumers during a particular time period 
customers may grow their inventory in anticipation of  or during  our promotional events  which typically provide for reduced prices during a specified time or other customer or consumer incentives 
customers may also grow inventory in anticipation of a price increase for our products 
if a customer increases its inventory during a particular reporting period as a result of a promotional event  anticipated price increase or otherwise  then sales during the subsequent reporting period may be adversely impacted as customers seek to reduce their inventory to usual levels 
this effect may be particularly pronounced when the promotional event  price increase or other event occurs near the end or beginning of a reporting period 
to the extent customers seek to reduce their usual or customary inventory levels  the impact of such de inventorying would be even greater 
we use a single national broker to represent a significant portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us would adversely affect our business 
we use a single national broker to represent a significant portion of our branded products to the retail grocery trade 
our business would suffer substantial disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade 
changes in our sales strategy may impact this relationship 

table of contents if our assessments and assumptions about commodity prices  as well as ingredient and other prices  prove to be incorrect in connection with our hedging or forward buy efforts or planning cycles  our costs may be greater than anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 
we generally use commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases of corn  wheat  soybean meal and soybean oil used in the production of certain of our products 
additionally  we have a hedging program for heating oil as a proxy for fluctuations in diesel fuel prices as well as a hedging program relating to natural gas 
the extent of our hedges at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities  diesel fuel and natural gas  including our assumptions about future prices 
for example  if we believe market prices for the commodities we use are unusually high  we may choose to hedge less  or even none  of our upcoming requirements 
if we fail to hedge and prices subsequently increase  or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease  our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors costs and our financial results could be adversely affected 
concerns regarding methylmercury in seafood products  including tuna  could adversely affect our business 
a consumer advisory jointly issued by the us food and drug administration and the environmental protection agency the epa provided some consumers in particular  women who may become pregnant  pregnant women  nursing mothers and young children with information emphasizing the value of fish and shellfish in healthy diets and the need to limit their dietary exposure to methylmercury found in certain sea foods  including tuna 
this advisory was focused on specific consumer populations that are most susceptible to the harmful effects of methylmercury 
with respect to canned tuna  health officials advised that these certain consumers can eat up to ounces of light tuna or six ounces of white tuna per week 
discussions  stories  concerns and warnings regarding mercury levels in seafood  including tuna  appear in various media outlets and other venues with increasing frequency 
we may be adversely affected by this publicity and the recently announced guidance as well as any future warnings  guidance  recommendations  developments or publicity 
consumer perceptions that consumption of canned tuna should be limited may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we are subject to product liability claims  we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and adverse public relations if consumption  use or opening of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims 
for example  punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance 
we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
a product liability judgment against us or our agreement to settle a product liability claim could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures  which would reduce operating profit and cash flow 
in addition  even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully pursued  these claims would likely be costly and time consuming and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business 
product liability claims  or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands with high quality and safe products  may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products 
product liability claims may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands  business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if we experience product recalls  we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected 
we may be exposed to product recalls  including voluntary recalls  and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations 
we may also voluntarily recall products that we consider below our standards  whether for taste  appearance or otherwise  in order to protect our brand reputation 
a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures  which would reduce operating profit and cash flow 
in addition  a product recall may require significant management attention 
product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products 
product recalls may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands  business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be successful in our future acquisition endeavors  if any  which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have historically engaged in substantial acquisition activity 
we may be unable to identify suitable targets  opportunistic or otherwise  for acquisition in the future 
if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate  our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements 
if we need to obtain our lenders consent to an acquisition  they may refuse to provide such consent or condition their consent on our compliance with additional restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility 
acquisitions involve risks  including those associated with integrating the operations  financial reporting  disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies  managing geographically dispersed operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience  unknown risks  and the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies 
we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
acquisitions may be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of  among other things  the incurrence of debt  one time write offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets 
in addition  future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 
changes in weather conditions and natural disasters can affect crop or fish supplies  which can adversely affect our operations and our results of operations 
changes in weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  earthquakes or pestilence  may affect the cost and supply of commodities  ingredients and raw materials  including fruits  vegetables  tomatoes  grain  beef  sugar and spices 
additionally  these events can result in reduced supplies of raw materials  lower recoveries of usable raw materials  higher costs of cold storage if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable or interruptions in our production schedules if harvests are delayed 
competing manufacturers can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations 
changes in the weather may also change the thermoclines in which fish such as tuna may be located 
if fish are driven to lower thermoclines  it may be harder for fishermen to catch these fish  which could reduce the supply of tuna 
in addition  some scientists believe that the population of some larger fish species has been depleted due to over fishing  potentially affecting the current and future supply of tuna 
if our supplies of raw materials are reduced  we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms  if at all  which could impact our ability to supply 
table of contents product to our customers and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased costs for raw materials could also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
natural disasters can disrupt our operations  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our executive offices  one of our research centers  and some of our fruit  vegetable and tomato operations are located where earthquakes can occur 
additionally  some of our tuna operations are located in areas where natural disasters such as hurricanes can occur 
if our operations are damaged by a natural disaster  we may be subject to supply interruptions or other business disruption  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
inventory in our del monte brands operating segment s results of operations is highly seasonal 
interference with our production schedule during peak months or inventory shortages could negatively impact our results of operations 
we do not manufacture the majority of our del monte brands products continuously throughout the year  but instead have a seasonal production period that is limited to approximately three to four months primarily during the summer each year 
we refer to this period as the pack season 
an unexpected plant shutdown or any other material interference with our production schedule could adversely affect our results of operations 
in the majority of our del monte brands businesses  the inventory created during the pack season  plus any inventory carried over from the previous pack season  determines the quantity of inventory we have available for sale until the next pack season commences 
the size of the pack is influenced by crop results  which is affected by weather and other factors 
similarly  the timing of the pack season depends upon crop timing  which in turn is affected by weather and other factors 
in the event that the inventory produced during the pack season is less than desired  or if the new pack season is delayed  or if demand for product is greater than forecasted  we may be required to allocate or limit sales of some items to customers in an effort to stretch supplies until the new pack season begins and new product is available 
we could also experience inventory shortages in the event of can or end defects  whether discovered during the pack season or thereafter  or other factors 
in the event we are required to allocate or limit sales of some items  we may lose sales volume and market share and our customer relationships may be harmed 
we rely upon co packers to provide our supply of some products 
any failure by co packers to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have a number of supply agreements with co packers that require them to provide us with specific finished products 
for some of our products  including each of canned pineapple  mandarins and tropical fruits  some fruit in plastic containers  some fruit in glass jars  some dog snack and pet food products  and most of our tuna pouch products  we essentially rely upon a single co packer as our sole source for the product 
we also anticipate that we will rely on sole suppliers for future products 
the failure for any reason of any such sole source or other co packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods and have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
additionally  from time to time  a co packer may experience financial difficulties or bankruptcy  which could disrupt our supply of finished goods or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption  such as establishing a new co pack arrangement with another provider 
a new co pack arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as the existing co pack arrangement  if at all 

table of contents the terms in our supply agreement for cans and ends with impress could adversely affect the profitability of our products 
impress supplies metal cans and ends for our pet and tuna businesses 
our agreement with impress includes minimum volume purchase requirements and guarantees a minimum financial return to impress 
these terms may result in increases in the unit costs of our pet and tuna products if we reduce our production levels 
we are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks  which may adversely affect our business 
as a result of our agricultural and food processing operations  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and compliance with them is becoming increasingly expensive 
we cannot predict the extent to which any environmental law or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at some designated superfund sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  or under similar state laws 
we are defending ourselves in these actions as we believe appropriate 
however  we cannot assure you that none of these matters will adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
we may in the future be named as a prp at other currently or previously owned or operated sites  and additional remediation requirements could be imposed on us 
other properties where we conduct or have conducted operations could be identified for investigation or proposed for listing under cercla or similar state laws 
also  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the food quality protection act of  the us environmental protection agency is involved in a series of regulatory actions relating to the evaluation and use of pesticides in the food industry 
the effect of these actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
the maximum achievable control technology mact and other regulations promulgated under the clean air act may also impact our operations and require that we expend additional capital to meet such requirements 
if the cost of compliance with applicable environmental laws or regulations increases  our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
government regulation could increase our costs of production and increase legal and regulatory expenses 
manufacturing  processing  labeling  packaging  storing and distributing food products are activities that are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
these aspects of our operations are regulated by the us food and drug administration fda  the united states department of agriculture usda and various state and local public health and agricultural agencies 
in addition to periodic government agency inspections affecting our operations generally  our operations  which produce meat and poultry products  are subject to mandatory continuous on site inspections by the usda 
complying with government regulation  including any new regulations such as the new federal country of origin labeling cool labeling requirements  can be costly 
failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including  among others  california s proposition  could subject us to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is also affected by import and export controls and similar laws and regulations 
issues such as national security or health and safety  which slow or otherwise restrict imports  could adversely affect our business 
in addition  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the way that we have historically operated our business 

table of contents failure by third party co packers to comply with environmental or other regulations may disrupt our supply of certain products and adversely affect our financial performance 
we rely on co packers to produce certain of our products 
such co packers  whether in the us or overseas  are subject to a number of regulations  including environmental regulations 
failure by any of our co packers to comply with regulations  or allegations of compliance failure  may disrupt their operations 
for example  our co packer in ecuador  which produces a substantial portion of our retail tuna pouch products  experienced environmental compliance issues and was closed briefly in fiscal disruption of the operations of a co packer could disrupt our supply of product  which could have an adverse effect on our net sales and other results of operations 
additionally  actions we may take to mitigate the impact of any such disruption or potential disruption  including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production interruption  may adversely affect our results of operations 
if we are unable to renew our lease in terminal island  ca  we may incur expenses that could materially adversely affect our earnings 
the current ground lease for our facilities in terminal island  ca terminated may  we believe we have negotiated an up to three and a half year extension of this lease 
if we are unable to enter into an agreement reflecting such extension on these or substantially similar terms  we would accelerate certain demolition  remediation and relocation expenses and be responsible for reimbursing certain third party costs and losses 
these expenses could materially adversely affect our earnings 
risk associated with foreign operations  including changes in import export duties  wage rates  political or economic climates  or exchange rates  may adversely affect our operations 
our foreign operations and relationships with foreign suppliers and co packers subject us to the risks of doing business abroad 
the countries from which we source our products may be subject to political and economic instability  and may periodically enact new or revise existing laws  taxes  duties  quotas  tariffs  currency controls or other restrictions to which we are subject 
our products are subject to import duties and other restrictions  and the united states government may periodically impose new or revise existing duties  quotas  tariffs or other restrictions to which we are subject 
for example  we currently import tuna pouch products from ecuador on a duty free basis under the andean trade preference and drug eradication act atpdea  which expires december  if new legislation is not adopted that provides similar benefits to the atpdea  our costs could increase and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  steps we may take to mitigate the impact of the expiration of the atpdea in the short term  such as accelerating our production of affected products and increasing our inventories  could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  changes in respective wage rates among the countries from which we and our competitors source product could substantially impact our competitive position 
for example  wage rates in american samoa are currently substantially higher than wage rates in thailand 
however  this wage rate difference is generally offset by the fact that us tariffs are currently imposed on thai products but not on american samoa products 
changes in exchange rates  import export duties or relative international wage rates applicable to us or our competitors whether due to an increase in wage rates in american samoa  a decrease of wage rates elsewhere  or otherwise could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations and require us to restructure our business in order to remain competitive 
because our competitors may have operations in different foreign jurisdictions than we have  such changes may impact us in a different manner than our competitors 

table of contents if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  we may harm our ability to compete 
our brand names and trademarks  including the marks del monte  starkist  lives  kibbles n bits  meow mix  and milk bone  are important to our business 
we rely on trademark  copyright  trade secret  patent and other intellectual property laws  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary information  technologies and processes 
we also have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of third party intellectual property 
we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation  infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some foreign countries 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations 
intellectual property infringement claims may adversely impact our results of operations 
as we develop  introduce and acquire products  we may be increasingly subject to claims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property 
such claims may require us to change our products  cease selling certain products or engage in litigation to determine the scope and validity of such claims 
any of such events may adversely impact our results of operations 
our business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages by del monte employees 
as of april   we have collective bargaining agreements with union locals covering approximately of our hourly full time and seasonal employees 
of these employees  approximately are covered under collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in fiscal  and approximately are covered under collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire in fiscal we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate these or other collective bargaining agreements on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements  or at all  without production interruptions caused by labor stoppages 
if a strike or work stoppage were to occur in connection with negotiations of new collective bargaining agreements  or as a result of disputes under our collective bargaining agreements with labor unions  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in connection with our recent acquisition of milk bone  we assumed three collective bargaining agreements with three union locals covering approximately employees 
our del monte brand name could be confused with names of other companies who  by their act or omission  could adversely affect the value of the del monte brand name 
we have licensed the del monte brand name and with respect to the philippines and south africa  transferred title to various unaffiliated companies internationally and  for some products  in the united states 
the common stock of one licensee  fresh del monte produce inc  is publicly traded in the united states 
acts or omissions by these unaffiliated companies may adversely affect the value of the del monte brand name  the trading prices for our common stock and demand for our products 
third party announcements or rumors about these licensees could also have these negative effects 
in addition  in connection with the merger  heinz retained its ownership of some of the brand names used by our businesses in countries in which we do not compete 
acts or omissions by heinz or its licensees that adversely affect the value of these brand names may also adversely affect demand for our products

table of contents part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities common stock prices del monte foods company common stock trades on the new york stock exchange the nyse under the symbol dlm 
we voluntarily de listed from the pacific exchange during fiscal due to the limited volume traded on that exchange 
the following table sets forth the high and the low sale prices for del monte foods company common stock as reported by the nyse for the periods indicated high low fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dividend policy prior to fiscal  we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock since our initial public offering in february we declared aggregate dividends of approximately million during fiscal  of which approximately million of such dividends were paid during fiscal the dividends were declared in december and march and were paid in february and may  respectively 
in each case  the dividend declared and paid was per share of outstanding common stock of dmfc 
our credit facility and indentures generally limit  subject to certain financial tests and other exceptions  the ability of dmc to make cash payments to dmfc  which therefore limits dmfc s ability to pay cash dividends 
under the credit facility  as amended  one of the exceptions provides that so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom  dmc may pay dividends to dmfc in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of i million plus ii of consolidated net income of dmfc determined on a cumulative basis from october   plus iii at such time as no more than million in principal amount of del monte s senior subordinated notes due remain outstanding  an additional million  provided that no dividend payment may be made under the credit facility if the making of such dividend payment would violate applicable provisions of del monte s indentures 
as of april   the amount available to be paid as additional dividends by dmc to dmfc under this provision of the credit facility was approximately million 
the restriction on dmc dividends described above currently is more restrictive than the comparable provisions in the indentures 
to the extent that dmc pays cash dividends to dmfc and dmfc uses such cash dividends for purposes other than dividends to its stockholders  such as stock repurchases  dmfc s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders effectively will be limited further 

table of contents we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends 
however  there can be no assurance that future dividends will be declared or paid 
the actual declaration and payment of future dividends  and the establishment of record and payment dates  if any  is subject to final determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our then current strategy  applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position  among other things see item a

excluding commission payable to goldman sachs  the shares were repurchased for an upfront payment of approximately million or per share  subject to a price adjustment provision 
the repurchased shares are being held in treasury 
in connection with the june  asb  goldman sachs was expected to purchase an equivalent amount of shares in the open market over time 
at the end of the program  we were to pay a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of shares traded during the purchase period 
approximately half of the shares purchased in connection with the june  asb were subject to a collar  a contract that sets a minimum and maximum price for purposes of calculating the price adjustment 
generally  the purchase price adjustment could have been settled  at our option  in cash or in shares of our common stock 
as described under dividend policy above  in december  we declared a cash dividend of per share on our common stock 
pursuant to the june  asb with goldman sachs  the declaration of such dividend constituted an extraordinary dividend as defined in the june  asb and provided goldman sachs with the right to terminate the june  asb 
on december   goldman sachs notified us of its intent to terminate the june  asb 
table of contents effective as of the close of business on such date 
the termination did not affect the retirement of the shares previously repurchased by us but  as described below  affected the timing and amount of payments between the parties with respect to the june  asb 
simultaneously with the termination of the june  asb  on december   we entered into a new collared accelerated share repurchase arrangement the december  asb with goldman sachs based on  shares to complete the balance of the june  asb 
as a result  the new arrangement required us and goldman sachs to settle the price adjustment with respect to the  shares already purchased by goldman sachs based on their actual cost to purchase the shares in the open market between july  and december  the aggregate amount required to be paid by us to goldman sachs under the june  asb  which included the amount of the price adjustment for the  shares purchased by goldman sachs  was approximately million and was paid in cash on december  the december  asb contains terms substantially identical to the june  asb  requiring certain payments by both us and goldman sachs 
as with the june  asb  the most significant of these payments is the purchase price adjustment with respect to the remaining  shares based principally on goldman sachs actual cost to purchase such shares in the open market  subject to a partial collar  over a period that is expected to extend to late october any payments that we may make under the december  asb can be settled  at our option  in cash or in shares of our common stock
