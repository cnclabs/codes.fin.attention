throughout the following sections  the company refers to st constitution bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiaries  st constitution bank and st constitution capital trust i  the bank refers to st constitution bank  and the trust refers to st constitution capital i 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary the company reported net income for the months ended december  of  an increase of from the  reported for the months ended december  diluted net income per share was in compared to reported in basic net income per share in was as compared to the reported in the company has achieved a five year compounded growth rate for net income of over the period 
all share information has been restated for the effect of a stock dividend declared on december  and paid on january  to shareholders of record on january  key performance ratios continued to improve in as compared to the prior year 
return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in the company s record earnings for reflect continuing momentum across a broad range of product and service offerings 
increased lending activity  coupled with increases in deposits through branch network expansion and secondary market loan sales volume  fueled both the record earnings and balance sheet growth 
the company s net interest income for was  an increase of from the  reported for the net interest margin for was compared to reported for during  a rising interest rate environment evolved during the latter half of the year and continued throughout the year  resulting in lesser levels of loan prepayments for loans securitizing mortgage backed securities in the company s available for sale and held to maturity portfolios 
as a result  net amortization of premiums expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the federal reserve bank s open market committee fomc held eight meetings in and held eight meetings in beginning with the june  meeting  the fomc increased short term interest rates by basis points and continued with a series of thirteen consecutive basis point increases in each of the subsequent meetings 
the immediate benefit of these interest rate increases to the company s investment security purchases and floating rate assets resulted in an basis point increase in the yield on total interest earning assets for in addition  management s ability to lag the interest rate increases on deposits coupled with a tight discipline in deposit pricing resulted in an increase of basis points in the company s net interest margin for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  management expects the fomc to continue its program of increasing the targeted federal funds rate in early and has continued to structure the company s balance sheet in an asset sensitive position in order to continue to benefit from this rising market rate environment 
during  the company has increased its core deposits base as a result of the branch expansion program undertaken throughout in  the company increased the number of branch offices in its target markets and introduced its products and services to an expanded geographic region 
in january  a new loan production office was opened in fort lee bergen county  new jersey 
during june  new branch offices were opened in jamesburg middlesex county and west windsor mercer county  new jersey 
in august  the perth amboy middlesex county  new jersey branch office was relocated to its new permanent location 
this expansion program resulted in significant incremental non interest expenses as a result of branch leases  facilities maintenance  and personnel staffing 
non interest expense increased by  or  to  in from  in management believes the company will continue to realize strategic benefits of this network expansion through increased deposits and new customer relationships 
driven by construction loan growth  the bank s loan portfolio increased in from at december   total loans outstanding including loans held for sale reached  compared to  at december  asset quality remained strong in  as illustrated by the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans of in and in the allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans  covering over of the balance of total nonperforming loans 
the bank s deposit base increased by in from  at december  to  at december  management strategically priced deposit products to be competitive with other financial institutions with branch locations in its market yet still maintain a strong net interest margin to support earnings growth 
management believes that the company has positioned itself for continued success with the combination of a strong capital base  a commitment to provide exceptional customer service  and a commitment to maintain the technology necessary to provide its customers with easy access to the financial products and services offered by the bank 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies 
management believes the company s policy with respect to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could materially impact results of operations 
this critical policy and its application is periodically reviewed with the audit committee and the board of directors 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance  including an assessment of known and inherent risks in the portfolio  giving consideration to the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  level of delinquencies  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  the existence and estimated net realizable value of any underlying collateral and guarantees securing the loans  and current economic and market conditions 
although management uses the best information available to it  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to make additional provisions for loan losses based upon information available to them at the time of their examination 
furthermore  the majority of the company s loans are secured by real estate in the state of new jersey 
accordingly  the collectibility of a substantial portion of the carrying value of the company s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in local market conditions and may be adversely affected should real estate values decline or the central new jersey area experience an adverse economic shock 
future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond the company s control 
results of operations the company reported record earnings of  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  compared to  or per share diluted  in net income and diluted earnings per share grew and  respectively  in the company posted net income of  or per share diluted in all share information ahs been restated for the effect of a stock dividend declared on december  and paid on january  to shareholders of record on january  net interest income net interest income  the company s largest and most significant component of operating income  is the difference between interest and fees earned on loans and other earning assets  and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
this component represented of the company s net revenues in net interest income also depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth the company s consolidated average balances of assets and liabilities and shareholders equity as well as interest income and expense on related items  and the company s average yield or rate for the years ended december   and the average rates are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the average balance of assets and liabilities  respectively

for the purpose of calculating loan yields  average loan balances include nonaccrual loans with no related interest income 
the interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
tax equivalent basis 
changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction between the volume and composition of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  related yields  and associated funding costs 
the rate volume table demonstrates the impact on net interest income of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates earned and paid 
the company s net interest income increased on a tax equivalent basis by  or  to  in  from the  reported in as indicated in the rate volume table  the principal factor contributing to the increase in net interest income was an increase in the interest income of  resulting from increased balances in the loan portfolio components

service charge income increased in principally due to management s actions to restructure service charges and fees based on the results of a comparative study of market fees performed in early during  new fees were assessed on accounts overdrawn for drawing on uncollected funds plus a new fee for processing incoming wire transfers was initiated 
service charge income decreased in as a result of the bank waiving service charges on new accounts during the period of branch expansion  and a decreasing number of accounts subject to service charges 
management continues to utilize a strategy of requiring compensating balances from its commercial customers 
those who meet balance requirements are not assessed service charges 
gain on sale of loans held for sale increased by  or  to  for  from  for gain on sale of loans held for sale totaled  in market interest rates on year fixed rate mortgages fell consistently during  and into the first half of consumer refinance of home loans  which  along with a strong housing market  led to the bank achieving high levels in mortgage origination volumes and mortgage loan sale gains  as newly originated loans were sold at higher than normal spreads due to the consistently lower level of market interest rates 
the rising rate environment that evolved during late and continued throughout has not significantly impacted the mortgage market and resultant secondary loan sales as long term rates have not increased at the same pace as short term rates 
non interest income also includes income from bank owned life insurance boli which amounted to  for compared to  for the bank purchased million in tax free boli assets in and million in  which partially offset the cost of employee benefit plans and reduced the overall effective tax rate 
the bank also generates non interest income from a variety of fee based services 
these include safe deposit rentals  wire transfer service fees and automated teller machine fees for non customers 
deposit and service fee charges are reviewed and adjusted as needed from time to time by management to reflect current costs incurred by the bank to offer the products or services and prices charged by competitor financial institutions amid the bank s competitive market 
the company recorded net losses on sales of securities available for sale of  in versus net gains on sales of  in these portfolio transactions in and were primarily the result of modest portfolio restructurings

regulatory  professional and other fees increased by  or  to  in compared to  in as the company incurred increased legal  independent accountant and consultant fees primarily as a result of new compliance requirements contained in section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the bank s ratio of non interest expense to average assets was for compared to for and for an important industry productivity measure is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total operating expenses by net interest income and other income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income  while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources 
the bank s efficiency ratio increased modestly in to compared to in and in financial condition cash and cash equivalents at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to  at december  cash and cash equivalents at december  consisted of cash and due from banks of  and federal funds sold short term investments of  the corresponding balances at december  were  and  respectively

the average yield earned on the portfolio was in  an increase of basis points from earned in securities available for sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for other business purposes 
securities available for sale consist primarily of us government and federal agency securities as well as mortgage backed securities 
activity in this portfolio is undertaken primarily to manage liquidity and interest rate risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create economically more attractive returns

loans the loan portfolio  which represents the bank s largest asset  is a significant source of both interest and fee income 
elements of the loan portfolio are subject to differing levels of credit and interest rate risk 
the bank s primary lending focus continues to be construction loans  commercial loans  owner occupied commercial mortgage loans and tenanted commercial real estate loans 
total loans averaged  during  an increase of  or  compared to an average of  in growth in the average loan portfolio balance was generated primarily by an increase of  or  in commercial mortgage and construction wholesale loans 
at december   total loans amounted to  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the average yield earned on the loan portfolio was in compared to in  an increase of basis points 
this increase is primarily due to the rising interest rate environment that evolved during the last half of and continued throughout the following table represents the components of the loan portfolio for the dates indicated 
december  amount amount amount amount amount construction loans residential real estate loans commercial and commercial real estate loans loans to individuals lease financing all other loans total the rising interest rate environment that existed throughout  especially the rising average prime rate  and competitive loan pricing resulted in the increased portfolio components discussed in the following paragraphs 
commercial loans averaged  for  an increase of  or  compared to  for commercial loans consist primarily of loans to small and middle market businesses and are typically working capital loans used to finance inventory  receivables or equipment needs 
these loans are generally secured by business assets of the commercial borrower 
the average yield on the commercial loan portfolio decreased basis points to in from in commercial mortgages and construction wholesale loans averaged  for  an increase of  or  compared to  for generally  these loans represent owner occupied or investment properties and usually complement a broader commercial relationship between the bank and the borrower 
construction loans are structured to provide for advances only after work is completed and inspected by qualified professionals 
the average yield on the commercial mortgages and construction wholesale loan portfolio increased basis points to for from for residential mortgages and construction retail loans averaged  for  a decrease of  or  compared to  for these loans consist primarily of residential mortgage loans  home equity loans and business loans secured by residential real estate 
the average yield on this portfolio increased basis points to for from for the following table provides information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s commercial and commercial real estate loans and construction loans at december  maturity range type within one year after one but within five years after five years total commercial commercial real estate construction loans total fixed rate loans floating rate loans total non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non performing loans are composed of loans on a non accrual basis  loans which are contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal payments but have not been classified as non accrual  and loans whose terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest on principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the bank s policy with regard to non accrual loans is that generally  loans are placed on a non accrual status when they are days past due unless these loans are well secured and in the process of collection or  regardless of the past due status of the loan  when management determines that the complete recovery of principal or interest is in doubt 
consumer loans are generally charged off after they become days past due 
subsequent payments on loans in non accrual status are credited to income only if collection of principal is not in doubt 
non performing loans decreased by  or  to  at december   from  at december  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease of  in non accrual loans to  at december  compared to  at december  management believes that the borrowing relationships representing the balance of non performing loans at december  are well collateralized and present minor risk of financial loss to the company 
the table below sets forth non performing assets and risk elements in the bank s portfolio by type for the years indicated 
as the table demonstrates  loan quality and ratios remain strong 
this was accomplished through quality loan underwriting  a proactive approach to loan monitoring and aggressive workout strategies 
non performing assets decreased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  non performing assets represented of total assets at december  and at december  non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   compared to at december  the bank had no loans classified as restructured loans or potential problem loans at december  and at december   the bank had in loans that were days or more past due but still accruing interest income compared to  of loans in this category of non performing loans at december  management s decision to accrue income on these loans was based on the level of collateral and the status of collection efforts 
non performing assets and loans non performing loans loans days or more past due and still accruing non accrual loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total assets management takes a proactive approach in addressing delinquent loans 
the company s president meets weekly with all loan officers to review the status of credits past due ten days or more 
an action plan is discussed for each of the loans to determine the steps necessary to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
also  delinquency notices are system generated when loans are five days past due and again at fifteen days past due 
in most cases  the company s collateral is real estate and when the collateral is foreclosed upon  the real estate is carried at the lower of fair market value less estimated selling costs  or at cost 
the amount  if any  by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the fair market value of the asset is a loss which is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure or repossession 
resolution of a past due loan can be delayed if the borrower files a bankruptcy petition because collection action cannot be continued unless the company first obtains relief from the automatic stay provided by the bankruptcy code 
allowance for loan losses and related provision the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve available for losses incurred or inherent in the loan portfolio and other extensions of credit 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the company s primary lending emphasis is the origination of commercial and commercial real estate loans including construction loans 
based on the composition of the loan portfolio  the primary risks inherent in it are deteriorating credit quality  increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  and a decline in new jersey real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect the loan portfolio and may result in increased delinquencies  loan losses and increased future provision levels 
all  or part  of the principal balance of commercial and commercial real estate loans  and construction loans are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all  or part  of the principal balance is highly unlikely 
consumer loans are generally charged off no later than days past due on a contractual basis  earlier in the event of bankruptcy  or if there is an amount deemed uncollectible 
because all identified losses are immediately charged off  no portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is restricted to any individual loan or groups of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan and lease losses 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan and lease losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management s assessment of probable estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses consists of several key elements 
these elements include a specific reserve for doubtful or high risk loans  an allocated reserve  and an unallocated portion 
the company consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology 
during the quarterly review of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the company considers a variety of factors that include general economic conditions 
trends in charge offs 
trends and levels of delinquent loans 
trends and levels of non performing loans  including loans over days delinquent 
trends in volume and terms of loans 
levels of allowance for specific classified loans 
credit concentrations 
the specific reserve for high risk loans is established for specific commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  and construction loans which have been identified by management as being high risk loan assets 
these high risk loans are assigned a doubtful risk rating grade because the loan has not performed according to payment terms and there is reason to believe that repayment of the loan principal in whole  or part  is unlikely 
the specific portion of the allowance is the total amount of potential unconfirmed losses for these individual doubtful loans 
to assist in determining the fair value of loan collateral  the company often utilizes independent third party qualified appraisal firms which in turn employ their own criteria and assumptions that may include occupancy rates  rental rates  and property expenses  among others 
the second category of reserves consists of the allocated portion of the allowance 
the allocated portion of the allowance is determined by taking pools of loans outstanding that have similar characteristics and applying historical loss experience for each pool 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
individual loan pools are created for commercial and commercial real estate loans  construction loans  and for the various types of loans to individuals 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for current conditions  current loan portfolio performance  loan policy or management changes  or any other factor which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
the company also maintains an unallocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable 
it is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed  these estimates by definition lack precision 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which is often subjective and changing rapidly 
at december   management believed that the allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans was adequate 
the table below presents  for the years indicated  an analysis of the allowance for loan losses and other related data

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was at december   compared to at december  management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains strong and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate in relation to credit risk exposure levels 
the provision for loan losses was  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and management considers a complete review of the following specific factors in determining the provision for loan losses historical losses by loan category  non accrual loans  problem loans as identified through internal classifications  collateral values  and the growth and size of the portfolio 
in addition to these factors  management takes into consideration current economic conditions and local real estate market conditions 
the increase in the provision for the year ended december  was primarily due growth of the loan portfolio and increased watch list loans 
management believes the quality of the loan portfolio remains sound  the determination of the provision for loan losses amount was primarily due to the manageable balances in non accrual loans and management s assessment of economic conditions in the bank s marketplace 
net charge offs recoveries amounted to a net charge off of  in compared to a net charge off of  in the following table describes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various categories of loans and certain other information as of the dates indicated

liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
liquidity management refers to the company s ability to support asset growth while satisfying the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers 
in addition to maintaining liquid assets  factors such as capital position  profitability  asset quality and availability of funding affect a bank s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  investment securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
additional asset based liquidity is derived from scheduled loan repayments as well as investment repayments of principal and interest from mortgage backed securities 
on the liability side  the primary source of liquidity is the ability to generate core deposits 
short term borrowings are used as supplemental funding sources when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earnings assets 
the bank has established a borrowing relationship with the fhlb and its correspondent banks which further supports and enhances liquidity 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
at december   the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  net cash provided by operating activities decreased by  or  to  for from  for the primary source of funds is net income from operations adjusted for provision for loan losses  depreciation expenses  and net amortization of premiums on securities

net cash used in investing activities decreased by  or  to  for from  for the decrease in cash usage for compared to resulted from decreases in loans and purchases of securities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by  or  to  for from  for the cash provided in resulted primarily from the increase in total deposits 
the securities portfolios are also a source of liquidity  providing cash flows from maturities and periodic repayments of principal 
during  prepayments and maturities of investment securities totaled  another source of liquidity is the loan portfolio  which provides a flow of payments and maturities 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the largest component of the bank s total income is net interest income  and the majority of the bank s financial instruments are composed of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities with various terms and maturities 
the primary objective of management is to maximize net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is derived from timing differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities  loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  and differences in lending and funding rates 
management actively seeks to monitor and control the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the bank s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity or repricing and the fair value of such instruments at december  interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  total within one year one year to two years non interest sensitive and over two years total in thousands interest sensitivity period day day day day earning assets total investment securities loans other interest earning assets source of funds savings and time deposits other interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing sources asset liability sensitivity gap period gap cumulative gap cumulative gap to total assets the bank continually evaluates interest rate risk management opportunities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
management believes that hedging instruments currently available are not cost effective  and therefore has focused its efforts on increasing the bank s spread by attracting lower costing retail deposits 
in addition to utilizing the gap ratio for interest rate risk assessment  management utilizes simulation analysis whereby the model estimates the variance in net income with a change in interest rates of plus or minus basis points over and month periods 
given recent simulations  net interest income would be within policy guidelines regardless of the direction of market rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis to measure the impacts of longer term asset and liability mismatches beyond two years  the company utilizes modified duration of equity and economic value of portfolio equity evpe models 
the modified duration of equity measures the potential price risk of equity to changes in interest rates 
a longer modified duration of equity indicates a greater degree of risk to rising interest rates 
because of balance sheet optionality  an evpe analysis is also used to dynamically model the present value of asset and liability cash flows  with rates ranging up or down basis points 
the economic value of equity is likely to be different as interest rates change 
results falling outside prescribed ranges require action by management 
at december  and  the company s variance in the economic value equity as a percentage of assets with an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift of basis points is within the negative guideline  as shown in the tables below 
the market capitalization of the company should not be equated to the evpe  which only deals with the valuation of balance sheet cash flows using conservative assumptions 
calculated core deposit premiums may be less than what is available in an outright sale 
the model does not consider potential premiums on floating rate loan sales  the impact of overhead expense  non interest income  taxes  industry market price multiples and other factors reflected in the market capitalization of a company
