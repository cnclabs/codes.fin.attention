we manage our business as three separate segments  an exploration and production segment  a marketing segment and a service operations segment which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling subsidiary 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary chesapeake is the second largest independent producer of natural gas in the united states and we own interests in approximately  producing oil and gas wells 
our strategy is focused on discovering  developing and acquiring onshore natural gas reserves primarily in the southwestern us and secondarily in the appalachian basin in the eastern us our most important operating area has historically been the mid continent region  which includes oklahoma  arkansas  kansas and the texas panhandle 
at december   of our proved reserves were located in the mid continent 
during the past four years  we have also built significant positions in the south texas and texas gulf coast regions  the permian basin of west texas and eastern new mexico  the barnett shale area of north central texas  the ark la tex area of east texas and northern louisiana and the emerging fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
as a result of our recent acquisition of columbia energy resources  llc and its subsidiaries  including columbia natural resources  llc cnr as described below  we now have a significant presence in the appalachian basin  principally in west virginia  eastern kentucky  eastern ohio and southern new york 
chesapeake attributes its strong organic growth rates during and in the past five years to management s early recognition that oil and gas prices were undergoing structural change and its subsequent decision to invest aggressively in the building blocks of value creation in the e p industry people  land and seismic 
during the past five years  chesapeake has invested more than billion in new leasehold and d seismic acquisitions and now owns what it believes to be the largest inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us on this leasehold  the company has identified more than a year drilling inventory of approximately  drilling locations 
in addition  chesapeake has significantly strengthened its technical capabilities during the past five years by increasing its land  geoscience and engineering staff by to over employees 
today  the company has more than  employees  of which approximately work in the company s e p operations and work in the company s oilfield service operations 
oil and natural gas production for was bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or over the bcfe produced in we have increased our production for consecutive years and consecutive quarters 
during these quarters  chesapeake s us production has increased for an average compound quarterly growth rate of and an average compound annual growth rate of 
in addition to increased oil and natural gas production  the prices we received were higher in than in on a natural gas equivalent basis  weighted average prices excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in the increase in prices resulted in an increase in revenue of million  and increased production resulted in an increase in revenue of million  for a total increase in revenue of billion excluding the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
in each of the operating areas where chesapeake sells its oil and natural gas  established marketing and transportation infrastructures exist thereby contributing to relatively high wellhead price realizations for our production 

table of contents during  chesapeake drilled net operated wells and participated in another  net wells operated by other companies 
the company s drilling success rate was for company operated wells and for non operated wells 
during  chesapeake invested billion in operated wells using an average of operated rigs  million in non operated wells using an average of approximately non operated rigs and million in acquiring new d seismic data and new leasehold excluding leasehold acquired through acquisitions 
our acquisition expenditures totaled billion during including amounts paid for unproved leasehold and excluding million of deferred taxes in connection with certain corporate acquisitions 
we expect to continue replacing reserves through the drillbit and acquisitions  although the timing and magnitude of future additions are uncertain 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended the year with tcfe  an increase of tcfe  or 
during  we replaced bcfe of production with an estimated tcfe of new proved reserves  for a reserve replacement rate of 
this compares to reserve replacement of and for and  respectively 
reserve replacement through the drillbit was tcfe  or of production including a positive bcfe from performance revisions and a positive bcfe from oil and natural gas price increases  or of the total increase 
reserve replacement through acquisitions was tcfe  or of production  or of the total increase 
our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be from to  from to  from to  from to and from to our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately in  in and in based on our current drilling schedule and budget  we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in will begin producing within the next five years 
generally  proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within a year 
on november   we acquired cnr and its significant natural gas reserves  acreage and mid stream assets for approximately billion  of which billion was in cash and billion was in assumed liabilities related to cnr s working capital deficit and its prepaid sales agreement and hedging positions 
the cnr assets consist of mmcfe per day of natural gas production  tcfe of proved reserves and approximately million net acres of us oil and gas leasehold  which we estimate have over  additional undrilled locations with reserve potential 
cnr also owns extensive mid stream natural gas assets  including over  miles of natural gas gathering lines 
in anticipation of today s tight drilling rig market  chesapeake began making a series of investments in drilling rigs in in that year  chesapeake formed its owned drilling rig subsidiary  nomac drilling corporation  with an investment of million to build and refurbish five drilling rigs 
chesapeake has invested a total of million in nomac s operating rigs  invested another million in rigs that nomac is currently building  and budgeted an additional million for completion of these rigs 
in addition to nomac  chesapeake has also made four other major drilling rig investments 
the first of these was its ownership of approximately of the common stock of pioneer drilling company pioneer  which we began acquiring in the company recently sold its pioneer stock  realizing proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million that it will recognize in the first quarter 
chesapeake re invested the pioneer proceeds to acquire rigs from privately held martex drilling company  llp for million 
chesapeake has invested million in two private drilling rig contractors  dhs drilling company and mountain drilling company  in which chesapeake owns and  respectively 
dhs owns ten drilling rigs and has three more rigs on order 
mountain owns one drilling rig and has ordered another nine rigs for delivery in and chesapeake s drilling rig investments have served as a partial hedge to rising service costs and have also provided competitive advantages in making acquisitions and in developing its own leasehold on a more timely basis 
as of december   the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity was compared to as of december  during  we 
table of contents received net proceeds of billion through issuances of billion of preferred equity  billion of common equity  and billion principal amount of senior notes 
we issued million shares of common stock in exchange for outstanding shares of our and series preferred stock and upon conversions of our preferred stock 
additionally  we purchased and retired million principal amount of outstanding senior notes during as a result of our debt transactions during  we have extended the average maturity of our long term debt to over years and have lowered our average interest rate to approximately we intend to continue to focus on improving the strength of our balance sheet 
we believe our business strategy and operational performance will lead to an investment grade credit rating for our unsecured debt in the future 
our president and chief operating officer  tom l 
ward  resigned as a director  officer and employee of the company effective february  the resignation agreement provides for the immediate vesting of all of mr 
ward s unvested stock options and restricted stock on february  as a result of such vesting  options to purchase  shares of chesapeake s common stock at an average exercise price of per share and  shares of restricted common stock became immediately vested 
as a result  the company expects to incur a non cash after tax charge of approximately million in the first quarter liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and uses of funds our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for certain acquisitions is cash flow from operations 
based on our current production  price and expense assumptions  we expect cash flow from operations will exceed our drilling capital expenditures in our budget for drilling  land and seismic activities during is currently between billion and billion 
we believe this level of exploration and development will be sufficient to increase our reserves in and achieve our goal of a to increase in production over production inclusive of acquisitions completed or scheduled to close in through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 
however  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
any cash flow from operations not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions  dividends  debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and million in the million increase from to and the million increase from to were primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and gas production 
we expect that production volumes will be higher than in and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
while a precipitous decline in gas prices in would affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations  we have of our expected oil production in hedged at an average nymex price of per barrel of oil and excluding the hedges assumed in the cnr acquisition and certain collars and options of our expected natural gas production in hedged at an average nymex price of per mcf 
this level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a substantial portion of our production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  however  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
based on fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  our hedging counterparties may require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance from time to time 
at december  and march   we had million of letters of credit securing our performance of hedging contracts 
to mitigate the liquidity impact of those collateral requirements  we have negotiated caps on the amount of collateral that we might be required to post with seven of our counterparties 
all of our existing commodity hedges that are not under our 
table of contents secured hedge facilities described below under contractual obligations are with these counterparties and the maximum amount of collateral that we would be required to post with them is no more than million in the aggregate 
a significant source of liquidity is our billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in february at march   there was billion of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility 
we use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed 
we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  we borrowed billion and repaid billion in and we borrowed and repaid million in under our bank credit facility 
we incurred million  million and million of financing costs related to our revolving bank credit facility in  and  respectively  as a result of amendments to the credit facility agreement 
also during  we repaid the remaining credit facility balance of million assumed in the cnr acquisition 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our revolving bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  our short term contractual obligations and dividend payments at current levels for the foreseeable future 
the public and institutional markets have been our principal source of long term financing for acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
nevertheless  we caution that ready access to capital on reasonable terms and the availability of desirable acquisition targets at attractive prices are subject to many uncertainties  as explained under risk factors in item a

this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities

contractual obligations we currently have a billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility which matures in february the credit facility was increased from billion to billion in february as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized million of the facility for various letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and natural gas properties and bear interest at either i the greater of the reference rate of union bank of california  na  or the federal funds effective rate plus or ii london interbank offered rate libor  at our option  plus a margin that varies from to according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee that also varies from to according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
currently the annual commitment fee is 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  purchase or redeem our capital stock  make investments or loans  and create liens 
the credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio as defined not to exceed to and an indebtedness to ebitda ratio as defined not to exceed to at december   our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was to and our indebtedness to ebitda ratio was to if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million million in the case of our senior notes issued after  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations exceed certain levels 
as of december   we were required to post million of collateral in the form of 
table of contents letters of credit with respect to such derivative transactions 
these collateral requirements were million as of march  future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
we currently have arrangements with five of our counterparties  with which we have outstanding transactions  that limit the amount of collateral that we would be required to post with them to no more than million in the aggregate 
we have two secured hedging facilities  each of which permits us to enter into cash settled natural gas and oil commodity transactions  valued by the counterparty  for up to million 
the scheduled maturity date for these facilities is may outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our oil and natural gas properties that do not secure any of our other obligations 
one of the hedging facilities is subject to an annual fee of of the maximum total capacity and each of them has a exposure fee  which is assessed quarterly on the average of the daily negative fair market value amounts  if any  during the quarter 
as of december   the fair market value of the natural gas and oil hedging transactions was a liability of million under one of the facilities and a liability of million under the other facility 
as of march   the fair market value of the same transactions was an asset of approximately million and million  respectively 
the hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements 
the agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate gas and oil production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time 
two of our subsidiaries  chesapeake exploration limited partnership and chesapeake appalachia  llc  are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and chesapeake exploration limited partnership is the named party to our hedging facilities 
the facilities are guaranteed by chesapeake and all its other wholly owned domestic subsidiaries 
our revolving bank credit facility and secured hedge facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants 
although the applicable interest rates and commitment fees in our bank credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  the bank facility and the secured hedge facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings 
in addition to outstanding revolving bank credit facility borrowings discussed above  as of december   senior notes represented approximately billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following in thousands senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due contingent convertible senior notes due discount on senior notes discount for interest rate derivatives no scheduled principal payments are required on any of the senior notes until  when million is due

our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness

the debt incurrence covenants do not presently restrict our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility

hedging activities oil and gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at every board meeting 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps  call options and collars 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and gas production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our hedging contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or loss 
commodity markets are volatile  and chesapeake s hedging activity is dynamic 
mark to market positions under oil and gas hedging contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described above under contractual obligations  we may be required to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance if our payment obligations to our hedging counterparties exceed levels stated in our contracts

table of contents natural gas production represented approximately of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in  compared to in and in oil and gas marketing sales 
chesapeake realized billion in oil and gas marketing sales to third parties in  with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of billion  for a net margin of million 
marketing activities are substantially for third parties who are owners in chesapeake operated wells 
this compares to sales of million and million  expenses of million and million  and margins of million and million in and  respectively 
in and  chesapeake realized an increase in volumes and prices related to oil and gas marketing sales as compared to the previous year 
production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher third party field service costs  energy costs and personnel costs 
we expect that production expenses per mcfe produced for will range from to 
production taxes 
production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in both and the million increase in production taxes in is due primarily to approximately bcfe of increased production and the increase of per mcfe in sales price excluding gains or losses on derivatives 
included in is a credit of million  or per mcfe  related to certain oklahoma severance tax abatements for the period july through december in april  the oklahoma tax commission concluded that a pre determined oil and gas price cap for sales had not been exceeded on a statewide basis and notified the company that it was eligible to receive certain severance tax abatements for the period from july  through june  the company had previously estimated that the average oil and gas sales prices in oklahoma on a statewide basis could exceed the price cap  and did not reflect the benefit from these potential severance tax abatements until the first quarter of in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher 
we expect production taxes per mcfe to range from to during based on nymex prices of per barrel of oil and natural gas wellhead prices ranging from to per mcfe produced 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses were  and per mcfe for  and  respectively 
the increase in and was the result of the company s overall growth 
this growth has resulted in a substantial increase in employees and related costs 
included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of million in  million in and million in during  million shares of restricted stock  net of forfeitures  were granted to employees 
the cost of all outstanding restricted shares is amortized over a four year period which resulted in the recognition of million of stock based compensation costs during of this amount  million was reflected in general and administrative expense  and the remaining million was capitalized to oil and gas properties 
chesapeake did not issue restricted stock awards prior to additionally  we recognized million  million and million in stock based compensation expense in  and  respectively  as a result of modifications made to previously issued stock options 
of the million recognized in  million was capitalized to oil and gas properties 
stock based compensation was per mcfe for and per mcfe for we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe produced including stock based compensation ranging from and per mcfe produced 

table of contents chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs excluding stock based compensation in  and  respectively  directly related to our oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development efforts 
provision for legal settlements 
in  we recorded a provision for legal settlement of million related to various litigation incidental to our business operations 
in  we recorded a million provision related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit with certain oklahoma royalty owners 
oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the average rate from in to in is primarily the result of higher drilling costs  higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe produced 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in and was primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of various gathering facilities  compression equipment  construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and the purchase of additional information technology equipment and software in and property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over to years  gathering facilities are depreciated over seven to years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to seven years 
to the extent drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs 
we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe produced 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income consisted of million of interest income  million of income related to equity investments  and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income  million of income related to earnings on investments  and million of miscellaneous income 
the income consisted of million of interest income  a million loss related to an equity investment  a million gain on the final settlement of the sale of our canadian subsidiary and million of miscellaneous income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million in and million in as follows years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes and revolving bank credit facility capitalized interest amortization of loan discount unrealized gain loss on interest rate derivatives realized gain on interest rate derivatives total interest expense average long term borrowings 
table of contents we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities and the debt s carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative 
any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense 
a detailed explanation of our interest rate derivative activity appears below in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest expense  excluding unrealized gains losses on derivatives and net of amounts capitalized  was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and per mcfe in we expect interest expense for to be between and per mcfe produced before considering the effect of interest rate derivatives 
loss on investment in seven seas 
in  we reduced the carrying value of our investment in securities of seven seas petroleum inc to zero by recording an impairment of million 
we recovered approximately million on this investment in and recorded an impairment of million in loss on repurchases or exchanges of debt 
during the past three years we have repurchased or exchanged chesapeake debt and incurred losses in connection with these transactions 
we entered into these transactions in order to re finance a portion of our long term debt at a lower rate of interest 
the following table shows the losses related to these transactions for  and  respectively in millions notes retired loss on repurchases exchanges for the year ended december  premium other a total senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due for the year ended december  senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due for the year ended december  senior notes due b a includes write offs of discounts  deferred charges and interest rate derivatives associated with notes retired and transaction costs 
b includes a million loss that was recognized based on the hedging relationship between the notes and an associated interest rate derivative 
income tax expense 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in compared to income tax expense of million in and million in our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in the increase in reflected the impact state income taxes and permanent differences had on our overall effective rate 
our effective income tax rate will increase to in to reflect our current assessment of expected increases in state income taxes and permanent differences 
during and  we determined that it was more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of the deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses would not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts during those years 
in  we acquired louisiana oil and gas properties which resulted in us determining that it was more likely than not that the 
table of contents million of deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses would be realized 
therefore  the million valuation allowance was reversed at december  as part of the recording of the purchase of these assets 
all income tax expense was deferred  and we expect most  if not all  of our income tax expense to be deferred 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
effective january   chesapeake adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligation 
upon adoption of sfas in  we recorded the discounted fair value of our expected future obligations of million  a cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  as an increase to earnings of million net of income taxes and an increase in net oil and gas properties of million 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock was million in compared to million in the loss was the result of private exchanges of million of our cumulative convertible preferred stock for million shares of common stock and private exchanges of million of our series cumulative convertible preferred stock for million shares of common stock 
the loss was the result of a private exchange of million of our cumulative convertible preferred stock for million shares of common stock and a public exchange of million of our cumulative convertible preferred stock for million shares of common stock 
the loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
we also incurred million in transaction costs related to the public exchange 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales  and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and gas sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in oil and gas sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  
table of contents changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of million  an asset of million and a liability of million  respectively 
the derivatives that we acquired in our cnr acquisition represented million of the liability at december  with respect to our derivatives held as of december   an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of per mmbtu would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
an increase or decrease in crude oil prices of per barrel would decrease or increase the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
oil and gas properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is also based on the amount of estimated reserves 
if 
table of contents we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
the two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis 
all reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data we developed 
additional information about our year end reserve evaluation is included under oil and gas reserves in item business 
in addition  the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rates have increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in reflecting the impact of increases in prices and finding costs during these periods 
as of december   a decrease in natural gas prices of per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of per barrel would reduce the company s estimated proved reserves by bcfe and by bcfe  respectively  as a result of economic truncation of the expected producing lives of some properties 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this 
table of contents process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas  accounting for business combinations 
the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 

table of contents we believe that the consideration we have paid for our acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations  nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties as of december   we had accrued accounts receivable from our two co founders  ceo aubrey k 
mcclendon and former coo  tom l 
ward  of million and million  respectively  representing joint interest billings from december which were invoiced and paid in january since chesapeake was founded in  messrs 
mcclendon and ward have acquired small working interests in certain of our oil and gas properties by participating in our drilling activities 
joint interest billings to them are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing 
under the founder well participation program  approved by our shareholders in june  messrs 
mcclendon and ward may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake  but they are not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors days prior to the start of each calendar year 
their participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the founder well participation program  which  among other things  limits their individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of their participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for the cost of its leasehold acquired by messrs 
mcclendon and ward as a result of their well participation 
as a result of the resignation of mr 
ward on february   his participation in the founder well participation program will expire on august   which is also the expiration date of non competition covenants applicable to mr 
ward 
as disclosed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item  in  chesapeake had revenues of million from oil and gas sales to eagle energy partners i  lp  an affiliated entity

recently issued accounting standards the financial accounting standards board recently issued the following standards which were reviewed by chesapeake to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services by requiring a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after june  since the issuance of sfas r  three fasb staff positions fsps have been issued regarding sfas r 
these fsps  fsp fas r classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued in exchange for employee services under fasb statement no 
r  fsp fas r practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r  and fsp fas r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards will be applicable upon the initial adoption of sfas r 
chesapeake will implement sfas r in the first quarter of and the black scholes option pricing model will be used to value the stock options as of the grant date 
based on the stock options outstanding and unvested at december  and our current intention to limit future awards of stock options  we do not believe the new accounting requirement will have a significant impact on future results of operations 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement obligations under the provisions of sfas no 
fin is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after december  we adopted this statement effective december  implementation of fin did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of sfas will depend on the nature and extent of any voluntary accounting changes and correction of errors after the effective date  but we do not currently expect sfas to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
eitf issue confirmed that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds can be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the consensus in this issue should be applied for fiscal years ending after september   and the corresponding information for earlier periods  including interim periods  should be restated unless it is impractical to do so 
the adoption of eitf issue is not expected to have a material impact on our disclosures 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps  basis protection swaps  call options and collars 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
for swap instruments  chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
for cap swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterparty s exposure 
in other words  there is no limit to chesapeake s exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty 
basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for oil or gas from a specified delivery point 
chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for call options  chesapeake receives a cash premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option 
if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  then chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess 
if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from chesapeake 
collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 

table of contents chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap 
under the counter swap  chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty 
the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap 
we refer to this locked in value as a locked swap 
at the time chesapeake enters into a counter swap  chesapeake removes the original swap s designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under sfas the reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
instead  the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and gas prices 
any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and gas sales in the month of related production 
with respect to counter swaps that are designed to lock in the value of cap swaps  the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of the cap swap until the floating price reaches the cap or floor stipulated in the cap swap agreement 
the value of the counter swap will increase or decrease  but in the opposite direction  as the value of the cap swap decreases or increases until the floating price reaches the pre determined cap or floor stipulated in the cap swap agreement 
however  because of the written put option embedded in the cap swap  the changes in value of the cap swap are not completely effective in offsetting changes in value of the corresponding counter swap 
changes in the value of cap swaps and the counter swaps are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas sales 
chesapeake enters into derivatives from time to time for the purpose of converting a fixed price gas sales contract to a floating price 
we refer to these contracts as floating price swaps 
for a floating price swap  chesapeake receives a floating market price from the counterparty and pays a fixed price 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 to the extent that a legal right of setoff exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
chesapeake enters into basis protection swaps for the purpose of locking in a price differential for oil or gas from a specified delivery point 
we currently have basis protection swaps covering four different delivery points which correspond to the actual prices we receive for much of our gas production 
by entering into these basis protection swaps  we have effectively reduced our exposure to market changes in future gas price differentials 
as of december   the fair value of our basis protection swaps was million 
currently  our basis protection swaps cover approximately of our anticipated gas production remaining in  in  in  and in gains or losses from derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and gas sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses included in oil and gas sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
pursuant to sfas  certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and gas sales 
unrealized gains losses included in oil and gas sales were million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
following provisions of sfas  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and gas sales as unrealized gains losses 
we recorded a gain loss on ineffectiveness of million  million and million in  and  respectively

the actual contribution to our future results of operations will be based on the market prices at the time of settlement and may be more or less than the fair value estimates used at december  based upon the market prices at december   we expect to transfer approximately million net of income taxes of the loss included in the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings during the next months when the transactions actually occur 
all transactions hedged as of december  are expected to mature by december  
table of contents additional information concerning changes in the fair value of our oil and gas derivative instruments is as follows december  in thousands fair value of contracts outstanding  as of january change in fair value of contracts during the period contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period fair value of new contracts when entered into during the period fair value of contracts when closed during the period fair value of contracts outstanding  as of december the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments since january  resulted mainly from an increase in oil and natural gas prices 
derivative instruments reflected as current in the consolidated balance sheet represent the estimated fair value of derivative instrument settlements scheduled to occur over the subsequent twelve month period based on market prices for oil and gas as of the consolidated balance sheet date 
the derivative settlement amounts are not due and payable until the month in which the related underlying hedged transaction occurs 
we assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with the cnr acquisition 
in accordance with sfas  these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of million 
the recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which is allocated to the assets acquired 
because of this accounting treatment  only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed will result in adjustments to our oil and gas revenues upon settlement 
for example  if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed do not change then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions  cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and gas revenues related to the derivative positions 
if  however  the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation  the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and gas revenues  depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower  respectively  than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation 
for accounting purposes  the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we have hedged the production volumes listed below market prices on the date of our acquisition of cnr 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of sfas on derivative instruments and hedging activities  the derivative instruments assumed in connection with the cnr acquisition are deemed to contain a significant financing element and all cash flows associated with these positions will be reported as financing activity in the statement of cash flows for the periods in which settlement occurs

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and therefore does not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our debt 
interest rate derivatives we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to the volatility in interest rates 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets liabilities and the debt s carrying value amount is adjusted by the change in the fair value of the debt subsequent to the initiation of the derivative 
any resulting differences are recorded currently as ineffectiveness in the consolidated statements of operations as an adjustment to interest expense 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded currently as adjustments to interest expense
