item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
business strategy and overview our strategy is to create a value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a low cost structure  iii effective management information systems and iv outstanding employees focused on business excellence in a global market  that can provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 
our goals are focused on i operating our facilities in a safe  reliable  and environmentally responsible way  ii improving profitability by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies  and iii using excess cash flows from operations in a balanced way to create further shareholder value 
in november  our board of directors approved the capital budget  which is currently estimated to be million including refinery turnaround and other maintenance costs of approximately million 
the capital budget includes the modification of our existing fluid coker unit to a delayed coker unit at our california refinery which is designed to i lower emissions as required by the bay area air quality management district see environmental and other and ii increase overall efficiency by lowering operating costs 
we currently expect to spend approximately million through the fourth quarter of for this project  of which million was spent in we anticipate spending million in  million in and the remainder in this cost estimate is subject to further review and analysis 

table of contents our board of directors has approved certain high return and strategic capital projects  including installing a  bpd delayed coker unit at our washington refinery and a  bpd diesel desulfurizer unit at our alaska refinery 
the delayed coker unit will allow our washington refinery to process a larger proportion of lower cost heavy crude oils and manufacture a larger percentage of higher value products 
we expect to spend approximately million through the fourth quarter of for this project  of which we spent million in we anticipate spending million in and the remainder in the diesel desulfurizer unit  which will allow us to manufacture additional quantities of low sulfur diesel at our alaska refinery  will require us to spend approximately million through the second quarter  of which we spent million in we anticipate spending million in and the remainder in these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
in  tesoro s incentive compensation program included two financial goals focused on improving profitability by achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies i achieve earnings of at least per diluted share for executives and per diluted share for all other eligible employees and ii realize million of operating income improvements through business improvement initiatives that are principally generated by intellectual capital rather than capital investment 
during  we achieved the following significant results relative to our goals  which are further described below under results of operations and capital resources liquidity we had record net earnings of million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
we achieved record throughput of  bpd and operating income of billion  which includes the realization of approximately million of operating income through business improvement initiatives 
the majority of the improvements were the result of the diversification of our crude oil purchases  together with yield improvements 
we used cash flows from operations to prepay debt totaling million 
our debt to capitalization ratio was reduced to at year end  compared to at the end of in november we refinanced nearly billion of debt 
we replaced million of our secured debt with unsecured debt  reduced our interest rates and extended the maturity dates 
the refinancing and prepayments of debt during will result in annual pretax interest savings of approximately million 
we initiated a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of per share which was paid in both june and september 
we then doubled the quarterly cash dividend paid in december to per share 
in november  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which represented approximately of the shares then outstanding 
in  we repurchased  shares of common stock for million under the program 
our capital and turnaround spending totaled million of which million was for clean air projects and million was for reliability and safety projects 
industry refining margins remained strong during and improved as compared to factors positively impacting industry refining margins during included continued increased demand due to improved economic fundamentals worldwide  tight finished product inventories and inadequate refining capacity to meet demand growth  third quarter production and supply disruptions on the us gulf coast caused by hurricanes katrina and rita  heavy refining industry turnaround activity in the western us primarily during the first quarter  unplanned refining industry downtime on the us west coast during the third quarter  and 
table of contents the and changes in product specifications related to sulfur reductions in gasoline and the elimination of mtbe 
results of operations summary our net earnings for were million per basic share and per diluted share  compared with net earnings of million per basic share and per diluted share for the significant increase in net earnings during was primarily due to i higher refined product margins  ii record high throughput levels  and iii realizing our operating income improvement initiatives 
net earnings for included charges for debt refinancing and prepayment costs of million after tax or per share  and executive termination and retirement costs of million after tax  or per share 
net earnings for included debt prepayment and financing costs of million after tax  or per share  and charges for executive retirement costs of million after tax  or per share 
our net earnings for were million per basic share and per diluted share  compared with net earnings of million per basic share and per diluted share for the significant increase in net earnings during was primarily due to i higher refined product margins  ii increased throughput levels  iii lower interest expense as a result of debt reduction and refinancing in and additional debt prepayments during  and iv our continued focus on capturing business improvement initiatives 
net earnings for included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million after tax  or per share 
our results also included losses on the sale of our marine services assets and certain retail asset impairments of million after tax  or per share  voluntary early retirement benefits and severance costs of million after tax  or per share  and a charge related to the termination of our funded executive security plan of million after tax  or per share 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance

d management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance  allocate resources and compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin before inventory changes by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations and allocate resources 
manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance 
these financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to segment operating income  revenues  costs of sales and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
e gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks  purchased products  transportation and distribution 
gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel  adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured 
gross refining margin also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market 
f includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately  and for  and  respectively 
g sources of total product sales include products manufactured at the refineries and products purchased from third parties 
total product sales margin includes margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes 
compared to operating income from our refining segment was billion in compared to million in the increase in operating income of million was primarily due to higher gross refining margins  combined with higher throughput levels  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
total gross refining margins increased to per barrel in compared to per barrel in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all our regions 
industry margins on a national basis improved during compared to  primarily due to the continued increased demand for finished products due to improved economic fundamentals worldwide  an active hurricane season and higher than normal industry maintenance particularly in the western united states during the first half of industry margins were also impacted by unplanned industry downtime on the us west coast during the third quarter 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased to billion in from billion in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins and increased total refining throughput 
total refining throughput averaged  bpd in compared to  bpd during  reflecting record high throughput during the third and fourth quarters 
our record high throughput during the last half of reflects improved operational efficiencies resulting from scheduled maintenance turnarounds at our three largest refineries during the first half of we estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by approximately million as a result of both scheduled and unscheduled downtime at our california and washington refineries during the first quarter 
during the third and fourth quarters  our california refinery experienced reduced throughput during a scheduled maintenance turnaround  in which we estimate that our refining operating income was reduced by approximately million 
in addition  our gross refining margins in our pacific northwest region during the first half of and the third and fourth quarters 
table of contents were negatively impacted as the increased differential between light and heavy crude oil depressed the margins for heavy fuel oils 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in from billion in  primarily due to significantly higher average product sales prices combined with slightly higher product sales volumes 
our average product prices increased to per barrel reflecting the continued strength in market fundamentals and the active hurricane season 
total product sales averaged  bpd in  compared to  bpd in our average costs of sales increased to per barrel during  reflecting significantly higher average feedstock prices and increased purchases of refined products due to scheduled and unscheduled downtime at certain refineries 
expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased to million in  compared with million in  primarily due to higher utilities of million  higher employee costs of million  increased maintenance costs of million and increased insurance costs of million primarily due to property insurance premium surcharges resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita 
expenses included the allocation of certain information technology costs totaling million that were previously classified as corporate and unallocated costs 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in  compared to million in  primarily reflecting increasing capital expenditures 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we shortened the estimated lives of the fluid coker unit and certain tanks at our california refinery and recorded asset retirement obligations see note a in our consolidated financial statements in item  resulting in additional depreciation of million 
the existing fluid coker unit will be modified to a delayed coker unit  which is scheduled to be completed during the fourth quarter of the tanks will be retired between and to comply with applicable regulations 
the shortened asset lives and recorded asset retirement obligations will increase depreciation in by approximately million 
refining throughput and yields in will be affected by scheduled maintenance turnarounds at our california  washington  alaska and north dakota refineries 
we currently expect total refining throughput to average approximately  to  bpd in compared to operating income from our refining segment increased to million in compared to million in the million increase in our operating income primarily resulted from significantly higher refined product margins  combined with higher throughput levels and product sales volumes 
our total gross refining margin per barrel increased to per barrel in compared to per barrel in  reflecting higher per barrel refining margins in all of our regions 
industry margins on a national basis improved primarily due to increased demand and below average inventory levels for finished products 
improved economic fundamentals in the us and far east resulted in increased demand and margins for finished products and reduced finished product inventory levels 
heavy refining industry turnaround activity in the padd v region during the first quarter of reduced finished product inventory levels on the us west coast 
furthermore  us west coast gasoline supplies tightened in part due to the elimination of the oxygenate mtbe 
margins were lower in all of our refining regions excluding california for the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter  primarily due to lower seasonal demand for refined products and higher average crude oil prices 
while refining margins in the california region increased during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter  we were unable to fully capture these margins due to scheduled downtime at the california refinery as discussed below 
on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margins increased from billion in to billion in  reflecting higher per barrel gross refining margins in all of our regions and higher total refining throughput volumes 
total refining throughput averaged  bpd in  an increase of  bpd or from  despite scheduled turnarounds at our california refinery  which were completed during the fourth quarter  and unscheduled downtime in the first quarter due to a short term power outage and accelerated maintenance of the hydrogen plant 
primarily due to the scheduled and unscheduled downtime at the california refinery  the percentage of lower cost heavy crude oil that we processed of total refining throughput decreased from in to in in  our alaska  north dakota and utah refineries experienced reduced throughput during scheduled maintenance turnarounds 

table of contents revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in from billion in  primarily due to significantly higher average product sales prices and slightly higher product sales volumes 
our average product prices increased to per barrel and total product sales increased by to average  bpd in from costs of sales also increased primarily due to higher average feedstock prices and slightly higher product sales volumes as compared with expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased maintenance  utilities and employee costs of approximately million and the write off of certain refinery assets that were replaced in connection with the california refinery turnaround of million 
we estimate that the scheduled turnarounds at our california refinery during resulted in additional operating expenses of approximately million in retail segment dollars in millions except per gallon amounts revenues fuel merchandise and other total revenues fuel sales millions of gallons fuel margin gallon a merchandise margin in millions merchandise margin percent of sales average number of stations during the period company operated branded jobber dealer total average retail stations segment operating income loss gross margins fuel b merchandise and other non fuel margin total gross margins expenses operating expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on asset disposals and impairments segment operating income loss a management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
fuel margin per gallon is calculated by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes and may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance 
this financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income and revenues or any other financial measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

operating  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat in  as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in during  we allocated certain information technology costs previously reported as selling  general and administrative expenses to costs of sales and operating expenses totaling million see notes a and d of the condensed consolidated financial statements in item 
the increase during was primarily due to increased employee and contract labor expenses of million  charges for the termination and retirement of certain executive officers of million and additional stock based compensation expenses of million 
the increase in employee and contract labor expenses during primarily reflects costs associated with implementing and supporting systems and process improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in during  we incurred an additional million for stock based and other incentive based compensation  higher professional fees of approximately million for projects related to driving business excellence and charges associated with the retirement of certain executive officers totaling million 
during  we incurred charges totaling million for voluntary early retirement benefits  severance costs and the termination of our funded executive security plan 
interest and financing costs interest and financing costs were million in compared to million in the increase was due to debt refinancing and prepayment costs totaling million associated with the refinancing of our senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes  and charges of million in connection with the voluntary prepayment of our senior secured term loans during during  debt prepayment and financing costs totaled million  primarily associated with voluntary debt prepayments 
excluding these refinancing and prepayment costs  interest and financing costs decreased by million during  primarily due to lower interest expense associated with debt reduction totaling million during and million during 
table of contents interest and financing costs were million in compared to million in the million decrease in was due primarily to lower interest expense associated with debt reduction during and totaling million 
the decrease was also due to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs in in connection with the replacement of our previous credit facility and voluntary prepayments of other debt 
the decrease during was partly offset by debt prepayment and financing costs totaling million as discussed above 
income tax provision the income tax provision amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the increases reflect significantly higher earnings before income taxes 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in our federal and state effective income tax rate during was primarily a result of a new tax deduction for domestic manufacturing activities  which became available in the increase in our federal and state effective income tax rate during was primarily due to a change in california state tax law  which eliminated an investment tax credit that had been available in previous years 
capital resources and liquidity overview we operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products  availability of trade credit  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  worldwide geo political conditions and overall market and economic conditions 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our credit agreement and other sources of capital  may be affected by these conditions 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  no borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and million in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after million in outstanding letters of credit 
we also have a separate letters of credit agreement of which we had million available after million in outstanding letters of credit as of december  as further described below  in november we refinanced nearly billion principal amount of our outstanding senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes through a million notes offering and prepaid an additional million with cash on hand 
in april  we voluntarily prepaid the remaining million outstanding principal balance of our senior secured term loans 
the refinancing and debt prepayments will result in annual pretax interest savings of approximately million 
since may  including the debt prepayments during  we have reduced debt by approximately billion  decreasing our debt to capitalization ratio from at june  to at december  we believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures  working capital and debt service requirements 
capitalization on november   tesoro issued million principal amount of senior notes due and million principal amount of senior notes due the notes offering

gross borrowings and repayments under revolving credit lines each amounted to billion during historical ebitda ebitda represents earnings before interest and financing costs  interest income and other  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
we present ebitda because we believe some investors and analysts use ebitda to help analyze our liquidity including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to use cash for other purposes  including capital expenditures 
ebitda is also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance 
ebitda is also used by management for internal analysis and as a component of the fixed charge coverage financial covenant in our credit agreement

the following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of december  in millions contractual obligation thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations capital expenditure obligations projected pension contributions total contractual obligations includes maturities of principal and interest payments  excluding capital lease obligations 
amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments 
represents our future minimum lease commitments for operating leases 
lease commitments for include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year 
represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for the supply of crude oil feedstocks  with remaining terms ranging from two months to months 
prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate with market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices  ranging from per 
table of contents barrel to per barrel  as of december   and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil feedstocks under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which are not included in the table above 
represents primarily long term commitments to purchase services  including chemical supplies and power 
these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements 
we estimated our commitments to purchase power at our california refinery  which has variable pricing provisions  using estimated future market prices 
actual purchases of electricity at our california refinery typically exceed the required minimum volumes 
our commitments also include a final payment of million in related to terminating the deactivated mtbe plant lease at our california refinery and annual payments of million for a lease beginning in the fourth quarter of with an initial term through although we have no minimum required contribution obligation to our pension plan under applicable laws and regulations  we currently project to voluntarily contribute approximately million in  of which we contributed million in february 
amounts are subject to change based on the performance of the assets in the plan  the discount rate used to determine the obligation  and other actuarial assumptions

we are unable to project benefit contributions beyond as of december   we leased our corporate headquarters from a limited partnership in which we owned a limited interest 
in february  the limited partnership sold the building to a third party resulting in a gain to tesoro of million 
we continue to lease our corporate headquarters from the third party with an initial term through with two five year renewal options 
our lease payments and operating costs paid to the partnership totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively  and our future lease commitments are included in operating leases in the table above 
we accounted for our interest in the partnership using the equity method of accounting 
as such  we did not include the partnership s assets  primarily land and buildings  totaling approximately million and debt of approximately million  in our consolidated financial statements 
environmental and other tesoro is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in use for certain emission sources 
environmental liabilities we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our previously owned properties 
at december   our accruals for environmental expenses totaled million 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline and terminal operations and retail service stations 
we believe these accruals are adequate  based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation action 
during  we continued settlement discussions with the california air resources board carb concerning a notice of violation nov we received in october the nov  issued by carb  alleges that tesoro offered eleven batches of gasoline for sale in california that did not meet carb s gasoline exhaust emission limits 
in january  we executed a settlement agreement and release with carb which requires us to pay a civil penalty of  to resolve this matter 
a reserve for the settlement of the nov is included in the million of environmental accruals referenced above 
in  we received two novs from the bay area air quality management district 
the bay area air quality management district alleged we violated certain air quality emission limits as a result of a mechanical 
table of contents failure of one of our boilers at our california refinery in january on january   we entered into a settlement agreement and release with the district and the district attorney of contra costa county  california 
in exchange for the release of allegations based upon certain air quality emission limits and provisions of the california health and safety code  we paid a civil penalty of million 
a reserve for the settlement of the novs is included in the million of environmental accruals referenced above 
we have undertaken an investigation of environmental conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our california refinery 
this investigation is driven by an order from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board that names us as well as two previous owners of the california refinery 
based on our spending in  the remaining cost estimate for the active wastewater units investigation is approximately  a reserve for this matter is included in the million of environmental accruals referenced above 
on october   we received an nov from the epa 
the epa alleges certain modifications made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit at our washington refinery prior to our acquisition of the refinery were made without a permit in violation of the clean air act 
we are investigating the allegations and believe the ultimate resolution of the nov will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
a reserve for the settlement of the nov is included in the million of environmental accruals referenced above 
on february   we received an offer of settlement from the bay area air quality management district 
the district has offered to settle novs issued to tesoro from january to september for  the novs allege violations of various air quality requirements at the california refinery 
a reserve for the settlement of the novs is included in the million of environmental accruals referenced above 
other environmental matters in the ordinary course of business  we become party to or otherwise involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable  and some matters may require years for us to resolve 
as a result  we have not established reserves for these matters 
on the basis of existing information  we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  we cannot provide assurance that an adverse resolution of one or more of the matters described below during a future reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in future periods 
we are a defendant  along with other manufacturing  supply and marketing defendants  in eleven pending cases alleging mtbe contamination in groundwater 
the defendants are being sued for having manufactured mtbe and having manufactured  supplied and distributed gasoline containing mtbe 
the plaintiffs  all in california  are generally water providers  governmental authorities and private well owners alleging  in part  the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees  but we cannot estimate the amount or the likelihood of the ultimate resolution of these matters at this time  and accordingly have not established a reserve for these cases 
we believe we have defenses to these claims and intend to vigorously defend the lawsuits 
soil and groundwater conditions at our california refinery may require substantial expenditures over time 
in connection with our acquisition of the california refinery from ultramar  inc in may  ultramar assigned certain of its rights and obligations that ultramar had acquired from tosco corporation in august of tosco assumed responsibility and contractually indemnified us for up to million for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august of  which are identified prior to august  pre acquisition operations 
based on existing information  we currently estimate that the known environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations are approximately 
table of contents million  including soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery in connection with various projects and including those required by the california regional water quality control board and other government agencies 
if we incur remediation liabilities in excess of the defined environmental liabilities for pre acquisition operations indemnified by tosco  we expect to be reimbursed for such excess liabilities under certain environmental insurance policies 
the policies provide million of coverage in excess of the million indemnity covering the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
because of tosco s indemnification and the environmental insurance policies  we have not established a reserve for these defined environmental liabilities arising out of the pre acquisition operations 
in december  we initiated arbitration proceedings against tosco seeking damages  indemnity and a declaration that tosco is responsible for the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations at our california refinery 
in november  we filed suit in contra costa county superior court against tosco alleging that tosco misrepresented  concealed and failed to disclose certain additional environmental conditions at our california refinery 
the court granted tosco s motion to compel arbitration of our claims for these certain additional environmental conditions 
in the arbitration proceedings we initiated against tosco in december  we are also seeking a determination that tosco is liable for investigation and remediation of these certain additional environmental conditions  the amount of which is currently unknown and therefore a reserve has not been established  and which may not be covered by the million indemnity for the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in response to our arbitration claims  tosco filed counterclaims in the contra costa county superior court action alleging that we are contractually responsible for additional environmental liabilities at our california refinery  including the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in february  the parties agreed to stay the arbitration proceedings to pursue settlement discussions 
in june  the parties agreed in principle to settle their claims  including the defined environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations and certain additional environmental conditions  both discussed above  pending negotiation and execution of a final written settlement agreement 
in the event we are unable to finalize the settlement  we intend to vigorously prosecute our claims against tosco and to oppose tosco s claims against us  although we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail 
environmental capital expenditures epa regulations related to the clean air act require reductions in the sulfur content in gasoline 
to meet the revised gasoline standard  we spent million in our california  washington  hawaii  alaska and north dakota refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the low sulfur gasoline standards 
we currently estimate we will make additional capital improvements of approximately million at our utah refinery from through  that will permit the utah refinery to produce gasoline meeting the sulfur limits imposed by the epa 
epa regulations related to the clean air act also require reductions in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new on road diesel fuel standards will become effective on june  in may  the epa issued a rule regarding the sulfur content of non road diesel fuel 
the requirements to reduce non road diesel sulfur content will become effective in phases between and we spent million in to meet the revised diesel fuel standards  and based on our latest engineering estimates  we expect to spend approximately million in additional capital improvements through included in the estimate are capital projects to manufacture additional quantities of low sulfur diesel at our alaska refinery  for which we expect to spend approximately million through these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
our california  washington and north dakota refineries will not require additional capital spending to meet the new non road diesel fuel standards

in november  the consent decree was entered by the district court for the western district of texas in which we agreed to undertake projects at our california refinery to reduce air emissions 
we spent million in  and we currently estimate we will make additional capital improvements of approximately million through to satisfy the requirements of the consent decree 
this cost estimate is subject to further review and analysis

bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the owner of these refineries  tesoro is required to address issues that include leak detection and repair  flaring protection  and sulfur recovery unit optimization 
we currently estimate we will spend million over the next three years to comply with this consent decree 
we also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree

claims against third parties beginning in the early s  tesoro hawaii corporation  tesoro alaska company and other fuel suppliers entered into a series of long term  fixed price fuel supply contracts with the us defense energy support center desc 
each of the contracts contained a provision for price adjustments by the desc 
the federal acquisition regulations control how prices may be adjusted  and we and many other suppliers have filed in separate suits in the court of federal claims contesting the desc s price adjustments prior to we and the other suppliers seek recovery of approximately billion in underpayment for fuel 
our share of that underpayment totals approximately million  plus interest 
we alleged that the desc s price adjustments violated federal regulations by not adjusting the sales price of fuel based on changes to each supplier s established prices or costs  as the court of federal claims had held in prior rulings on similar contracts 
the court of federal claims granted partial summary judgment in our favor on that issue  but the court of appeals for the federal circuit has reversed and ruled that desc s prices did not need to be tied to changes in a specific supplier s prices or costs 
we have also asserted other grounds to challenge the desc contract pricing formulas  and we are evaluating our position with respect to further litigation on those additional grounds 
we cannot predict the outcome of these further actions 

table of contents in  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
our protest asserted that the taps intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced 
the regulatory commission of alaska rca considered our protest of the intrastate rates for the years through the rca set just and reasonable final rates for the years through  and held that we are entitled to receive approximately million in refunds  including interest through the expected conclusion of appeals in december the rca s ruling is currently on appeal in the alaska courts  and we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in the appeal 
in  the rca rejected the taps carriers proposed intrastate rate increases for and maintained the permanent rate of to the valdez marine terminal 
that ruling is currently on appeal to the alaska superior court  and the taps carriers did not move to prevent the rate decrease 
the rate decrease has been in effect since june if the rca s decision is upheld on appeal  we could be entitled to refunds resulting from our shipments from january through mid june if the rca s decision is not upheld on appeal  we could have to pay additional shipping charges resulting from our shipments from mid june through december we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in the appeal 
we also believe that  should we not prevail on appeal  the amount of additional shipping charges cannot reasonably be estimated since it is not possible to estimate the permanent rate which the rca could set  and the appellate courts approve  for each year 
in addition  depending upon the level of such rates  there is a reasonable possibility that any refunds for the period january through mid june could offset some or all of any repayments due for the period mid june through december in july  the taps carriers filed a proceeding at the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  seeking to have the ferc assume jurisdiction over future rates for intrastate transportation on taps 
we have filed a protest in that proceeding  which has now been consolidated with another ferc proceeding seeking to set just and reasonable rates for future interstate transportation on taps 
if the taps carriers should prevail  then the rates charged for all shipments of alaska north slope crude oil on taps could be revised by the ferc  but any ferc changes to rates for intrastate transportation of crude oil supplies for our alaska refinery should be prospective only and should not affect prior intrastate rates  refunds or repayments
