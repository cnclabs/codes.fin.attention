item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of monarch 
the discussion and analysis does not include any comments relating to monarch community bancorp since monarch community bancorp has no significant operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
monarch s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans  investments  and overnight deposits  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings 
monarch s results of operations also are significantly affected by the level of its gains from sales of mortgage loans 
critical accounting policies as described under regulation and supervision  the financial services industry is highly regulated 
other than described below  management does not believe the use of estimates and management judgment is likely to present a material risk to the financial statements 
in cases where estimates or management judgment are required  internal controls and processes are established to provide assurance that such estimates and management judgments are materially correct to the best of management s knowledge 
allowance for loan losses 
accounting for loan classifications  accrual status  and determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on regulatory guidance 
this guidance includes  but is not limited to  generally accepted accounting principles  the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy issued by the federal financial institutions examination council  the joint policy statement on the allowance for loan losses methodologies issued by the federal financial institutions examination council and guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  the allowance for loan losses includes a reserve calculation based on an evaluation of loans determined to be impaired  risk ratings  historical losses  loans past due  collateral values and cost of disposal and other subjective factors 
goodwill 
the original value of goodwill was determined by allocating the purchase price to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
periodically  goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
this test involves calculating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
thus  the carrying value of goodwill is subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment 
management strategy our strategy is to operate as an independent retail oriented financial institution dedicated to serving the needs of customers in our market area 
we are committed to providing a broad range of products and services to meet the needs of our consumer and small business customers 
as part of this commitment  we expect to continue our origination of higher credit quality residential and commercial real estate loans to borrowers in our market area and commercial real estate loans to borrowers outside our current market area 
our focus in will be accelerated growth in commercial lending  maintaining a high level of customer service  growth of core deposits  continued improvement of credit quality  advancing our technology  and repositioning of our marketing and sales culture 
we are dedicating resources to these initiatives that management believes will lead to a higher level of profitability and overall success 
management believes focusing on these areas in will serve the company well into the future 
we intend to continue to capitalize on the acquisition of msb financial  inc with further expansion of our lending activities in calhoun county 

table of contents changes in financial condition from december  to december  general 
monarch s total assets increased by million or to million at december  compared to million at december  increases in cash and securities in were offset by decreases in loans and premises and equipment 
loans 
monarch s net loan portfolio decreased by million  or from million at december  to million at december  gross loans decreased million or from million at december  to million at december  during the quarter ended june   the bank sold million of one to four family and commercial real estate loans and properties which had been foreclosed and had a recorded balance of million 
the bank had a loss of million on the sale but had previously established reserves for this group of assets so no additional loss provisions were necessary as a result of this transaction 
the purpose of the loan sale was to reduce the amount of problem assets on the bank s books so management could continue to focus on returning the bank to profitability 
in addition to the sale  the decreases in loan balances were due to repayments and payoffs on existing loans exceeding new loan production 
these repayments include payoffs of certain problem loans that management encouraged 
total loan originations decreased from million in to million in one to four family originations have declined as new loan production has declined along with the mortgage market and as management has eliminated the origination of subprime loans 
commercial real estate loans have declined due to the loan sale  the payoff of some problem credits and the payoff of performing loans that were refinanced elsewhere 
the commercial lending department and management spent a significant amount of time during working on improving the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio and this has contributed to the lack of new commercial loan origination 
management expects future growth in the loan portfolio to come from increased originations of commercial real estate and business loans as well as expanded geographic outreach facilitated by the acquisition 
the introduction of online mortgage origination is expected to expand the bank s mortgage lending activities within its current market area by offering convenience to borrowers and realtors and may lead to some originations in areas contiguous to the bank s current market 
securities 
the bank s security portfolio increased to million at december  from million at december   or 
securities were of total assets at december  as compared to at december  during  securities were purchased to offset the decline in the loan portfolio 
management purchases securities to maintain sufficient liquidity and to provide yield to offset declines in the loan portfolio 
liabilities 
monarch s deposits increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase was primarily in certificates of deposit cds as the bank increased its reliance on brokered cds to maintain sufficient liquidity and to fund repayment of borrowings 
brokered cds increased from million at december  to million at december  the bank did experience a million increase in non interest bearing deposit accounts but did not experience deposit increases in other areas 
the bank continues to compete for core deposits and management understands the issues involved with maintaining control over its cost of funds 
federal home loan bank advances decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to repayment of outstanding advances and the replacement of these advances with brokered deposits 
in an effort to manage our interest rate risk  monarch has utilized longer term fixed rate federal home loan bank advances to extend the overall maturity of our liabilities as we try to increase our level of core deposits 
while the interest rates paid on these advances is high relative to current market rates  the longer term advances allow the bank to better match the term of these advances against anticipated maturities of loans in an attempt to reduce future interest rate risk 
we expect this strategy to help improve net interest margin as long as interest rates continue to rise 
equity 
total equity amounted to million at december  and million at december   or and  respectively  of total assets at both dates 
the increase in equity over the period was due primarily to net income of million offset by the payment of  in dividends

monarch reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  and net income of  in the increase in earnings in was primarily due to higher net interest income and the recovery of previous provisions for loan losses resulting from improved commercial credit quality 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to million for compared to million in interest income increased million and interest expense increased  our net interest margin increased from in to in due to yields on interest earning assets increasing more rapidly than costs of interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin increased from in to in primarily from acquiring deposits that reduced the bank s cost of funds 
increases in interest income and interest expense are further explained in the interest income and interest expense sections that follow 

table of contents interest income 
interest income increased million during the year ended december  the four key factors contributing to this growth were million in commercial loan growth  a million increase in home equity lines of credit  million in home equity loan growth and an increase of million in investment securities 
the average yield on earning assets increased as a result of these factors as well as much higher yields on fed funds  overnight deposits and investment securities 
interest income increased million in as a result of increased earning assets from the acquisition of msb financial  inc the average yield on earning assets declined due to the lower yielding loans acquired as well as increased origination of adjustable rate loans 
management believes the increased weighting of adjustable rate loans in the loan portfolio will help increase interest income in the future as market interest rates rise 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased  in this was primarily due to a  increase in our cost of funds for deposits which was partially offset by a  decrease in our cost of funds resulting from repayments of million of federal home loan bank advances 
the overall yield on advances is expected to decline in subsequent years and these advances are projected to be replaced with deposits that have a lower cost of funds 
total interest expense increased  in this was primarily due to a  decrease in our cost of funds which was offset by a  increase in interest on fixed rate federal home loan bank advances assumed in the acquisition 
deposits acquired from msb financial  inc were significantly lower costing that our existing deposit balances 
provision for loan losses 
the bank recorded a recovery of loan losses of  for the year ended december  compared to a million provision for the year ended december  the recovery of provisions was possible due to the bank receiving payoffs in on two loan relationships totaling million for which the bank had previously provided loan loss allowances of  the bank s net charge offs were million in compared to million for the increased chargeoffs in provided for in are primarily the result of losses incurred on the sale of loans completed during the second quarter of as well as the bank continuing to aggressively deal with problem loans 
during the past several years we have continued to be aggressive in foreclosing on delinquent one to four family loans in an attempt to improve the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the result has been higher than historical chargeoffs  as well as decreased delinquencies on this type of loans 
the improvement of asset quality remains a priority of management and may affect the bank s ability to grow its portfolio in the future 
see loans discussion above 
the bank s net charge offs were million in compared to  for the increased provision for was due to the chargeoffs we have experienced  increases in our nonperforming loans  management identifying certain commercial loans as watch credits  and the resulting impact on the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
during  the bank charged off million of a million loan relationship secured by a commercial building in southwest michigan 
the relationship included two loans which were made to fund the construction of a commercial building in southwest michigan that was completed in both loans were placed into nonaccrual status as of june  in june  the bank foreclosed on the property in an attempt to satisfy the debt 
the foreclosure was subject to redemption rights by the borrower that expired in june the borrower has contested the expiration of redemption rights and the bank not taken possession of the property 
this property is recorded in real estate owned as of december  also  late in  management became aware of financial stress being experienced by two related borrowers whose indebtedness to the bank totals million 
due to the deteriorating financial strength of the borrowers  management deemed it prudent and necessary to establish loss allowances totaling million resulting from these two relationships 
also  management has determined that within the loan portfolio acquired from msb financial  inc there is an indication that future losses may exceed those experienced by marshall savings bank prior to the acquisition 
during and  we have experienced higher than historical chargeoffs on one to four family and consumer loans 
while a larger portion of our chargeoffs has been related to subprime loans  in  we began to realize the benefits of controls implemented with regard to subprime loans 

table of contents noninterest income 
noninterest income was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees and service charges on deposit accounts increased  due to higher fee levels from our overdraft protection program 
loan servicing fees increased  as a result of a larger loan servicing portfolio 
other remaining noninterest income increased  due to larger net gains on the sale of foreclosed properties  in compared to  in  higher rental income  in compared to  in  and no gains or losses on investment securities for compared to  in losses on the sale of investments in the increased fees helped offset a decrease in gains from sale of loans which decreased to  compared to  for the year ended december  as mortgage banking activities continued to decline 
management will be placing greater emphasis on originating loans held for sale in in an effort to improve these results 
noninterest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily the result of increased fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
fees and service charges on deposit accounts have increased significantly due to the number of savings and checking accounts acquired 
also  during  the bank began an overdraft protection program which has been successful in increasing fees earned 
the increased fees helped offset a decline in gains from sale of loans which decreased to  from million for the year ended december  as mortgage banking activities declined significantly in compared to the same period in losses on sales of investment securities were  for whereas the company had no significant securities activity in the past 
these losses were the result of a strategy to increase the yield on the investment portfolio by selling securities that carried below market coupon rates and reinvesting in securities at market rates 
other income increased  in  primarily due to income from our investment services activity of  we started offering investment services during as msb financial had previously offered the service 
earnings on company owned life insurance also helped increase other income by  the life insurance policies which produced the income were acquired as part of the acquisition of msb financial inc net gains on sales of foreclosed properties amounted to  during as compared to a net loss of  during noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses increased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  foreclosed property expense increased to  in from  in as a result of the bank taking  in writedowns based on recent assessments of the appraised value of repossessions 
data processing expense increased to  in from  in as we continue to stay current with advancing technology which involved a  increase in service bureau expense  a  increase in licenses and software expense data processing expense and a  increase other related expense most of which were data maintenance expenses 
amortization of core deposit intangible amounted to  for compared to  in we expect the expense to be approximately  in and will carefully monitor whether additional amortization is needed 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights amounted to  for compared to  in we expect the expense for to be higher than in as our portfolio continues to grow 
all other increases in noninterest expense were not significant 
noninterest expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the cost of the operations acquired 
in addition  the company incurred costs related to the termination of its former ceo 
severance costs were  and legal fees in connection with the severance were  the company does not anticipate any additional expense in connection with this matter 
we also incurred an additional  in costs related to a data processing conversion necessitated by the acquisition 
professional services increased  in due to additional costs related to being a public company  employee recruitment  employee benefit administration  legal assistance in connection with problem loans and the ceo termination mentioned above 
management expects to continue increased spending for professional fees as well as additional costs related to staffing due to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  specifically section compliance 
amortization of core deposit intangible amounted to  in compared to in income taxes 
monarch recorded an income tax expense for the year ended december  of  on income before tax of million which represented an effective tax rate of of income before tax 
in  we recorded an income tax recovery of million which represented an effective tax rate of of income before tax 
in  we recorded an income tax expense of  on income before tax of  for an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the effective tax rates and the federal corporate income tax rate of is attributable to the low income housing credits available to the bank from the investment in the limited partnership as well as fluctuation of permanent book and tax differences such as non taxable income and non deductible expenses 

table of contents liquidity and commitments we are required to maintain appropriate levels of liquid assets under ots regulations 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets at levels above those believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
at december   our liquidity ratio  which is our liquid assets as a percentage of net withdrawable savings deposits with a maturity of one year or less and current borrowings  was 
this level of liquidity is higher than that maintained last year 
management is confident they will be able to effectively address the bank s liquidity issues while facilitating increased profitability 
monarch s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
monarch s primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  overnight deposits and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and overnight deposits are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
monarch also generates cash through borrowings 
monarch utilizes federal home loan bank advances to leverage its capital base and provide funds for its lending and investment activities  and to enhance its interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in overnight deposits and short term treasury and governmental agency securities 
on a longer term basis  monarch maintains a strategy of investing in various investments and lending products 
monarch uses its sources of funds primarily to meet its ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals and to fund loan commitments 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december   totaled million 
based on historical experience  management believes that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit can be retained by continuing to pay competitive interest rates 
if necessary  additional funding sources include additional deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
management is committed to increase our core deposit balances and is willing to offer interest rates higher than those of the competition 
based on current collateral levels  at december   monarch could borrow an additional million from the federal home loan bank at prevailing interest rates 
this borrowing capacity can be increased in the future if monarch pledges additional collateral  such as securities  to the federal home loan bank 
monarch anticipates that it will continue to have sufficient funds  through deposits and borrowings  to meet its current commitments 
for the year ended december   monarch had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to a decrease of million for the year ended december  the bank s primary sources of funds during were net income of million  a net increase in deposits of million  proceeds from federal home loan bank advances of million  proceeds from the sale of foreclosed assets of million and proceeds from the maturity of securities of million 
the primary uses of funds in were for purchases of investments of million and repayments of federal home loan bank advances totaling million 
the bank s primary sources of funds during were the net effect of securities transactions of million and operating activities including the sale of mortgage loans which provided million 
the primary use of funds in was the acquisition of msb financial  inc which used million  a decrease of deposits of million and loan originations  net of collections of million 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the total unused commercial and consumer lines of credit were million 
as of december  there were outstanding commitments under letters of credit of  the company has no arrangements with any other entities that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents contractual obligations the company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations and commitments are payments due by period less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands certificates of deposit fhlb advances total amount of commitment expiration per period less than after total year years years years dollars in thousands commitments to grant loans unfunded commitments under helocs unfunded commitments under commercial locs letters of credit total long term obligations also include the liability under the company s director deferred compensation plans 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the plans 
capital consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization  monarch actively seeks to maintain a well capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards 
as of december   monarch exceeded all capital requirements of the ots 
monarch s regulatory capital ratios at that date were as follows tangible capital  leverage capital   and total risk based capital  
these levels are higher than at december  due to net income for the year ended december  the regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized are  and  respectively 
in  management does not anticipate seeking additional capital 
on january   management issued a press release announcing an intention to repurchase  of its outstanding shares in the open market in block trades or privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program was effective january  and repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock available for general corporate purposes 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 

table of contents the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of noninterest expense 
such expense items as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
we previously employed a strategy of fixed rate long term borrowing to guard against rising interest rates 
the rising interest rate environment in led to an increased net interest income 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors sets and recommends the asset and liability policies of the bank which are implemented by the asset and liability management committee 
the asset and liability management committee is comprised of members of our senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability management committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability management committee generally meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections 
the chief financial officer is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementation and strategies to the board of directors  at least quarterly 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have focused our strategies on originating shorter term consumer loans  commercial construction and commercial permanent real estate loans for retention in our portfolio  selling a significant portion of the long term  fixed rate residential mortgage loans we make  managing our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships with an emphasis on core  non certificate deposits  supplementing these with brokered deposits  as appropriate  and maintaining longer term borrowings at fixed interest rates to offset the negative impact of longer term fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio 
future borrowings are expected to be short term to reduce the average maturity of our borrowings 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability management committee may determine to increase monarch s interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain the net interest margin 
in addition  in an effort to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity  in and we sold million and million  respectively  of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans in the secondary market 
we expect to continue to sell a significant portion of our originated long term  fixed rate  one to four family loans but may retain some portion of our year and shorter  fixed rate loans 

table of contents the ots provides monarch with the information presented in the following table 
it presents the expected change in monarch s net portfolio value at september  that would occur upon an immediate change in interest rates based on ots assumptions  but without giving effect to any steps that management might take to counteract that change 
change in interest rates basis points bp net portfolio value as rate shock in rates net portfolio value of present value of assets amount change change npv ratio change bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp bp  bp  bp bp   bp bp n m n m n m n m n m assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
not meaningful because some market rates would compute to a rate less than the ots uses certain assumptions in assessing the interest rate risk of savings institutions 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the bank  like other financial institutions  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
our net interest margin can change  either positively or negatively  as the result of increases or decreases in market interest rates 
some factors affecting net interest margin are outside of our control  market interest rates are but one factor affecting the bank s net interest margin 
however  management has the ability  through its asset liability management and pricing policies to affect the bank s net interest margin notwithstanding the level of market interest rates 
the preceding table indicates the bank s net portfolio value will decrease in a moderately increasing or decreasing interest rate scenario plus or minus basis points and management believes that its net interest margin will behave similarly 
if rising interest rates stifle loan demand or create additional competitive pressures in attracting and retaining deposits  the bank s desire for growth in total assets may cause management to alter its strategy that could negatively impact the net interest margin 
while the bank saw its net interest margin decline during the period of low interest rates  the net interest margin has increased during the rising interest rate environment of the last months 
the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes  as well as the sector affected short term vs 
long term will have an impact on the bank s net interest margin 

table of contents the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes to interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative instruments  or trading portfolio as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans receivable  mortgage backed securities and investment securities were calculated without adjusting the contractual maturity dates for expectations of repayments 
expected maturity date values for non maturity  interest bearing deposits were based on the opportunity for repricing
