the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock and paid  in cash for of the voting equity interests in heritage 
heritage was the parent of heritage bank  which operated eight banking offices in alabama

selected data for heritage at january  is presented below assets loans deposits equity please refer to note t  mergers and acquisitions  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of the company in item of this annual report for additional historical financial information with respect to heritage 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts 
wherever feasible  we utilize third party information to provide management with estimates 
although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process  management evaluates the results  challenges assumptions used and considers other factors which could impact the estimation 
the following discussion presents some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
the critical accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan loss and the related provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment as recognized under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade 
another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under fasb statement  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan statement 
the balance of these loans determined to be impaired under statement and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments  the unemployment rate in our market  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses 

table of contents 
index to financial statements certain loans acquired in the heritage acquisition are accounted for under american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop 
the loans are carried at values which represent management s estimate of the future cash flow of these loans 
increases in expected cash flows to be collected from the contractual cash flows will be recognized as an adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life  while decreases in expected cash flows will be recognized as an impairment 
management continually monitors these loans as part of their normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated cash flows 
for a discussion of our loan policies and procedures  please refer to the disclosures in this item under the heading risk management credit risk and allowance for loan losses 
goodwill arising from business acquisitions represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in our banking and insurance operations 
the value of this goodwill is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in the face of competition 
as such  the value of our goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue  which is driven by the volume of business transacted and the market share acquired 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could result in additional expense and adversely impact earnings in future periods 
in january  we adopted the provisions of fasb statement r statement r 
statement r requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees 
we have recognized compensation expense on our share based payments since when we adopted the provisions of statement for a description of our assumptions utilized in calculating the fair value of our share based payment  please refer to note l employee benefit and deferred compensation plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our independent actuary firm prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under fasb statement no 
 as modified by fasb statement no

the pension plan covered under fasb statement no 
was curtailed as of december  we believe we employ appropriate methods for these calculations and that the results of such calculations closely approximate the actual cost 
we review the calculated results for reasonableness and compare those calculations to prior period costs 
we also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations 
we monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations

this program provides the client with a choice of seven value priced transaction accounts 
the cornerstone of this program is the free  full service checking account 
public funds  one of a number of alternatives that the company utilizes to meet its liquidity needs  may be readily obtained based on the company s aggressiveness in pricing 
the source of funds that we select depends on the terms and how those terms assist us in mitigating interest rate risk 
interest spread is the difference between the interest earned on earning assets and the interest paid on costing liabilities 
because we are cognizant of interest spread  funds are only acquired when needed and at a rate that is prudent under the circumstances 
normally  public fund time deposits are higher costing due to the volume of the deposits and because they are obtained through a bid process 
if demand for those funds rises  the cost of those deposits increases and vice versa

credit quality and policies are major concerns of these committees 
we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio

allowance factors established by management are applied to each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance factors are established based on our loss experience  adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios  as well as regulatory guidelines for criticized loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively for impairment 
for impaired loans  a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its estimated net realizable value 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for problem loans of or greater by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the ultimate collectibility of an impaired loan s principal is in doubt  wholly or partially  the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor and adjusts the loan credit grade accordingly 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
foreclosure proceedings are initiated after all collection efforts have failed 
the collateral is purchased from the borrower at public auction for fair market value  with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price 
the purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance 
if the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds  the deficient balance is sent to the loan committee comprised of the board of directors for charge off approval 
these charge offs reduce the allowance for loan losses 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management increases the allowance by a charge to the provision for loan losses 
on a monthly basis  management and the board of directors review loan ratios 
these ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans  the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans  nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans 
in addition  management reviews past due ratios by officer  community bank and company 
provision for loan losses to average loans the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is an amount which  in the judgment of management  is necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is adequate to meet the inherent risks of losses in our loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was   and  for  and  respectively 
factors considered in management s assessment for the periods presented include the risk rating of individual credits  the size and diversity of our loan portfolio  current trends in net charge offs  trends in non performing loans  trends in past due loans and current economic conditions in the markets in which we operate

index to financial statements the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was at december  as compared to at december  the reduction of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was caused by our improved credit quality and growth in the loan portfolio 
sop prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan loss for loans acquired in which the acquirer concludes that the acquirer will not collect the contractual payments 
certain loans acquired as a part of our acquisition of heritage experienced credit deterioration since date of origination to the date of acquisition 
these loans  which had an outstanding balance of  at the date of acquisition  are now carried at a balance which management believes  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each respective loan at the date of acquisition  represents their future cash flows 
we continually monitor these loans as part of our normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated future cash flows 
the company did not increase the provision for loan losses through a charge to the income statement for these loans during nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are contractually past due days  on which interest continues to accrue 
generally  the accrual of income is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt  or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually days past due  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
management  the loss management committee and our loan review staff closely monitor loans that are considered to be nonperforming 
restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition 
such concessions may include reduction in interest rates  or deferral of interest or principal payments 
the following table shows the principal amounts of nonperforming and restructured loans at december in thousands nonperforming loans nonaccruing accruing loans past due days or more total nonperforming loans restructured loans total nonperforming and restructured loans interest income foregone all loans where information exists about possible credit problems that would cause us to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with the current terms of the loan have been reflected in the table above 
approximately of the december  nonaccrual loans balance was attributable to one large credit relationship 
the relationship was secured by income producing real estate properties 
in the first quarter of  we foreclosed on the collateral securing this relationship 
as a result  the nonaccrual balance was reduced  as we brought to final resolution this one problem credit relationship 
during  a large portion of the properties securing this relationship were sold to third party buyers

interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities 
management believes the most significant impact on the company s financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure 
we have an asset liability committee alco which is authorized by the board of directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to make decisions relating to that process 
the alco s goal is to structure our asset liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital 
profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same 
table of contents 
index to financial statements basis 
we monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value npv using rate shock analysis 
net interest income simulations measure the short term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest in a more rigorous and explicit fashion 
our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios 
the npv measures our long term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest 
npv is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time 
a decrease in npv due to a specified rate change indicates a decline in the long term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet 
the following rate shock analysis depicts the estimated impact on net interest income and npv of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december percentage change in change in interest rates in basis points net interest income net portfolio value the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents our npv in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
the balance sheet structure as of december  indicates we are asset sensitive 
to mitigate our interest rate risk in the rising rate environment  we implemented a strategy of concentrating our loan growth in the form of variable products while extending the terms of the funding 
the results of the interest rate shock analysis are within the limits set by the board of directors 
the above scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of and basis points 
recently  it has been the federal reserve board s policy to adjust the target federal funds rate over a period of time in basis point increments 
as interest rates are adjusted gradually over a period of time  we are able to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk 
the preceding measures assume no change in asset liability compositions 
thus  the measures do not reflect actions the alco may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates 
the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions 
these business assumptions are based upon our experience  business plans and published industry experience 
key assumptions employed in the model include asset prepayment speeds  the relative price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non maturity deposits 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  actual results will differ from simulated results 
the company enters into mortgage loan commitments with its customers 
under the mortgage loan commitments  interest rates for a mortgage loan may be locked into for up to thirty days with the customer 
once a mortgage loan commitment is entered into with a customer  the company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell such loan on a best efforts basis 
as such  the company does not incur risk if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close 
other than mortgage loan commitments  we have not entered into any other derivative activities 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements core deposits are a major source of funds used by the bank to meet cash flow needs 
maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to assuring the bank s liquidity 
when evaluating the movement of these funds  even during large interest rate changes  it is apparent that we continue to attract deposits that can be used to meet cash flow needs 
this is evidenced by our increase in core deposits during  even when our acquisition of heritage is excluded 
management continues to monitor the liquidity and potentially volatile liabilities ratios to ensure compliance with alco targets 
our security portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs 
these assets have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed 
within the next twelve months the securities available for sale portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow equal to of the carrying value of the total securities portfolio 
other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds purchased and advances from the fhlb 
interest is charged at the market federal funds rate on federal funds purchased and fhlb advances 
although  we did not have any federal funds purchased outstanding at december   we did utilize federal funds purchased during the year for short term liquidity needs 
funds obtained from the fhlb are used primarily to match fund real estate loans in order to minimize interest rate risk and may be used to meet day to day liquidity needs 
the total amount of remaining credit available to us from the fhlb was  as of december   our outstanding balance with the fhlb was  we also maintain lines of credits with other commercial banks totaling  these are unsecured lines of credit maturing at various times within the next twelve months 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credits 
at december   our total cost of funds  including noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  was  up from at december  noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts made up approximately of our average total deposits and borrowed funds at that date  comparable to at december  interest bearing transaction accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts made up approximately of our funds for and had an average cost of 
another significant source of funds was time deposits  making up of the total deposits and borrowed funds with an average cost of for  compared to of the total with an average cost of at december  fhlb advances  typically used for clients who prefer longer term fixed rate loans  made up approximately of our average total deposits and borrowed funds with an average cost of 
our strategy in choosing funds is focused on attempting to mitigate interest rate risk  and thus we utilize funding sources that are commensurate with the interest rate risk associated with the assets 
accordingly  management targets growth of non interest bearing deposits 
while we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose  we do influence those choices with the rates we offer and with the deposit specials we offer 
for example  public funds may be readily obtained based on our aggressiveness in pricing 
we constantly monitor our funds position and evaluate the effect various funding sources have on our financial position 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december   compared to  at december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the same period of during  the company used  to fund loan growth as compared to  for further  proceeds from the sale and maturity of our investment portfolio decreased  for as compared to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the same period of during  the company generated cash flow of  through deposit growth 
cash flow from deposits was the primary source to fund the loan growth in our ability to grow deposits also allowed us to place less reliance on other borrowed funds as we paid down  in short and long term borrowings
