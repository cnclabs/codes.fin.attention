critical accounting policies  estimates assumptions the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies  litigation and supplier incentives 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company s most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  distribution and promotion of its products 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
no material adjustments to the company s accounting policies were made in specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
the company derives revenue from three primary sources server and storage hardware  software  and services 
revenue is recorded in the period in which the goods are delivered or services are rendered and when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company reduces revenue for discounts  sales incentives  estimated customer returns and other allowances 
discounts are offered based on the volume of products and services purchased by customers 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recognized in cost of goods sold 
regarding hardware sales  revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the customer and when there are not unfulfilled obligations that affect the customer s final acceptance of the arrangement 
a portion of the company s hardware sales involves shipment directly from its suppliers to the end user customers 
in such transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and the customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and bears credit risk if the customer does not pay for the goods 
as the principal with the customer  the company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold when it is notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
in certain limited instances  as shipping terms dictate  revenue is recognized at the point of destination 
regarding software sales  the company offers proprietary software as well as remarketed software to its customers 
generally  software sales do not require significant production  modification  or customization at the time of shipment physically or electronically to the customer 
as such  revenue from both proprietary and remarketed software sales is generally recognized when the software has been shipped 
for software delivered electronically  delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer either takes possession of the software via downloading or has been provided with the requisite codes that allow for immediate access to the software 
regarding sales of services  the company offers proprietary and third party services to its customers 
proprietary services generally are as follows consulting  installation  integration  and maintenance 
revenue relating to consulting  installation  and integration 
table of contents services is recognized when the service is performed 
revenue relating to maintenance services is recognized evenly over the coverage period of the underlying agreement 
in addition to proprietary services  the company offers third party service contracts to its customers 
in such instances  the supplier is the primary obligor in the transaction and the company bears credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the customer 
since the company is acting as an agent or broker with respect to such sales transactions  the company reports revenue in the amount of the commission equal to the selling price less the cost of sale received rather than reporting revenue in the full amount of the selling price with separate reporting of the cost of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as historical trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs frequent credit evaluations of its customers 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  net of related reserves 
the cost of inventory is computed using a weighted average method 
the company s inventory is monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation right of return status  and technological obsolescence  as well as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
the company provides a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on several factors including an analysis of historical sales of products  the age of the inventory and return provisions provided by the distribution agreements 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
deferred taxes 
the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets is expensed in the period such determination is made 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease tax expense in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
the fair value of goodwill is estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in the period such determination was made 
for further information concerning the company s calculation of impairment  see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other special charges 
the company recorded a reserve in connection with reorganizing its ongoing business 
the reserve principally includes estimates related to employee separation costs  the consolidation and impairment of facilities deemed inconsistent with continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
determination of the impairment of assets is discussed above in goodwill and long lived assets 
facilities reserves are calculated using a probability weighted present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a credit adjusted risk free rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
valuation of accounts payable 
the company s accounts payable has been reduced by amounts claimed to vendors for returns  price protection and other amounts related to incentive programs 
amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by the company and confirmation of agreement by our vendors 
historically  the company s estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by vendors 
supplier programs 
the company receives funds from suppliers for price protection  product sales incentives and marketing and training programs  which are generally recorded  net of direct costs  as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses according to the nature of the program 
the product sales incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
the company accrues supplier sales incentives and other supplier incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in accordance with the terms of the related program 
actual supplier sales incentives may vary based on volume or other sales 
table of contents achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
recently issued accounting standard in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards statement revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in operating results based on their fair values 
statement r will be effective for the company on april   the beginning of the company s fiscal statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company plans to use the modified prospective method to adopt the provisions of statement r 
as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s operating results 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted statement r in prior periods  the company believes the impact would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions has not been significant 
in may  the fasb issued statement  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application a term defined by the statement to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the effect of a change 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
in addition  statement redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt statement beginning april  in november  the fasb issued statement  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  companies must apply the standard prospectively
