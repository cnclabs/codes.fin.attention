item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in this report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading supplier of global positioning system  or gps  semiconductor solutions designed to provide location awareness capabilities in high volume mobile consumer and commercial systems 
our products have been integrated into mobile consumer devices such as mobile phones  automobile navigation systems  personal digital assistants  handheld navigation devices and gps based peripheral devices  and into commercial systems such as fleet management and road tolling systems 
as of december   we had an intellectual property portfolio of patents granted in the united states and patents granted in foreign countries 
we market and sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  of four target platforms wireless handheld devices  including mobile phones  automotive electronics systems  including navigation and telematics systems  portable computing devices  including personal digital assistants and notebook computers  and embedded consumer devices  such as recreational gps handhelds  digital cameras and watches 
additionally  we market and sell our products to value added manufacturers  or vams  who typically provide gps modules or sub systems to the end customer  and through intellectual property partners  who integrate our core technology into their products 
intellectual property partners are typically large semiconductor companies 
as usage of gps technology for high volume applications is generally in early stages of deployment  it is difficult to predict market growth or growth drivers reliably 
while some of the applications  such as oem automotive navigation systems  are well developed  most high growth applications are just starting to emerge 
in fiscal  we saw the emergence of portable navigation systems as a new growth driver and in it was a major driver in our growth  while the location based services  or lbs  market for wireless operators is in its early stages 
our long term growth depends on maintaining a leadership position in such markets and enabling multiple growth drivers across our target platforms 
we are currently focusing significant efforts on enabling the end to end platform for successful lbs deployment by wireless operators and for other consumer applications 
successful alliances with wireless operators  mobile phone vendors and wireless platform providers are critical to our success in this emerging market 
in april  we acquired kisel microelectronics  ab  a privately held limited liability company  or kisel  based in stockholm  sweden  in june  we acquired the gps chip set product line of motorola  inc  a delaware corporation  or motorola  and in december  we acquired impulsesoft  a privately held company based in bangalore  india 
the acquisition of kisel  a company with extensive expertise in complex integrated transceiver designs  is intended to complement our existing rf engineering group as the design of rf transceivers is a critical core technology and is an essential element in complex multi radio system solutions 
the acquisition of motorola s gps chip set product line is intended to provide broader product offerings and better overall support infrastructure to serve motorola and sirf s other customers worldwide  through the acquisition of a team with a critical mass of gps expertise  product lines that complement our existing products and a strong customer base 
the acquisition of impulsesoft  an expert in bluetooth stereo solutions and embedded software  is intended to provide users of bluetooth technology with a rich audio experience and deliver and support value added embedded software solutions to complement our chip set offerings 
in february  we announced three new products a sirfstariii  our latest generation gps architecture with sirfloc client software  both in a chip set and intellectual property core form  b sirfsoft with sirfloc client software  our gps solution for signal processing in software on application processor powered wireless 
table of contents platforms and c sirfloc server  a multimode aiding platform that is deployed in wireless networks to improve the performance of gps enabled devices 
in  we launched a range of new products including a the gsc family  our highly integrated  low power gps products  which are based on the sirfstariii architecture that combine radio frequency integrated circuit and a digital signal processing circuit in a single mm x mm package and b the gsc family  which combines radio frequency integrated circuit and a digital signal processing circuit in a single package with one third the power and half the size of it s predecessor 
strong interest and design win activity for these products especially the sirfstariii based products with robust application software are important for our revenue growth in in the second quarter of  we started to ramp up the first product line based on our sirfstariii architecture in volume production and in the second half of  sirfstariii was a significant contributor to our revenue stream 
our sirfloc server platform is key to our success in penetrating the market for wireless operators and in the third quarter of  one of our operator customers commenced deployment of our sirfloc server platform in their network 
our sirfsoft with sirfloc client software is not yet in high volume commercial production 
we are also seeing significant demand in the market for low power and small size gps functionality 
our ability to meet these market requirements is a key element for our revenue growth 
subsequent to year end  in january  we announced two new products a sirflink  our first multifunction architecture and product line that utilizes the synergies between gps and bluetooth for a range of consumer platforms and accessories and b sirfinstantfix  our unique service that minimizes the start up wait time for gps systems 
the announcement of sirflinki marks our expansion into offerings that combine our sirfstariii gps technology with additional value added wireless connectivity functions 
our ability to develop and deliver new products successfully depends on a number of factors  including our ability to predict market requirements  anticipate changes in technology standards  and develop and introduce new products that meet market needs in a timely manner 
if we do not deliver new products on a timely basis or if these products do not achieve market acceptance  the variability of our revenue may increase and our revenue  earnings and stock price may decline 
our markets are becoming more competitive resulting in increased pricing pressure on our products 
while we believe that we have leading edge technology  our ability to compete and maintain current product margin levels depends on faster design cycle time and lower cost structure 
in the second quarter of  we opened a design center in india to expand our ability to develop products rapidly 
in fiscal  we acquired three businesses intended to complement our existing engineering group and expand our product offerings we also reduced our overall cost structure by working with our semiconductor fabrication  packaging and testing vendors to reduce product costs  as well as through enhanced efficiencies in logistics management 
our operations are directly impacted by cyclicality in the semiconductor industry  which is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
this cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next 
in addition to the sale of chip sets  our business depends on the volume of production by our technology licensees  which in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  our results were impacted by cyclicality of consumer demand  delay in production release of our first sirfstariii based products  as well as lower than expected licensing revenues 
if we are unable to control expenses adequately in response to lower revenue from our chip set customers and technology licensees  our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenue 
in fiscal  two of our customers  which each accounted for or more of our net revenue  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
if we fail to successfully sell our products to one or more of our significant customers in any particular period  or if a large customer purchases fewer of our products  defers orders or fails to place additional orders with us  our net revenue could decline  and our operating results may not meet market expectations 

table of contents starting in our first quarter of  us generally accepted accounting principles require us to record a charge to earnings for the fair value of employee stock option grants and other equity incentives 
we may have significant and ongoing accounting charges resulting from employee stock option grants and other equity incentive expensing that could reduce our overall net income

this quarterly report on form q also includes trade names  trademarks and service marks of other companies and organizations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies include a revenue recognition  which impacts the recording of revenue  b valuation of inventories  which impacts cost of revenue and gross margin  c stock based compensation  which impacts cost of revenue  gross margin and operating expenses  as well as footnote disclosure  d accounts receivable allowance  which impacts general and administrative expense  e product warranty  which impacts cost of revenue and gross margin  f the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  the potential impairment of which impacts operating expenses  and e valuation of deferred income taxes which impacts benefit from provision for income taxes 
we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective  and therefore  their application would not have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
the following is a discussion of our most critical policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales to our direct customers  both oems and vams  when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title  as well as fixed or determinable pricing and probable collectibility 
transfer of title occurs based on defined terms in customer purchase orders for all shipments 
we record allowances at the time of sale to our direct customers for estimated sales returns 
we determine these allowances based upon historical rates of returns 
sales to distributors are made under agreements providing price protection and rights of return under certain circumstances 
we defer the recognition of revenue and the related cost of revenue on shipments to distributors that have rights of return and price protection privileges on unsold merchandise until the merchandise is sold by the distributors to their customers 
accounts receivable from distributors are recognized and inventory is released upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point we have a legally enforceable right to collection under normal payment terms 
revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that the product has been sold to the end customer 
information reported to us by the distributor includes quantity and end customer shipment information  as well as monthly inventory on hand at the distributor 
distributor month end inventory quantities are subsequently reconciled to deferred revenue balances 

table of contents we license rights to use our intellectual property to allow licensees to integrate our gps technology into their products 
we also license rights to use our premium software products to licensees to enable our chip sets to provide enhanced functionality in specific applications 
licensees pay ongoing royalties based on defined terms in software license agreements 
payments are generally made based on licensees sales of their products incorporating the licensed intellectual property or premium software 
royalty revenue is generally recognized at the time products containing the licensed intellectual property or premium software are sold by the licensees based on quarterly reports received from licensees detailing the number of chip sets shipped by licensees into which our intellectual property or premium software was embedded 
under certain software license agreements  licensees pay ongoing royalties based on the number of chip sets into which the premium software is embedded and revenue is recognized based on quarterly reports received from licensees detailing the number of chip sets into which the premium software was embedded 
for certain licensees  or estimated licensees  we estimate and record the royalty revenue earned in the quarter in which such sales occur  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
estimates of royalty revenue for the estimated licensees are based on forecasts provided by estimated licensees  an analysis of our sales of chip sets to estimated licensees and historical attach rates  historical royalty data for estimated licensees and current market and economic trends 
once we receive royalty reports from the estimated licensees  we record the variance between such reports and the estimate as royalty revenue in the quarter in which we receive the reports 
to date  such variances have not been significant 
subsequent to the sale  we have no obligation to provide any modification  customization  upgrades  or enhancements 
the cost of revenue associated with licenses is insignificant 
inventory 
we record a write down for inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  market conditions  product life cycle status  product development plans and current sales levels 
if future demand or market conditions for our products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory  we may be required to record additional write downs which would negatively impact gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products incorporating inventory that was previously written down are sold 
stock options 
we have elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for employee and director stock based compensation  and comply with the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
therefore  we do not record compensation expense for stock options granted to our employees when the exercise price equals the deemed fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period are fixed 
in accordance with sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 we disclose our pro forma net income and net income per share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
in calculating such fair value  we make certain assumptions  as disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements  consisting of the stock price volatility  expected life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
actual volatility  expected lives  interest rates and dividend yield may be different than our assumptions which would result in an actual value of the options being different than estimated 
in determining volatility values  starting in the first quarter of fiscal  we considered our historical and implied volatility  as well as historical and implied volatility of similar entities whose share or option prices are publicly traded 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal  we made reference to comparable companies within our industry due to the short time period for which a public market was available for our common stock 
we believe that this refinement will generate more representative estimates of fair value 
for discussion regarding the issuance of sfas r  see recent accounting pronouncements below 
accounts receivable allowance 
we make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the amount of aged accounts receivable  each customer s ability to pay  and our collection history with each customer 
we report 
table of contents charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts as a portion of selling  general and administrative costs 
we regularly review past due invoices to determine if an allowance is appropriate based on the risk category using the factors discussed above 
assumptions and judgments regarding collectibility of accounts could differ from actual events 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
as of december   of our receivables were concentrated in three customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of these customers could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and may require us to record additional charges that could adversely affect our operating results 
product warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we continuously monitor chip set returns for product failures and maintain a warranty reserve for the related expenses based on historical experience of similar products as well as other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our product warranty reserve includes specific accruals for known product issues and an accrual for an estimate of incurred but unidentified product issues based on historical activity 
due to effective product testing and the short time between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures  the warranty accrual based on historical activity and the related expense were not significant as of the periods presented 
assessment of long lived and other intangible assets and goodwill 
we are required to assess the potential impairment of identified intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill on an annual basis  and potentially more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow  which requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  projected capital expenditures  changes in our working capital and the relevant discount rate 
should actual results differ significantly from our current estimates  impairment charges may result 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  resulting in a deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance  
table of contents when recorded  would be included in our consolidated statements of operations as a provision for benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty of their realizability 
as of december   management reassessed the valuation allowance previously established against our deferred tax assets and based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we removed the valuation allowance from the deferred tax assets resulting in a corresponding income tax benefit 
during fiscal  we assessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and based on earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable adjustments to our tax liability 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be

this statement is now effective for our fiscal first quarter ending march  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method

prior periods remain unchanged and pro forma disclosures previously required by sfas no 
continue to be required 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
under sfas r  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
upon adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  we will apply the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of share based payments to employees and will apply the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we have evaluated the requirements of sfas r and sab and expects that the adoption of sfas r on january  will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we are currently evaluating whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts recognized within the consolidated results of operations that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in fiscal for such excess tax deductions was approximately million 
in fiscal the amount for such excess tax deductions was not significant and there were no excess tax deductions recognized in fiscal accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents product revenue 
the increase in product revenue in  as compared to resulted primarily from a increase in unit shipments of chip sets  which was due in part to increased sales of our first product line based on our sirfstariii architecture 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices  as compared to the corresponding prior year period 
the increase in product revenue in  as compared to resulted primarily from an increase in unit shipments of our chip sets partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
increased sales volumes in and were primarily due continued growth of the automotive market  especially the portable automotive navigation systems  the proliferation of gps in the pda market and continued growth of gps embedded consumer devices 
the increase in sales volume in was also due to the continued ramp up of our chip sets for the wireless handset market 
license royalty revenue 
license royalty revenue represented  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
license royalty revenue was relatively flat in  as compared to license royalty revenue as a percentage of total net revenue declined in  as compared to primarily due to a decline in the per unit royalty rates  although unit volumes increased year over year 
this relationship between license royalty revenue and total net revenue is expected to continue based our long term business model 
the increase in license royalty revenue as a percentage of net revenue in  as compared to was due primarily to a ramp up by licensees of products in the wireless handset market incorporating our licensed intellectual property  and to a lesser extent  increased royalty revenue on premium software licenses 
net revenue on export sales from the united states was approximately  and of our net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
net revenue on export sales from the united states to the asia pacific region accounted for approximately  and of net revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
export sales as a percentage of total net revenue from the united states in  as compared to  increased due to larger export sales to the asia pacific region 
the decrease in revenue recognized on export sales as a percentage of total net revenue from the united states in  as compared to was due primarily to significant shipments made in to a united states distributor operating on behalf of a foreign distributor in the asia pacific region  moderated by a shift in our customers supply chain to manufacturers located in the asia pacific region 
we anticipate that a significant amount of our net revenue will continue to reflect sales to customers in that region as many of our vam and contract manufacturer customers are located in asia 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in the asia pacific region  we believe that a significant amount of the systems designed and manufactured by these customers are subsequently sold through to oems outside of the asia pacific region 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
in  and  our largest customers collectively accounted for  and of our net revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross profit margin cost of revenue consists primarily of finished units or silicon wafers and costs associated with the assembly  testing and inbound and outbound shipping of our chip sets  costs of personnel and occupancy associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  all of which are associated with product revenue 
as we do not have long term  fixed supply agreements  our unit or wafer costs are subject to change based on the cyclical demand for semiconductor products 
cost of revenue was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  increasing in from  and in from cost of revenue in  as compared to increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of chip sets shipped  partially offset by a decrease in materials cost 
the increase in cost of revenue in  as compared to was due primarily to an increase in unit shipments of our chip sets and the associated costs to produce and support higher unit volumes 
product gross margin was  and in  and  respectively 
product gross margin in  as compared to increased slightly due to a decrease in materials cost  offset by lower average selling prices 
the decline in gross margin from to is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense recorded in cost of sales in  as compared to gross margin in both and 
table of contents were favorably impacted by increases in license royalty revenue  which has no cost of revenue  becoming a greater percentage of total net revenue  partially offset by declines in average selling prices 
in the future  our gross margin percentages may be affected by increased competition and related decreases in unit average selling prices particularly with respect to older generation products  changes in the mix of products sold including the extent of license royalty revenue  the availability and cost of products from our suppliers  manufacturing yields particularly on new products  increased volume and related volume price breaks  timing of volume shipments of new products and potential delays in introductions of new products 
as a result  we may experience declines in demand or average selling prices of our existing products  and our inventories on hand may become impaired  resulting in write offs either for excess quantities or lower of cost or market considerations 
such write offs  when determined  could have a material adverse effect on gross margins and results of operations 
operating expenses research and development research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  bonuses and benefits for engineering personnel  depreciation of engineering equipment  costs of outside engineering services from contractors and consultants  costs associated with physical implementation of chip designs  including the design and purchase of mask sets and prototype wafers and costs of hardware platforms required to validate chip designs and to develop and validate software 
research and development expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  increasing approximately in from  as well as in from research and development expense increased in  as compared to primarily due to a increase in headcount excluding the impact of the impulsesoft acquisition and headcount related expenses and development related activities of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in headcount is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of kisel and motorola s gps chip set product line in the second quarter of  as well as the overall growth of our business 
in the fourth quarter of  research and development headcount also increased with the acquisition of impulsesoft 
the increase in research and development expense is further attributable to increased costs associated with physical implementation of chip designs  increased stock compensation expense associated with our three recent acquisitions  as well as increased depreciation and amortization of engineering equipment and licensed technology 
the increase in  as compared to was impacted by an increase in headcount and related expenses of approximately million resulting from a increase in headcount  costs associated with physical implementation of chip designs of approximately million and costs of hardware platforms of approximately  both the costs associated with physical implementation of chip design and costs of hardware platforms related primarily to the development of sirfstariii  as well as sirfstariii and sirfstarii derivative products 
the increase in research and development expense was further impacted by a decline in engineering services income of approximately  and increased professional consulting expenses of approximately  engineering services income was   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop new products in the future 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions  customer support  public relations  tradeshows  advertising and other marketing activities 
sales and marketing expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  increasing in from and in from the increase in sales and marketing expense in  as compared to was due primarily to a increase in headcount and related expenses  offset by a reduction in outside representative commissions as a result of the increase in personnel 
the increase in sales and marketing expense in  as compared to was impacted by increases 
table of contents in headcount and related expenses of approximately million resulting from a increase in headcount  partially offset by a decrease of approximately  due to a decline in the number of commissionable accounts 
we expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel  expand our sales and marketing efforts and incur higher sales commissions with the anticipated growth of our business 
general and administrative general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits and related costs for finance and administrative personnel and for outside service expenses  including legal  accounting  consulting and recruiting

this calculation gave consideration to relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  product sales cycles  and the estimated life of the product derived from the underlying technology 
the value of the acquired ipr d reflects the relative value and contribution of the acquired research and development 
consideration was given to the stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred  and the expected cost to complete the project in determining the value assigned to the acquired ipr d

the line of credit is available through february and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
we had no borrowings under the line of credit as of december  or as of december   we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants  including borrowing base requirements 
we currently have no plans to obtain additional debt financing and do not foresee our bank line of credit having a significant impact on our ability to obtain equity financing 
we also have one capital lease agreement under which we had  in outstanding borrowings as of december  borrowings under this capital lease agreement bears interest at an annual effective rate of and is collateralized by the related equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of december   our cash equivalents and investment portfolio consisted of commercial paper  government bonds and money market funds 
our marketable securities consist of high quality debt securities with maturities beyond days at the date of acquisition  which mature within one year or less 
our long term investments consist of high quality debt securities with maturities beyond one year 
our investments are considered to be available for sale 
we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio primarily due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
a significant percentage of our investment portfolio represents investments in debt securities with original maturities of days or less  as reflected by the balance in our cash and equivalents caption on the face of our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have reviewed the remaining securities with original maturities greater than days classified as marketable securities and the remaining balance of securities classified as long term investments and have determined that a increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of these securities 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially impacted by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates is primarily related to our subsidiaries operating expenses  primarily in sweden  united kingdom  japan  taiwan and india  denominated in the respective local currency 
a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
all of our sales are transacted in us dollars
