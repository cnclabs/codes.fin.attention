table of contents overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges and towing vessels 
the company uses the inland waterway system of the us to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for large medium speed and high speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and railroad applications 
for  the company reported  for the second straight year the highest revenue  net earnings and earnings per share in its history 
the company reported net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  a significant improvement over the record setting net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  the record setting performance reflected continued strong petrochemical  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemical demand in its marine transportation segment  coupled with higher contract rate renewals and higher spot market pricing 
the us petrochemical and refining industries continued to operate their plants and refineries at high utilization rates 
the record results also reflected a favorable performance by the diesel engine services segment  positively impacted by strong service activity and direct parts sales in the majority of its marine  power generation and railroad markets  combined with higher service rates and parts pricing 
marine transportation during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies in the us products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers every day plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others 
consequently  the company s business tends to mirror the general performance of the us economy and the performance of the company s customer base

during  the demand for the movement of petrochemical products remained strong  with term contract customers continuing to operate their plants at high utilization rates  resulting in high barge utilization for most products 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  also remained strong  the result of refineries operating at close to full capacity  which generated high demand for the transportation of heavier residual oil by products 
refined petroleum products contributed of marine transportation revenue  experiencing normal gulf coast to midwest demand  however  the company s presence in the refined products market was reduced during as barges were diverted to the stronger gulf intracoastal waterway petrochemical market to meet term contract requirements 
in addition  the segment s refined products tank barge capacity has been reduced by the company s continued retirement of its single hull barges 
the agricultural chemical 
table of contents market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  was seasonally strong for  meeting the demand for the movement of imported liquid fertilizer into the midwest 
during  approximately of the marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues 
the contract and spot market mix provides the company with a stable revenue stream with less exposure to day to day pricing fluctuations 
contracts renewed during increased in the to average range  with some contracts increasing by a higher percentage and some by a lower percentage 
during and  contract renewals were in the to average range 
the higher average contract rate renewals for reflected strong industry demand as well as higher utilization rates for tank barges 
effective january   escalators for labor and the producer price index on numerous multiyear contracts resulted in rate increases for those contracts by to 
the company adjusts contract rates for fuel on either a monthly or quarterly basis  depending on the specific contract 
spot market rates in for most marine transportation markets were approximately to higher than and were above contract rates 
spot market rates include the cost of fuel and  during  the average cost of fuel consumed ranged from a low of per gallon in january to a high of per gallon in november 
the marine transportation segment s results were negatively impacted by record setting navigational delays of  days  more than the record setting  delays recorded in delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and barge during transit 
the measure includes transit delays caused by weather  lock congestion or closure and other navigational factors 
during january  high water conditions existed on the illinois and ohio rivers  and caused high water conditions on the lower mississippi river in late january and early february 
in addition  the upper ohio river was closed for two weeks in january and early february due to an accident at the belleville lock 
the gulf coast had numerous fog days in january and february 
during march  weather conditions throughout the mississippi river system and the gulf intracoastal waterway improved significantly 
navigating delays for the second quarter were down significantly  primarily due to favorable weather conditions 
the third quarter navigating delays increased significantly  as the segment was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
the company estimates the impact was 
per share 
hurricane katrina made landfall east of new orleans on august and hurricane rita made landfall on the texas louisiana border on september petrochemical and refinery facilities located in the paths or projected paths of the hurricanes shut down operations in advance of the storms 
waterways in the hurricane affected areas were closed and the company s equipment was moved out of the path of the storms or into protected areas 
the hurricanes caused no injuries to the company s vessel crews and no notable damage to the company s tank barge and towboat fleet or its facilities 
navigating delays for the fourth quarter declined  as weather conditions overall were favorable 
some icing occurred on the illinois and ohio rivers in december  but fog and high wind  which historically plague the gulf coast during the fourth quarter  were at a minimum 
the marine transportation operating margin for improved to compared with for improved demand and utilization  higher contract and spot market rates  and january  escalators on long term contracts all contributed to the higher operating margin 
in addition  the company s on going effort to eliminate unnecessary costs  improve the management of towing requirements  including more efficient use of horsepower  faster barge turnarounds and increased backhaul opportunities  also contributed to the improved margin 
the company s continued emphasis on safety  with and being record setting safety performance years  also contributed to the improved operating margin 

table of contents diesel engine services during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment of which was generated through service and from parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely tied to the industries it serves and  therefore  are influenced by the cycles of such industries 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market revenue markets serviced distribution customers marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lake ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations railroad passenger transit systems  class ii  shortline  industrial the company s diesel engine services segment s revenue and operating income increased and  respectively  compared with the record results reflected strong marine  power generation and railroad markets  as well as the full year impact of the company s april acquisition of walker  more fully described under acquisitions below 
higher service activities  coupled with improved service rates as well as parts pricing  positively impacted the diesel engine services segment s operating margin for improved to compared with for  reflecting the strong markets  higher service activities  which generally earn a higher operating margin than parts sales  increased pricing for service and parts  and higher labor utilization 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during  with net cash provided from operations of  a increase compared with  for in addition  the company generated cash from the disposition of assets of  and  from the exercise of stock options 
the cash was used for capital expenditures of  primarily for fleet replacement  enhancement and expansion   for the acquisition of the black oil products tank barge fleet of acl and a smaller diesel acquisition  and debt reduction of  the company reduced its debt to capitalization ratio from to during capital expenditures were  in and included  for new tank barge and towboat construction  and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet 
the tank barge construction program included seventeen  barrel capacity tank barges at a cost of  which are replacement barges for older barges removed from service 
the company took delivery and placed into service of the barges during  with the remaining barge delivered and placed into service in february the program also included twenty  barrel capacity tank barges and one  barrel capacity specialty barge at a cost of approximately  the company took delivery and placed into service all of the barges during these barges represent  barrels of additional capacity and will enable the company to satisfy additional demand from existing customers 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for new tank barge and towboat construction 
the program includes the construction of twenty three  barrel capacity tank barges at a cost of  subject to adjustment for the price of steel  of which will be additional capacity and eight of which will be replacement barges for older barges removed from service 
delivery of the barges will be throughout  with the final barge scheduled for delivery in january the program also includes the construction of four inland towboats at a cost of   of which was paid in december and included 
table of contents in the capital expenditures 
two towboats are scheduled to be placed into service in the second half of and two in the first quarter 
the company remains in excellent financial position to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in a consolidating marine transportation industry 
external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of independent inland tank barge operators and fleet owners seeking to single source tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargos  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power  minimal incremental administrative staff and less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargos 
the company anticipates that during  the us and global economies will remain stable with continued strong demand for the transportation services of the marine transportation segment 
in  some incremental capacity was added to the industry fleet and the company anticipates some additional capacity will be added during critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectable receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectable amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectable amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  a significant change in the level of uncollectable amounts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
routine maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred on an annual basis 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 

table of contents although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance 
acquisitions on march   the company purchased from pfc the remaining interest in dixie fuels for  subject to post closing working capital adjustments and drydocking expenditures 
the dixie fuels partnership  formed in  was owned by pfc and owned by the company 
in addition  the company extended the expiration date of its marine transportation contract with pfc from to revenues for dixie fuels for were approximately  on december   the company purchased the diesel engine services division of teco for  in cash 
in addition  the company entered into a contract to provide diesel engine services to teco 
on june   the company purchased acl s black oil products fleet of inland tank barges for  in cash 
five of the barges are currently in service and the other five are being renovated in on april   the company purchased a one third interest in osprey for  the purchase price consisted of cash of  and notes payable of  due and paid in april the remaining two thirds interest was owned by cooper t

revenues for osprey for were approximately on april   the company purchased from walker  a subsidiary of ingram  walker s diesel engine service operations and parts inventory located in paducah  kentucky for  in cash 
in addition  the company entered into a contract to provide diesel engine services to ingram 
on january   the company purchased from seariver  the us transportation affiliate of exxonmobil  double hull inland tank barges and seven inland towboats for  in cash  and assumed from seariver the leases of double hull inland tank barges 
on february   the company purchased three double hull inland tank barges leased by seariver from banc of america leasing for  in cash

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating a current fleet of active inland tank barges and active inland towing vessels  transporting petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals along the united states inland waterways 
during  and  the marine transportation segment was also the managing partner of a owned offshore marine partnership  consisting of four dry bulk barge and tug units 
the partnership was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the following table sets forth the company s marine transportation segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to marine transportation revenues costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses selling  general and administrative taxes  other than on income depreciation and amortization operating income operating margins compared with marine transportation revenues marine transportation revenues for increased compared with  reflecting continued strong petrochemical and black oil products demand 
in addition  the segment benefited from contract and spot market increases  term contract fuel adjustments  as well as labor and consumer price index escalators effective january  on numerous multi year contracts 
the year was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita  more fully described below 
the company estimates that the two back to back gulf coast hurricanes negatively impacted the third quarter and year by 
per share 

table of contents petrochemical transportation demand during remained strong as term contract customers continued to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates  resulting in high barge utilization for most products and trade lanes 
black oil products demand during was strong as refineries operated at close to full capacity  which generated demand for waterborne transportation of heavier refinery residual oil by products 
refined petroleum products volumes transported in the midwest during were generally at lower winter weather levels in the first quarter  higher levels in the second and third quarter with the summer driving season and slightly lower in the fourth quarter 
the company s presence in the refined petroleum products market was reduced during as barges were diverted to the stronger gulf intracoastal waterway petrochemical market to meet term contract requirements 
in addition  over the past several years  the company s refined petroleum products tank barge capacity has been reduced by the company s continued retirement of its single hull barges 
agricultural demand was seasonally strong during  the result of favorable demand for the movement of imported liquid fertilizer products into the midwest and south texas 
the company incurred a record  delay days during  an increase over the record  delay days incurred during delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and one or more barges during transit 
the measure includes transit delays caused by weather  lock congestion or closure and other adverse navigating conditions 
during january  the company experienced high water conditions on the ohio and illinois rivers and the run off of these rivers caused high water conditions on the lower mississippi river in late january and early february 
in addition  the upper ohio river was closed for two weeks in january due to an accident at the belleville lock 
during january and february  the company also encountered numerous fog days along the gulf coast 
these inclement weather conditions and lock closures resulted in longer transit times  which delayed customer deliveries and created operating inefficiencies 
during march  weather conditions throughout the mississippi river system and the gulf intracoastal waterway improved significantly  allowing the company to efficiently meet the current demand  as well as the backlog from february 
weather conditions during the second quarter  july and the majority of august were also favorable  allowing for better asset utilization through faster barge turnarounds and more efficient use of horsepower 
hurricanes katrina and rita negatively impacted the company s operations and its financial results by an estimated 
per share 
hurricane katrina made landfall east of new orleans on august and hurricane rita made landfall on the texas louisiana border on september petrochemical and refinery facilities located in the paths or projected paths of the hurricanes shutdown operations in advance of the storms 
waterways in the hurricane affected areas were closed and the company s equipment was moved out of the path of the storms or into protected areas 
the hurricanes caused no injuries to the company s vessel crews and no notable damage to the company s tank barge and towboat fleet or its facilities 
all waterways in the hurricane affected areas were closed for a limited number of days and a majority of the petrochemical and refinery facilities impacted by the hurricanes resumed full production within a matter of weeks 
the impact of the hurricanes was mitigated to some degree by risk sharing provisions in many of the company s contracts  enabling the company to recover some of the costs related to navigational delays beyond the company s control 
in addition  some customers opted to place equipment on a time charter basis prior to the hurricanes and remained on charter through the storms 
during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues 
the contract and spot market mix provides the company with a stable revenue stream with less exposure to day to day pricing fluctuations

in addition  the year reflected the full first quarter impact of the january  purchase of the inland tank barge fleet of seariver 
petrochemical volumes transported were strong for all of  due primarily to the improved us and global economies 
contract customers operated their plants at high utilization rates throughout  resulting in high barge utilization for most products and trade lanes 
black oil volumes during were higher than  reflecting increased refinery production generating demand for waterborne transportation of heavier refinery residual oil by products 
in addition  the continued high natural gas prices during resulted in the continued use of residual fuel as a substitute for natural gas for the production of refined products 

table of contents refined products volumes transported into the midwest from the gulf coast during were generally at normal seasonal levels  with demand stronger in april through august  the typical summer driving season 
agricultural chemical volumes were weak throughout  with some improvement in the fourth quarter 
high midwest inventory levels and high product prices during the first six months caused volumes to be weak 
during the third quarter  despite low midwest inventory levels  volumes transported were reduced from levels as high prices for liquid fertilizer products curtailed demand 
the company incurred a record  delay days during  a increase over  delay days incurred in the delay days included the closure of a major lock for repair on the gulf intracoastal waterway in may and the closure of a major lock on the ohio river for repair in august 
the delay days also included high water conditions  principally during the second and fourth quarters  a significant number of fog days along the gulf coast in the first and fourth quarters  and hurricane ivan in september 
hurricane ivan  which made landfall near gulf shores  alabama on september   adversely affected the company s operations 
the initial projected path was from new orleans to the florida panhandle
