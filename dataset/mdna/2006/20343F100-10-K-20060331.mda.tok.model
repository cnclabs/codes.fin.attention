net interest income for increased by  over the amount due to increases of  and  in interest income on loans and investment securities  respectively  and decreases of  and  in interest expenses related to time deposits and short term borrowings  respectively 
interest expense for long term debt increased by  in  primarily due to the issuance of  of junior subordinated debt by the corporation credit quality issues in and the greatest single factor in changing net income in and was the tremendous increase in the provisions for loan losses 
in the provision was  and in it was  this compares to  in   in and  in more than of the provisions made in and were attributable to credit quality issues at one of the corporation s subsidiary banks 
the corporation became aware of credit quality issues at the bank in mid in connection with the departure of a senior lending officer of the bank 
management initially became aware of a number of loans with significant issues and began a program to strengthen and collect those loans 
that program was only partially successful as some of the borrowers financial conditions and value of collateral deteriorated during collection efforts 
the corporation also realized that it would benefit from strengthening its credit risk management system 
in that effort was carried out by redirecting the corporation s existing capabilities to focus on the bank in question 
as part of the ongoing process of risk assessment and mitigation  management hired a chief credit officer for the corporation early in the second quarter of also  during the second quarter of management changed its outside independent loan review firm to gain greater resources and expertise 
the changes allowed the corporation to obtain the benefits of detailed  thorough reviews of a greater portion of its loan portfolio in a shorter time period than had previously been possible 
during the independent loan review firm reviewed all of the corporation s loan relationships greater than  approximately of loans outstanding 
their review resulted in the movement of a significant number and dollar amount of loans into less favorable risk grades 
in such cases  management also undertook a review of the value of any collateral securing the loans to estimate the net realizable value of the collateral in the event of a default 
in some cases  management concluded that it was probable that the corporation would be unable to collect the amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and categorized those loans as impaired 
in other cases  the downgraded loans were designated as potential problem loans 
although designation as a potential problem loan does not represent management s estimate that the corporation will suffer a loss with respect to the loan  it does identify loans that merit close attention to reduce the risk of loss 
the corporation is required to estimate the collectibility of its loan portfolio as of each accounting period end and  as a result  provide an allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged to expense and by any recoveries received on loans previously charged off 
the allowance is decreased by deducting the amount of uncollectible loans charged off 
the reviews referred to above were factored into management s estimates of the probable losses inherent in the corporation s loan portfolio at december  and and resulted in substantial increases in the amount of the allowance at each of those dates which  in turn  was substantially responsible for the very large provisions for loan losses recorded in and at year end  approximately of the corporation s impaired loans and of the potential problem loans were associated with the same bank subsidiary  although that bank accounted for only of the corporation s total loans 
over the course of  management of the corporation took a number of additional actions to improve credit risk management at that subsidiary 
these included more aggressive review of maturing loans to improve the bank s collateral position and the borrowers ability to service the debt  the hiring of an experienced special assets officer on a contract basis  under the supervision of the chief credit officer  to work out problem loans  a more frequent level of loan review conducted by the external loan review firm  and a mandatory loan approval review of larger loan relationships conducted by the chief credit officer as well as the loan committee of the bank 
management believes that this will result in a significant improvement in the early identification of problem and potential problem loans and it will also improve the quality of new loans 
additional information about the corporation s provision for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  impaired loans and potential problem loans is discussed under the heading allowance for loan losses  below 
net interest income net interest income  the difference between interest income earned and interest expense incurred  is the principal source of the corporation s earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the levels of interest rates and by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
beginning in mid and continuing throughout  the federal reserve board steadily increased certain short term interest rates under its control 
these actions resulted in similar increases in other market rates of interest  primarily in the short and intermediate terms up to about seven years 
longer term rates remained at approximately the same levels as previously 
these actions affected cbi in several ways loan yields and interest costs increased as interest rates on loans with variable interest rates were reset and maturing time deposits and newly acquired time deposits were priced at current market levels  savings  now and money market rates were adjusted upward primarily in response to market competition for deposits  and borrowing costs increased as rates associated with those instruments moved higher 
because longer term rates were largely unaffected by the federal reserve board s actions  especially those in the to year range which largely influences mortgage rates  the mortgage subsidiary experienced a resurgence in demand during consequently  fees and other mortgage brokerage income items were favorably affected 
from and through the first six months of  market interest rates were generally stable 
beginning in and continuing until late in the second quarter of  the federal reserve board s policy was to provide stimulus to the us economy by first setting  and then maintaining  interest rates at low levels 
the effects of these actions on the corporation were varied 
the corporation s overall funding costs decreased during the period  but there were similar decreases in the yields realized on loans and investments 
the mortgage subsidiary experienced extremely large volumes of originations and refinancing activity  which strained its ability both to fund and to process those transactions until the volume diminished in the fourth quarter of refinancing activity during the first six months of was driven primarily by uncertainty and concern about whether the federal reserve board would begin to cause interest rates to rise  and  if so  the magnitude and timing of those increases 
net interest income was   and  for   and  respectively 
the amounts of interest income increased in both and  and interest expense amounts increased in and decreased in average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities amounts increased steadily over those two years  also

nonaccruing loans are included in the average balances and income from such loans is recognized on a cash basis 
interest income includes immateral amounts of loan fees 
total interest earning assets yield less total interest bearing liabilities rate 
net yield equals net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 
during  loans  including loans held for sale  grew  over the amount as of december  average loans including loans held for sale  however  were  more in than in and represented almost all of the increase in average total interest earning assets during deposit growth was robust in  as well  with the year end amount increasing by  over the year end  and the average amount of deposits increasing by  for over the comparable amount 
deposits are generally obtained from within the banks market areas 
although some of the banks obtain limited amounts of deposit funding through the use of brokered time deposits  the amounts of such deposits do not create significant liquidity concerns for the affected banks 
the banks have recently begun accepting health savings account deposits as an additional product offering  but the amounts of such deposits are not yet significant 
interest costs associated with deposits increased primarily due to increased market rates 
by year end compared with  gross loans grew  while deposits grew  because the growth in deposit liabilities in was not sufficient to fund the corporation s growth in loans  management took several actions 
early in the second quarter of  the corporation issued approximately  in long term junior subordinated debt to provide additional capital to some of the banking subsidiaries and to provide a more stable funding source for its mortgage banking operations 
as a result  the corporation reduced its reliance on short term  relatively high cost borrowings in the corporation continues to maintain a short term line of credit with another financial institution which can be used to fund surges in mortgage loan demand 
the corporation also changed its allocation of assets such that its investments in federal funds sold and securities available for sale decreased significantly by the end of compared with this also allowed the corporation to invest significantly more dollars in the higher yielding loan asset category 
time deposits are the largest category of the corporation s deposit liabilities 
interest rates paid for such liabilities increased during accordingly  total interest expense reversed its recent trend and increased to  in from  in and  in the average rates paid for time deposits increased to in from in and in interest expenses for short term borrowings were largely unchanged in  primarily due to the lower average amounts of that funding source 
long term debt is composed of fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and variable rate junior subordinated debt 
until short term interest rate increases cease  the corporation expects that its interest expenses will continue to increase  as well 
the table volume and rate variance analysis provides a summary of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and changes in rate 
the changes in volume are the difference between the current and prior year s balances multiplied by the prior year s rate 
the changes in rate are the difference between the current and prior year s rate multiplied by the prior year s balance 
as shown in the table  the increases in net interest income during each of the past two years primarily are due to higher volumes of earning assets 
in addition  by moving quickly to increase yields on interest earning assets during while limiting increases in rates paid  the corporation was able to obtain favorable results from the rate component  as well 
loan growth has been prominent in contributing to increases in interest income

in such cases  the entire variance is attributed to volume variance 
although management currently expects that interest rates will continue to increase in  management has not presently identified any factors that it believes might cause interest rates to increase sharply in a short period of time 
however  changes in interest rates that can significantly affect the corporation  positively or negatively  are possible 
in the absence of significant changes in market interest rate levels  any significant changes in net interest income during are expected to result from changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and liabilities 
management expects to continue using its marketing strategies to increase the corporation s market share of both deposits and quality loans within its market areas 
these strategies involve offering attractive interest rates and outstanding customer service 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio and its estimate of the adequacy of the related allowance for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net charge offs for were  compared with  and  for and  respectively 
during the second half of  management became aware of credit quality concerns relative to the loan portfolio of one of its subsidiary banks and a  real estate secured loan at another of its subsidiary banks 
consequently  during that period significant increases were recorded in the corporation s loan loss provision resulting in an overall provision of  for the year 
in  the corporation s external loan review firm reviewed the larger loan relationships at the subsidiary bank with credit quality concerns about its loan portfolio 
based on those reviews  and further analysis and review conducted by management  significant increases were recorded in the corporation s loan loss provision during the last two quarters of this resulted in a provision of  for the year so that  in the opinion of management  the allowance for loan losses would be adequate to absorb the probable losses remaining in the loan portfolio 
because of personnel changes as well as the corporation s upgrading of its credit risk management systems  management does not believe that the magnitude of the provisions for loan losses in and represent a trend  although it realizes that the level of provisions may remain somewhat above levels as the problem loans and potential problem loans which contributed to the high level of provisions in and are finally resolved 
see impaired loans  potential problem loans  allowance for loan losses  and the application of critical accounting policies for further discussion of the loans and provisions for loan losses referenced above and a discussion of the methodology used and the factors considered by management in its estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income noninterest income for increased by  or over the amount  primarily as a result of increased mortgage brokerage income 
interest rates associated with mortgage loans did not change significantly in  and the demand for housing in the corporation s market areas remains strong 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by  in due to increased management oversight of fee waivers and changes in the fee structure 
noninterest income for decreased by  or from  primarily due to a  or decrease in mortgage brokerage income 
this decrease resulted from a mortgage industry wide slowdown in refinancing activity in the corporation inititated measures early in the second quarter of to decrease the costs and complexity of funding the mortgage brokerage operation 
those measures included establishing crm as a loan production office of one of its subsidiary banks  closing loans in the bank s name  and assigning the loan back to crm upon the loans sale into the secondary market 
management estimates that the process resulted in cost savings of approximately  for the corporation over the final three quarters of service charges on deposit accounts were  lower in than in this resulted from a slight decrease in the volume of returned check charges and a slowing in demand for the automated overdraft service 
during  gains on the sale of investment securities totaled  compared with losses of  in noninterest expenses noninterest expense for increased by  or over the amount 
higher salaries and employee benefits expenses were largely responsible for this increase 
these items increased by  primarily due to the operation of an additional office of florence national bank in  higher commissions and bonuses paid by the mortgage subsidiary  and the hiring of a new chief executive officer  a chief credit officer  and a human resources director 
expenses related to premises and equipment increased in by  over the amount due to higher depreciation expenses that resulted from an additional office of florence national bank and equipment purchased and placed in service during the year 
construction of a new headquarters office and operations building was completed during the fourth quarter of and the building was placed in service in the first quarter of the corporation recorded  in relocation expenses in for moving to the new building 
noninterest expenses for decreased by  or from the amount  primarily due to lower expenses for salaries and employee benefits 
such expenses were reduced primarily because of the decline in mortgage loan originations resulting in less commission expense 
income taxes income tax expense for was  a decrease of  or from  recorded for income tax expense for decreased  or from the amount 
the decreasing income tax expense amounts resulted directly from the lower amounts of income before income taxes during and the effective income tax rate income tax expense divided by income before income taxes was   and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for is abnormally high because south carolina requires that each of the four subsidiary banks file a separate income tax return 
one of the subsidiary banks recorded a loss for south carolina bank tax is based on a bank s net income for financial reporting purposes but does not provide any offsetting benefit for operating losses 
investment portfolio the corporation s investment portfolio consists primarily of short and intermediate term us treasury and us government agency debt issues

maturity category based on final stated maturity dates 
average maturity is expected to be substantially shorter because of the monthly return of principal on certain securities 
on an ongoing basis  management assigns securities upon purchase into one of two categories available for sale or held to maturity based on intent  taking into consideration other factors including expectations for changes in market rates of interest  liquidity needs  asset liability management strategies  and capital requirements 
the corporation has never held securities for trading purposes 
no transfers of available for sale or held to maturity securities to other categories were made in any of the years through during  the composition of the securities portfolio was little changed 
the amount of securities held at the end of was only  more than the amount held at the end of purchases for the securities accounts during were generally made to replace issues called or matured during the year 
securities purchased had maturities ranging from approximately two years to approximately eight years in the future 
during  management changed the composition of the securities portfolio  primarily by decreasing the amounts invested in securities throughout the year 
despite investment securities being larger in average amount in  the corporation s investment in such instruments at december  was  less than at december  proceeds from sales and calls of investment securities and reductions in federal funds sold were used  in part  to fund loan growth in excess of the growth in deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
during the years ended december   and  the corporation sold investment securities for gross proceeds of   and  respectively 
realized losses and gains on those transactions were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
securities may be sold to provide liquidity  to reduce interest rate risk  or for other reasons 
there were no sales of held to maturity securities in any of the periods presented 
all mortgage backed securities held by the corporation were issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation  the federal national mortgage association or the government national mortgage association 
loan portfolio management believes the loan portfolio is adequately diversified 
there are no significant concentrations of loans in any particular individual  industry or groups of related individuals or industries  and there are no foreign loans 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category loan portfolio composition december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      consumer installment      total loans gross      commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  primarily representing loans made to small and medium size businesses  may be made on either a secured or an unsecured basis 
when taken  security usually consists of liens on inventories  receivables  equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
unsecured business loans are generally short term with emphasis on repayment strengths and low debt to worth ratios 
commercial lending involves significant risk because repayment usually depends on the cash flows generated by a borrower s business  and debt service capacity can deteriorate because of downturns in national and local economic conditions 
each of the banking subsidiaries has a loan committee which is responsible for overseeing the credit granting and monitoring processes 
the corporation s chief credit officer has specific authority over significantly large loan requests 
real estate loans consist of construction loans and other loans secured by mortgages 
because the corporation s subsidiaries are community banks  real estate loans comprise the bulk of the loan portfolio 
loan policies of the subsidiary banks generally limit loan to value ratios for real estate loans to the banks generally do not compete with and year fixed rate secondary market mortgage interest rates  so they have elected to pursue the origination of mortgage loans that could easily be sold into the secondary mortgage market 
crm also originates such loans for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are generally pre qualified with various underwriters to facilitate the sales process 
in  and  the corporation sold   and  respectively  of such loans 
the corporation s subsidiaries may originate mortgage loans for their own loan portfolios 
such loans are usually for a shorter term than loans originated to sell and usually have a variable rate or the terms of the loans require that the interest rate be adjusted to the current market rate within a three to five year term 
consumer installment loans to individuals are generally for personal  automobile  or household purposes and may be secured or unsecured 
the corporation has a geographic concentration of loans within the banks market areas because of the nature of its business 
as of december   the corporation had no other significant concentrations of credit to customers engaged in similar business activities 
unsecured loans the corporation does not aggressively seek to make unsecured loans  since these loans may be somewhat more risky than collateralized loans 
there are  however  occasions when it is in the business interests of the corporation to provide short term  unsecured loans to its most credit worthy customers 
unsecured loans accommodate the credit needs of those customers and provide the banks the opportunity to earn additional interest income through pricing commensurate with the loans increased risk 
at december   the corporation had approximately  or of its loan portfolio  in unsecured loans 
as of december   the corporation had approximately  in unsecured loans  or of its loan portfolio 
such loans are made on the basis of management s evaluation of the customer s ability to repay and net worth 
as of december   unsecured loans totaling  were included in nonaccrual loans   of such loans were included in accruing loans or more days past due  and  of such loans were included in potential problem loans

loans which management has identified as impaired generally are nonaccrual loans

no cash basis interest income was recognized in  and on non accrual loans 
the corporation s accounting policies on nonaccrual and impaired loans are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
potential problem loans  a lower level of concern than impaired and nonperforming loans  are defined as loans where information about the borrowers credit problems causes management to have more than normal concern about the borrowers ability to comply with the original repayment terms

approximately  of the december  and nonperforming loan amounts represent the balance of a loan relationship that originated in july to finance the purchase of a business 
during the fourth quarter of  management became aware that the business was not performing as expected and the borrower stopped making the required payments 
the borrower alleged that financial information furnished by the seller and relied upon in establishing the value of the business and its purchase price was fraudulent 
management determined during the fourth quarter of that the loan had become collateral dependent and wrote the loan down to the estimated net realizable value of the collateral as of december  an independent appraisal of the real estate  fixtures and equipment of the business was completed during the second quarter of under the assumption that the business was not operating as a going concern 
that appraisal supports management s estimated net realizable value and the loan s carrying amount has not since changed 
the corporation is presently exercising forbearance with respect to this relationship and continues to work with the borrower who is actively trying to sell the business as a going concern 
management has retained legal counsel to assist with respect to this loan 
the other nonperforming loans consist of approximately loans to various individuals and businesses with an aggregate balance of  the amounts of the individual loans range up to approximately  approximately  of the increase in nonaccrual loans during the third quarter of represents larger loan relationships that were transferred from the potential problem loan category as the borrowers failures to meet their obligations became more severe 
in addition  current evaluations of the collateral held indicated potential short falls in those values 
during the fourth quarter of  approximately  of loans were added to nonaccrual loans due to performance issues and or as a result of continuing reviews of the loan portfolio  including valuations of collateral 
charge offs of loans from the nonaccrual category approximated  during the fourth quarter of loans that are days or more past due and still accruing interest represent loans with significant performance issues  but where management believes that each loan s collateral position provides enough protection that the bank expects full recovery of principal and interest on the loan 
at december  this category represented approximately 
of the loan portfolio 
at december   the corporation had identified  or  of the loan portfolio  as potential problem loans 
this is an increase of  over the amount as of december  approximately  or of this increase in potential problem loans resulted from risk grade changes recommended by a new loan review firm during their initial loan portfolio reviews in and management initiated loan downgrades 
approximately  or of this increase in potential problem loans resulted from a consumer loan portfolio credit scoring project conducted during the fourth quarter by management at the banking subsidiary most impacted by problem loans 
the amount of potential problem loans does not represent management s estimate of potential losses since a significant portion of these loans are secured by real estate and other forms of collateral 
approximately  of potential problem loans were unsecured as of december  management will continue to closely monitor the levels of nonperforming and potential problem loans and address the weaknesses in those credits to enhance the amount of ultimate collection or recovery of these assets 
foreclosed assets foreclosed assets were carried in the consolidated balance sheets at   and  as of december   and  respectively 
foreclosed assets are initially recorded at fair value  less estimated costs to sell  at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
loan losses arising from the acquisition of such property are charged against the allowance for loan losses as of that date 
subsequent to foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management and the assets are carried at the lower of the new cost basis or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
revenues and expenses from operations and changes in any subsequent valuation allowance are included in net foreclosed assets costs and expenses 
special assets management in late management hired an experienced special assets officer on a contract basis 
the initial term of his agreement with the corporation is through june  under the direction and supervision of the chief credit officer  he will assist in working to aggressively reduce the aggregate level of problem loans through all appropriate banking and legal options

the corporation operates four independent community banks in south carolina 
under the provisions of law and regulations governing banks  each bank s board of directors is responsible for determining the adequacy of its bank s loan loss allowance 
in addition  each bank is supervised and regularly examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ or the south carolina state board of financial institutions the state board in the case of the ridgeway bank or the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
as a normal part of a safety and soundness examination  bank examiners assess and comment on the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses and may require that changes be made in the allowance 
the allowance presented in the consolidated financial statements is on an aggregated basis and as such might differ from the allowance that would be presented if the corporation had only one banking subsidiary 
a considerable degree of judgment is exercised in computing an estimate of the allowance for loan losses 
management s judgment must be applied in assessing the current creditworthiness of borrowers and in estimating uncertain future events and their effects based on currently known facts and circumstances 
changes in the estimated allowance for loan losses arising as new events occur or more information is obtained are accounted for as changes in accounting estimates in the accounting period in which such changes occur 
management reviews its allowance for loan losses utilizing three broad loan categories commercial  real estate and consumer installment loans to individuals 
within these categories  the allowance for loan losses is composed of specific and general amounts 
specific allowance amounts are provided for individual loans based on management s evaluation of loss exposure taking into account the current payment status  underlying collateral and other known information about the borrower s circumstances 
typically  these loans are identified as impaired or nonperforming  or have been assigned internal risk grades of management attention  special mention  substandard or doubtful 
general allowance amounts are provided for all other loans  excluding those for which specific amounts were determined  by applying estimated loss percentages to the portfolio categorized using risk grades 
these percentages are based on management s current evaluation with consideration given to historical loss experience  general national and local economic and business conditions affecting key lending market areas  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes  portfolio seasoning  and any identified credit concentrations 
the findings of internal and external credit reviews and results from external audits and regulatory examinations are also considered 
the following table presents the allocation of the corporation s allowance for loan losses  as of december  through  compared with the percentage of loans in the applicable categories to total loans

this system involves the lending officers assigning a risk grade  on a loan by loan basis  considering information about the borrower s capacity to repay  collateral  payment history  and other known factors 
assigned risk grades are updated monthly for any known changes in circumstances affecting the borrower or the loan 
the risk grading system is monitored on a continuing basis by management and the external credit review firm which is independent of the lending function 
the following discussion presents specific factors that influenced management s judgment of the amounts of additions to the allowance through provisions charged to operating expenses for each of the years presented in the table 
in   was provided for loan losses for normally expected loan loss expense and due to significant growth in the loan portfolio during that year and the expectation that the loans booked in the newer florence market could exhibit a higher loss potential than the corporation s older markets 
in   was provided for loan losses due to growth in the loan portfolio totaling  of which approximately  was obtained in the merger of ridgeway bankshares  inc furthermore  net charge offs almost tripled compared with the prior year and an increase of  was noted in the combined amounts of nonaccrual loans  accruing loans or more days past due  and potential problem loans 
in   was provided for loan losses  primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio and a significant increase in the amount of nonaccrual loans 
the  and  provisions for loan losses recorded for and  respectively  resulted from the circumstances detailed above 
deposits the average deposits for the corporation for the years ended december   and are summarized below years ended december  average average average average average average balance cost balance cost balance cost dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand    interest bearing transaction accounts    savings regular    savings money market    time deposits less than    time deposits greater than    total average deposits    deposits are the primary source of funds for the banks lending and investing activities 
deposits are attracted principally from customers within the banks local market areas through the offering of a variety of products with varying features and by offering competitive interest rates 
at december  the corporation had  in certificates of deposit of  or more 
approximately  mature within three months   mature over three through six months   mature over six months through twelve months and  mature after one year 
this level of large time deposits  as well as the growth in other deposits  can be attributed to planned growth by management 
the majority of time deposits  and over is acquired within the company s market areas in the ordinary course of business from customers with standing banking relationships 
however  as of december   the banks had  in brokered certificates of deposit  all of which were issued in denominations of  or over 
the brokered certificates of deposit mature throughout and have interest rates ranging from to 
it is a common industry practice not to consider time deposits of  or more as core deposits since their retention can be influenced heavily by rates offered 
therefore  such deposits have the characteristics of shorter term purchased funds 
certificates of deposit  and over require that the corporation achieve and maintain an appropriate matching of maturity distributions and a diversification of sources to achieve an appropriate level of liquidity 
short term borrowings the corporation s short term borrowings may consist of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which generally have maturities ranging from daily to no more than four days  and mortgage loan warehouse and general purpose lines of credit payable 
as of december   securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled  these amounts are collateralized by investment securities and the interest rate is subject to change daily 
federal funds purchased totaled  as of december   are unsecured and mature on a daily basis 
 was outstanding under warehouse lines of credit as of december  other short term debt was outstanding on december  under an unsecured short term credit facility granted to the corporation by another financial institution 
that variable rate facility expires during the fourth quarter of summary information about total short term borrowings is provided in the following table 
december  dollars in thousands balance outstanding at end of year    weighted average interest rate at end of the period interest expense maximum outstanding at any month end during the period    average outstanding during the period    weighted average interest rate during the period long term debt the corporation s banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
as such  they have access to long term borrowing from the fhlb 
as of december   the banks had borrowed a total of  from the fhlb 
the borrowings are secured by blanket liens on all qualifying first lien residential mortgage loans held by the banks  specifically excluding such loans originated for resale on the secondary market 
early in the second quarter of  the corporation sponsored the creation of scb capital trust i the trust 
the trust issued securities totaling  the trust invested the proceeds of its debt issuance by purchasing a like amount of junior subordinated debt issued by the corporation 
the amount of the corporation s debt is includible in tier capital for purposes of computing regulatory required capital ratios 
return on equity and assets the following table shows the return on assets net income divided by average total assets  return on equity net income divided by average equity  dividend payout ratio dividends declared per share divided by net income per share  and equity to assets ratio average equity divided by average total assets for the years ended december   and years ended december  return on assets roa return on equity roe dividend payout ratio equity as a percent of assets liquidity liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations through liquidation or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional liabilities 
adequate liquidity is necessary to meet the requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals in a timely and economical manner 
the most manageable sources of liquidity are composed of liabilities  with the primary focus of liquidity management being on the ability to attract deposits within the banks market areas 
core deposits total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more provide a relatively stable funding base 
certificates of deposit of  or more are generally more sensitive to changes in rates  so they must be monitored carefully 
asset liquidity is provided by several sources  including amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  and investments available for sale 
the corporation maintains an available for sale investment securities portfolio 
while investment securities purchased for this portfolio are generally purchased with the intent to be held to maturity  such securities are marketable and occasional sales may occur prior to maturity as part of the process of asset liability and liquidity management 
the corporation also occasionally designates securities as held to maturity 
securities in that portion of the portfolio are generally not considered a primary source of liquidity 
management deliberately maintains a relatively short term maturity schedule for its investments so that there is a continuing stream of maturing investments that enables the corporation to supply liquidity to its loan portfolio and for customer withdrawals 
in addition  to the extent that the corporation must maintain continuing positions in investment securities due to pledging or other requirements  regular periodic maturities of investments helps to ensure that the corporation invests funds throughout periods of changing rates which tends to mitigate the effects such changes have on the fair values of investment securities 
the corporation has substantially more liabilities maturing in the next months than it has assets maturing in the same period 
the corporation also has legal obligations to extend credit pursuant to loan commitments  lines of credit and standby letters of credit which totaled   and  respectively  at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  based on its historical experience  and that of similar companies  the corporation believes that it is unlikely that so many deposits would be withdrawn  without being replaced by other deposits  and extensions of credit would be required  that the corporation would be unable to meet its liquidity needs with the proceeds of maturing assets  in the ordinary course of business 
the corporation also maintains various federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks and is able to borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve s discount window 
the corporation  through its banks  has a demonstrated ability to attract deposits from its market area 
deposits grew from  as of december  to  as of december   a five year compound growth rate of 
this consistently growing base of deposits is the major source of operating liquidity 
capital dividends the corporation exists as a legal entity distinct from its subsidiaries 
its main sources of revenues consist of service fees and dividends paid to it by the banks 
the banks are subject to various laws and regulations that limit the amounts of dividends that they may pay 
in addition  the corporation and the banks are each subject to regulatory minimum capital adequacy guidelines 
these regulatory restrictions have not historically hindered the corporation s or the banks ability to pay reasonable dividends and no such restrictions are anticipated in during  the corporation contributed  of capital to two of the banks and received dividends from the other banks totaling  subject to restrictions imposed by state laws and federal regulations  the boards of directors of the banks could have declared additional dividends from their retained earnings of up to approximately  as of december  as of january   the effect of those restrictions was to further restrict the amount of dividends that the banks could declare to  the corporation made dividend payments to shareholders of   and  during  and  respectively 
capital adequacy the federal reserve and federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted risk based capital standards for assessing the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and financial institutions 
under the risk based capital requirements  the corporation and each of the banks are required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet activities  such as letters of credit of 
at least half of total capital must be composed of common equity  retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock and certain hybrid instruments  less certain intangibles tier capital 
the remainder may consist of certain subordinated debt or hybrid capital instruments  qualified preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses tier capital  which  along with tier capital  composes total capital 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities generally are excluded from the calculation of the risk based capital ratios 
to be considered well capitalized under the risk based capital guidelines  an institution must maintain a total risk weighted capital ratio of at least and a tier risk weighted ratio of at least 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies also has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banking organizations 
pursuant to these requirements  banking organizations generally must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets equal to from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of the institution s overall safety and soundness 
federal regulators may categorize an institution as less than well capitalized based on subjective criteria 
management believes that there are no conditions or events that would cause the corporation s or the banks capital category to be other than resulting from meeting the minimum ratio requirements 
under the risk based capital standards and pursuant to the provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  federal bank regulatory agencies are required to implement prescribed prompt corrective actions if an institution s capital position deteriorates to specified levels 
the corrective actions become increasingly stringent as the capital position continues to deteriorate 
the banks are each considered to be well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
detailed information on the corporation s and the banks capital positions can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the mortgage subsidiary is also subject to minimum capital requirements to maintain its certification as a hud approved title ii loan correspondent 
certain investor and warehouse credit line agreements require that the mortgage subsidiary maintain its hud certification 
failure of crm to meet its capital requirements could result in a significant limitation of the mortgage subsidiary s ability to originate  fund or sell loans  and therefore could have a direct  material adverse effect on its business and the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   crm exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirement by approximately  during the first quarter of  the corporation acquired  in proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debt 
of this amount   was used to provide additional capital to two of the banks  approximately  was used to repay a short term line of credit of the mortgage subsidiary and approximately  was used to repay the corporation s short term borrowings 
the remainder is being used for the corporation s general corporate purposes 
under current federal reserve policy  the corporation is allowed to treat the junior subordinated debt  subject to certain limitations  as tier capital for capital adequacy purposes 
inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are mostly monetary in nature 
accordingly  the financial results and operations of the corporation are much more affected by changes in interest rates than changes in inflation 
there is  however  a strong correlation between increasing inflation and increasing interest rates 
the rate of inflation  as measured by the average change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers  has been moderate  but increasing  over the past several years  about in  in and in prospects appear reasonable for continued moderate inflation  despite risks related to energy prices and the political and military situation in the middle east 
although inflation does not normally affect a financial institution as dramatically as it does businesses with large investments in plants and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation there are usually corresponding increases in the money supply and banks experience above average growth in assets  loans  and deposits 
general increases in the prices of goods and services also result in increased operating expenses 
further  inflation may adversely affect the corporation s customers and indirectly affect the business of the corporation 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the corporation presently only engages in limited off balance sheet arrangements 
such arrangements are defined as potentially material transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements which the corporation has entered into to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party and  under which the corporation  whether or not it is a party to the arrangement  has  or in the future may have o any obligation under a direct or indirect guarantee or similar arrangement  o a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets  o derivatives  to the extent that the fair value thereof is not fully reflected as a liability or asset in the financial statements  or o any obligation  including a contingent obligation  arising out of a variable interest as referenced in fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities january  as may be modified or supplemented  in an unconsolidated entity that is held by  and material to  the registrant  where such entity provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with  the corporation 
the corporation s off balance sheet arrangements presently include only commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
such instruments have elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to these instruments is represented by the contractual  or notional  amount of those instruments 
generally  the same credit policies used for on balance sheet instruments  such as loans  are used in extending loan commitments and letters of credit 
the following table sets out the contractual or notional amounts of those arrangements december  dollars in thousands loan commitments   unfunded commitments under lines of credit   standby letters of credit   loan commitments involve agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and some involve payment of a fee 
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn  therefore  the total amount of loan commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
each customer s creditworthiness is evaluated on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if any  upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies but may include commercial and residential real properties  accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is the same as that involved in making loan commitments to customers 
as described under liquidity  management believes that its various sources of liquidity provide the resources necessary for the banks to fund the loan commitments and to perform under standby letters of credit  if the need arises 
neither the company nor the banks are involved in other off balance sheet contractual relationships or transactions that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments or significantly impact earnings 
the corporation s contractual cash obligations are summarized in the following table 
december  payments due by period less than total year to years to years after years dollars in thousands contractual cash obligations time deposits     long term debt     operating lease obligations   total      the application of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
management believes that the policy relating to the allowance for loan losses discussed in the section entitled allowance for loan losses may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in its application and represents the critical accounting policy used in the preparation of the corporation s financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the reported results 
impact of recent accounting changes share based payment management adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective january   as required under the provisions of that statement and applicable securities and exchange sec commission rules 
that statement requires that stock based compensation awards be measured and reported at their grant date fair value  with their costs recognized generally over the vesting period of the awards 
the fair value of such stock based awards is affected by the company s stock price and by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
in addition  in march   the securities and exchange commission issued its staff accounting bulletin no 
which expresses the views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
the provisions of  and guidance provided in  sab no 
will be incorporated into the company s implementation of sfas no 
r 
the company will recognize the compensation cost for stock based awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award and at present intends to use the modified prospective transition method of accounting for previously issued stock options 
accordingly  only costs associated with the unvested portions of prior awards and awards granted after december  will affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
all of the options previously granted by the corporation were vested as of december   therefore  no compensation expense is expected to be recognized in the future for previously awarded stock options 
sfas r also amends sfas no 
to require that excess tax benefits resulting from those transactions be reported as financing cash flows rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
management expects that adoption of sfas no 
r will affect the company s future net income and net income per share calculations in much the same manner as previously reported in the pro forma disclosures as provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other than temporarily impaired investments on november   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas which reverts to other than temporary impairment otti guidance that existed prior to the effective date of emerging issues task force eitf issue however  the new fsp retains the disclosure requirements of that have been in effect since the end of fsp fas and requires the application of a three step model to assess and account for investments that may be impaired 
if an investment is found to be impaired its fair value is less than the recorded cost  the extent of the impairment is assessed using the guidance contained in paragraph of sfas no 
 sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  paragraph of accounting principles board opinion and eitf issue if the assessment results in a conclusion that the impairment is other than temporary  an impairment loss equal to the amount that the investment s recorded cost exceeds its fair value is recognized in earnings and the investment s carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
that fair value becomes the investment s new cost basis and any subsequent recoveries of fair value are not recognized 
after recognition of an impairment loss  income recognition is based on the investment s estimated cash flows rather than its contractual cash flows  and any discount or premium would be amortized over the remaining life of the security 
the provisions of this fsp were adopted as of december   as permitted  and had no effects on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement when the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
the statement requires that changes in accounting principles be applied retrospectively unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
in those cases  retrospective application of the new accounting principle is required to be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings or other appropriate equity account at that time 
if application of the new principle is impracticable for all prior periods  then it is to be adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
only the direct effects of the change are to be applied retrospectively  indirect changes are accounted for in the period of the change 
this statement also requires that certain changes in accounting methods be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle with retrospective application applied 
this statement carries forward the guidance of apb opinion with regard to corrections of accounting errors 
restatement of prior period financial statements is required in these cases  with adjustments made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  with an offsetting capital account adjustment  as of the beginning of the first period presented 
this statement was adopted effective january  and had no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements 
recent developments as part of an ongoing planning process  during the first quarter of  the corporation s board of directors concluded that the multi bank holding company concept was not in the best long range interest of its shareholders  customers or employees 
the board directed management to plan for a transition to a single bank charter  to be implemented by year end  contingent on all required legal and regulatory approvals 
the corporation anticipates that  when implemented  the single bank charter model will result in significant financial savings and improved operational effectiveness 
the corporation also anticipates that this change will improve customer services by substantially increasing the number of branch banking locations available to all of the banks customers  by improving the nature and quality of deposit and loan products  and by accelerating the approval process for most conforming loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the corporation s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the corporation manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and this risk could potentially have the largest material effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of community banking activities 
achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the corporation s asset liability function 
the corporation attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the corporation seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
the corporation s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be material over time 
the corporation s asset liability committee uses a simulation model to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the corporation s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated on a quarterly basis in order to obtain the most accurate forecast possible 
the forecast presents information over a twelve month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and variations that occur when rates increase and decrease  and basis points 
according to the model  as of december  the corporation is positioned so that net interest income would increase  and net income would increase  if interest rates were to rise basis points in the next twelve months 
conversely  net interest income would decline  and net income would decline  if interest rates were to decline basis points 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates and loan prepayment  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the corporation could undertake in response to changes in interest rates or the effects of responses by others  including borrowers and depositors

interest bearing liabilities with no contractual maturity  such as savings deposits and interest bearing transaction accounts  are reflected in the earliest repricing period possible 
fixed rate time deposits are reflected at their maturity dates 
the static interest rate sensitivity gap position  while not a complete measure of interest sensitivity  is also reviewed periodically to provide insights related to the static repricing structure of the banks assets and liabilities 
at december  on a cumulative basis through twelve months  rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets by  the liability sensitive position is largely due to the assumption that the banks  in interest bearing transaction accounts  savings accounts  and money market accounts will reprice within a year 
this assumption may or may not be valid  since these accounts vary greatly in their sensitivity to interest rate changes in the market 
rising interest rates would be likely to diminish net interest income of banks in a liability sensitive position if the assumption is valid and in the absence of factors which would be likely to occur 
the market risk table  which follows this discussion  shows the corporation s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments  and prepayment of principal and potential calls 
for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents principal cash flows based on management s judgment concerning their most likely runoff 
the actual maturities and runoff could vary substantially if future prepayments  runoff and calls differ from the corporation s historical experience
