item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we operate ambulatory surgery centers and private surgical hospitals in the united states and the united kingdom 
as of december   we operated facilities  consisting of in the united states and three in the united kingdom 
all of our us facilities are jointly owned with local physicians  and of these facilities are also partially owned by various not for profit healthcare systems 
in addition to facilitating the joint ownership of most of our existing facilities  our agreements with these healthcare systems provide a framework for the planning 
table of contents and construction of additional facilities in the future  including all four facilities we are currently constructing as well as additional projects under development 
our us facilities  consisting of ambulatory surgery centers and private surgical hospitals each are generally referred to herein as short stay surgical facilities  specialize in non emergency surgical cases  the volume of which has steadily increased over the past two decades due in part to advancements in medical technology 
these facilities earn a fee from patients  insurance companies  or other payors in exchange for providing the facility and related services a surgeon requires in order to perform a surgical case 
in addition  we in turn earn a monthly fee from each facility we operate in exchange for managing its operations 
all but three of our facilities are located in the us  where we have focused increasingly on adding facilities with not for profit healthcare system partners hospital partners 
at december   of our us facilities were jointly owned with a hospital partner 
by december   this proportion had grown to 
in the united kingdom we operate private hospitals  which supplement the services provided by the government sponsored healthcare system 
our patients choose to receive care at private hospitals primarily because of waiting lists to receive diagnostic procedures or elective surgery at government sponsored facilities and pay us either from personal funds or through private insurance  which is offered by an increasing number of employers as a benefit to their employees 
since acquiring our first two facilities in the united kingdom in  we have expanded selectively by adding a third facility and increasing the capacity and services offered at each facility 
our continued growth and success depends on our ability to continue to grow volumes at our existing facilities  to successfully open new facilities we develop  to successfully integrate acquired facilities into our operations  and to maintain productive relationships with our hospital partners 
we believe we will have significant opportunities to operate more facilities with hospital partners in the future in existing and new markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements under gaap requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
estimates are based on information available as of the date financial statements are prepared 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and that require management s most subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include our policies and estimates regarding consolidation  revenue recognition and accounts receivable  income taxes  and goodwill and intangible assets 
consolidation we own less than of each facility we operate 
as discussed in results of operations  we operate all of our us facilities through joint ventures with physicians 
increasingly  these joint ventures also include a not for profit healthcare system as a partner 
we generally have a leadership role in these facilities through a significant voting and economic interest and a contract to manage each facility s operations  but the degree of control we have varies from facility to facility 
accordingly  as of december   we consolidated the financial results of of the facilities we operate  including one in which we hold no ownership but control through a long term service agreement  and account for under the equity method 
our determination of the appropriate consolidation method to follow with respect to our investments in subsidiaries and affiliates is based on the amount of control we have  combined with our ownership level  in the underlying entity 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and other investees over which we have control 
investments in companies we do not control  but over whose operations we have the ability to exercise significant influence including investments where have less than ownership  are accounted for under the equity method 

table of contents accounting for an investment as consolidated versus equity method has no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period  but it does impact individual income statement and balance sheet balances 
under either consolidation or equity method accounting  the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss based on its ownership percentage 
at december   all of the company s investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity method 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as updated  which has four criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria 
over of our facilities surgical cases are performed under contracted or government mandated fee schedules or discount arrangements 
the patient service revenues recorded for these cases are recorded at the contractually defined amount at the time of billing 
the predictability of the remaining revenue  for which contractual adjustments are estimated based on historical collections  is such that adjustments to these estimates in subsequent periods have not had a material impact in any period presented 
if the discount percentage used in estimating revenues for the cases not billed pursuant to fee schedules were changed by  our after tax net income would change by less than  the collection cycle for patient services revenue is relatively short  typically ranging from to days depending upon payor and geographic norms  which allows us to evaluate our estimates frequently 
our revenues earned under management and other service contracts are typically based upon objective formulas driven by an entity s financial performance and are generally earned and paid monthly 
our accounts receivable are comprised of receivables from both the united kingdom and the united states 
as of december   approximately of our total accounts receivable were attributable to our uk business 
because our uk facilities only treat patients who have a demonstrated ability to pay  our uk patients arrange for payment prior to treatment and our bad debt expense in the uk is very low 
in it was only  which is of our total uk revenues of million 
in addition  our average days sales out standing in the uk was as of december  our us accounts receivable were approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  in  uninsured or self pay revenues only accounted for of our us revenue and of our accounts receivable balance was comprised of amounts owed from patients  including the patient portion of amounts covered by insurance 
insurance revenues including government payors accounted for of our us revenue and of our accounts receivable balance was comprised of amounts owed from contracted payors 
our us facilities primarily perform routine elective surgery that is scheduled in advance by physicians who have already seen the patient 
as part of our internal control processes  we verify benefits  obtain insurance authorization  calculate patient financial responsibility and notify the patient of their responsibility  all prior to surgery 
the nature of our business is such that we do not have any significant receivables that are pending approval from third party payors 
we also focus our collection efforts on aged accounts receivable 
however  due to complexities involved in insurance reimbursements and inherent limitations in verification procedures  our business will always have some level of bad debt expense 
in both and  our bad debt expense attributable to us revenue was 
in addition  as of december   our average days sales outstanding in the us was  and the aging of our us accounts receivable was less than days old  between and days and over days old 
our us bad debt allowance at december  represented of our us accounts receivable balance 
due to the nature of our business  management relies upon the aging of accounts receivable as its primary tool to estimate bad debt expense 
therefore  we reserve for bad debt based solely upon the aging of accounts receivable  without differentiating by payor source 
we write off accounts on an individual basis based on that aging 
we believe our reserve policy allows us to accurately estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
if  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
goodwill and intangible assets given the significance of our intangible assets as a percentage of our total assets  we also consider our accounting policy regarding goodwill and intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy 
consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles but rather test them for impairment annually or more often when circumstances change in a manner that indicates they may be impaired 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and tested for impairment when circumstances change in a manner that indicates their carrying values may not be recoverable 
impairment tests occur at the reporting unit level for goodwill  our reporting units are defined as our operating segments countries  and we have never recorded a goodwill impairment charge 
our intangible assets consist primarily of rights to manage individual surgical facilities and predominantly have indefinite lives 
the values of these rights are tested individually  and no impairment charges have been recorded with respect to these assets 
discontinued operations effective september   we sold our spanish operations  receiving proceeds of million  net of a million tax payment made in the fourth quarter of collection of a portion of the sales proceeds was deferred until january  at which time we expect to collect an additional million in cash 
in  we recorded an after tax gain of million on the sale  which is reflected in discontinued operations 
during we finalized the calculation of the tax liability arising from our sale of the spanish operations  and provided for additional legal costs associated with the sale  which resulted in a million increase to the net gain on the sale 
the results of our spanish operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
acquisitions  equity investments and development projects during  eight surgery centers and one surgical hospital developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
effective january   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in westwood  california in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  for million in cash 
effective may   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in san antonio  texas  for million in cash 
we also engage in investing transactions that are not business combinations 
these transactions primarily consist of acquisitions and sales of noncontrolling equity interests in surgical facilities and the investment of additional cash in surgical facilities under development 
during the year ended december   these transactions resulted in a net cash outflow of million  of which million was paid to acquire additional ownership in nine facilities we operate in the dallas fort worth market  net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of three other facilities in this same market  million was paid for equity method investments in two surgery centers near kansas city  missouri  million was paid for an equity method investment in a surgery center in the sacramento  california area  million was paid to acquire additional ownership in a facility the we operate in new jersey  and million was received from three not for profit healthcare systems for noncontrolling interests in six facilities we already operated 
included in these transactions are call options allowing the healthcare systems to acquire additional noncontrolling ownership interests in each facility in with respect to four of the facilities  the approximate sales price is million and we have a put option with the same terms 
with 
table of contents respect to the other two facilities  the systems have call options that  for one facility  fix the price at million and in the other case base the price on a multiple of earnings when the option is exercised 
we have no put options with respect to these two facilities  and million of other net purchases of equity interests 
we also paid a total of million to various sellers related to the resolution of contingencies that had existed at the time we made certain acquisitions 
in addition  in december we made an advance payment of million to the sellers of an ambulatory surgery center in st 
louis  missouri 
this transaction was effective january  during  six surgery centers and two surgical hospitals developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
effective december  we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in san antonio  texas  for approximately million in cash 
effective november   we acquired specialty surgicenters  inc  which operates four surgical centers  and concurrently acquired a portion of the minority ownership interests in one of these facilities for aggregate consideration of approximately million in cash 
we subsequently acquired a portion of the minority ownership interest in another one of these facilities for approximately million 
effective october   we acquired same day surgery  llc  which owns five multi specialty surgery centers in metropolitan chicago  and concurrently acquired a portion of the minority ownership interests in four of these facilities for approximately million in cash 
effective august   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in dallas  texas in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  for million in cash 
effective july   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in reading  pennsylvania  for approximately million in cash 
effective may   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in austintown  ohio  in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest  for million in cash 
effective january   we acquired a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in torrance  california in which we had previously owned a noncontrolling interest 
the million cost was paid in cash in december during the year ended december   investing transactions that were not business combinations resulted in net cash outflows totaling million  of which million was paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgical hospital and an ambulatory surgery center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  million to acquire additional ownership in a surgery center in westwood  california  and million to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgery center near baltimore  maryland 
during  three surgery centers and one surgical hospital developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
during june  we acquired a interest in an ambulatory surgery center in austin  texas for million in cash 
during april  we acquired a private surgical hospital in london  england for approximately million million  in cash 
sources of revenue revenues primarily include net patient service revenue for the facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes  which are those in which we have ownership interests of greater than or otherwise maintain effective control  management and administrative services revenue  consisting of the fees that we earn from managing the facilities that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes and the fees we earn from providing certain consulting and administrative services to physicians 
our consolidated revenues and expenses do not 
table of contents include the management fees we earn from operating the facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes as those fees are charged to subsidiaries and thus eliminate in consolidation 
the following table summarizes our revenues by type and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  net patient service revenue management and administrative services revenue total revenue net patient service revenue consists of the revenues earned by facilities we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
these revenues increased as a percentage of our total revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the corresponding prior year period  primarily as a result of our acquisition of seven consolidating facilities during the fourth quarter of while we did not increase our consolidated facility count in  these seven facilities now have a full year of activity reflected in our results 
this percentage increased for the twelve month period december  as compared to the prior twelve month period  due to increasing the number of facilities we consolidate for financial reporting purposes by eleven from december  to december  while we also added eleven unconsolidated facilities during this time period  the revenues we derive from unconsolidated facilities are limited to fees we earn for managing their operations  and thus adding an unconsolidated facility generally increases our revenues by far less than adding a consolidated facility 
our management and administrative services revenues are earned from the following types of activities years ended december  management of surgical facilities consulting and other services provided to physicians and related entities total management and administrative service revenues the following table summarizes our revenues by operating segment years ended december  united states united kingdom total revenues earned in the united states increased as a percentage of our overall revenues in due to the growth of consolidated revenue in the us as discussed above 
in  revenues earned in the united kingdom increased as a percentage of our overall revenues  primarily due to the weakening us dollar 
the dollar weakened against the british pound by during 
table of contents equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates the following table reflects the summarized results of the unconsolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method of accounting dollars in thousands years ended december  revenues equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates operating expenses salaries  benefits  and other employee costs medical services and supplies other operating expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other income before income taxes long term debt uspi s equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates uspi s implied weighted average ownership percentage based on affiliates pre tax income uspi s implied weighted average ownership percentage based on affiliates debt unconsolidated facilities operated at period end our weighted average percentage ownership in our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated as uspi s equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates divided by the total net income of unconsolidated affiliates for each respective period 
this percentage is higher in due primarily to our acquisition of additional ownership in facilities we account for under the equity method 
for the twelve months ended december   this percentage is lower as compared to the previous twelve months primarily as a result of losses incurred at facilities that were recently opened or under development 
our weighted average percentage ownership in our unconsolidated affiliates is calculated as the total debt of each unconsolidated affiliate  multiplied by the percentage ownership uspi held in the affiliate as of the end of each respective period  divided by the total debt of all of the unconsolidated affiliates as of the end of each respective period 
this percentage is higher in due primarily to our acquisition of additional ownership in facilities we account for under the equity method 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes certain statements of income items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization operating income minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries interest and other expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations net income executive summary we continue to grow our existing facilities  develop new facilities  and add others selectively through acquisition 
on an overall basis  we continue to experience increases in the volume of services provided and in the average rates at which our facilities are reimbursed for those services  resulting in revenue growth at the facilities we owned during both applicable periods in and same store facilities 
during late and  we deployed all of the proceeds from our september sale of our discontinued spanish operations 
the facilities we acquired  all of which are in the united states  also contributed greatly to our revenues and earnings in an increasing proportion of our facilities are accounted for under the equity method 
generally  this results from our strategy of partnering with not for profit hospitals and local physicians  which we believe improves the long term profitability and potential of our facilities 
all of our us facilities are co owned with physicians  and more than two thirds of our us facilities also include a not for profit hospital partner 
during the twelve month period ended december  we added facilities and sold our interest in one facility 
the number of facilities we co own with a hospital partner increased by  as of the newly added facilities included a hospital partner and we added a hospital partner in to seven facilities we had acquired during we account for of these facilities under the equity method 
because so much of our business is conducted through unconsolidated investees  our discussion and analysis of results of operations includes same store facility growth rates  ignoring how much we own of each facility  to help explain the underlying businesses that are driving our consolidated results 
additionally  we provide aggregated condensed financial statements for our unconsolidated affiliates 
in  these indicators demonstrate that  while consolidated revenues increased over  our core growth rates were slower than in recent years due to our increasing size and several factors affecting the volume of services we provided and the rates at which we were reimbursed 
while same store growth was slower than in prior years  it was within the range we predicted for  as were our overall earnings from continuing operations  which grew in revenues our consolidated revenues have increased compared to the prior year mostly as a result of newly developed or acquired us facilities  driven in part by our reinvesting the cash proceeds of our september sale of the spanish operations in us facilities 
however  we believe that our continued growth and success depends heavily on the performance of facilities we already operate  including those accounted for under the equity method as well as facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
our revenue from same store facilities has 
table of contents continued to increase in  driven by increases in the volume of surgical cases in the us and of patient admissions for our hospitals in the united kingdom  as well as an increase in the average rate of reimbursement for the surgeries performed at our us facilities  most notably at three large facilities we opened during the second quarter of the rate of same store revenue growth was slower than in prior years  but within the range that management expected at the beginning of the most significant factor reducing same store revenue growth from the rate experienced in is the composition of the same store group of facilities 
while we constructed new facilities largely as planned facilities during  we operate more facilities each year  which means that the higher growth second and third year facilities comprise a smaller percentage of our overall facility count 
acquiring existing facilities  as we did  for example  in the fourth quarter of facilities and the first half of facilities  also contributes to the lowering of our same store revenue growth because we add these relatively established facilities including their prior year performance to our same store statistics 
other factors contributing to slower growth in were the continuing effect of a lapsed managed care contract in a major market  reductions in workers compensation reimbursement rates in texas  california  and tennessee  and generally slower case volume growth  which we believe is driven by increasing levels of competition in many markets in which we operate 
with the exception of the tennessee rate reductions  which went into effect july   the other rate of reimbursement factors described above had reached their one year anniversary by december  and thus would not be expected to adversely impact same store revenue growth rates 
in addition  the lapsed managed care contract was addressed in the fourth quarter of through the establishment of a new contract with this payor 
the following table summarizes the revenue growth at our same store facilities years ended december  united states facilities net revenue surgical cases net revenue per case united kingdom facilities net revenue using actual exchange rates net revenue using constant exchange rates all same store facilities net revenue using actual exchange rates our overall domestic same store growth in net revenue per case was favorably impacted by the growth at our nine same store surgical hospitals  which on average perform more complex cases than ambulatory surgery centers 
for the year ended  the net revenue per case of our same store ambulatory surgery centers excluding surgical hospitals increased compared to the corresponding prior year period 
this rate of growth was slower than in prior years largely as a result of the workers compensation reimbursement changes and lapse of the managed care contract described above 
measures current year using prior year exchange rates 

table of contents joint ventures with not for profit hospitals the addition of new facilities continues to be more heavily weighted to us surgical facilities with a hospital partner  both as we initiate joint venture agreements with new systems and as we add facilities to our existing arrangements 
facilities have been added to hospital joint ventures both through construction of new facilities de novos and through our contribution of our equity interests in existing facilities into a hospital joint venture structure  effectively creating three way joint ventures by sharing our ownership in these facilities with a hospital partner while leaving the existing physician ownership intact 
all four of the facilities we are currently constructing involve a hospital partner  as do all nine of the other projects currently in the earlier stages of development 
the following table summarizes our facilities as of december    and united states facilities with a hospital partner without a hospital partner total us facilities united kingdom facilities total facilities operated change from prior year end de novo newly constructed acquisition disposals total increase in number of facilities at december   physicians own a portion of all of these facilities 
we acquired facilities without a hospital partner in seven of these had a hospital partner by december  as a result of our selling a portion of the equity interests we had acquired in we sold our ownership interest in a facility in cottonwood  arizona during the first quarter of facility operating margins us same store operating margins received downward pressure during the twelve months ended as compared to the prior twelve month period  due primarily to the revenue factors discussed above  which caused revenue growth to slow and to no longer outpace our facilities growth in operating expenses 
while the issue of the lapsed managed care contract was resolved during the fourth quarter of  it negatively affected year over year comparisons for most of many of our same store facilities were adversely impacted by the workers compensation rate reductions in texas and tennessee 
all of the facilities affected by the lapsed contract are co owned with a not for profit hospital partner  as are most facilities being adversely impacted by the workers compensation rate reductions 
in addition to these factors  the average operating margin of our same store facilities with a hospital partner is being adversely impacted by the higher number of facilities we opened with hospital partners in as compared to earlier periods 
as these facilities are added to the same store group in  they reduce the average margin of the with a hospital partner group 
this occurs because these facilities  while earning higher margins in than during  are not yet earning margins as high as our more mature facilities 
this effect is particularly significant for three large facilities we opened during the second quarter of  which were added to the same store group in in our experience larger facilities take longer to earn a positive margin  the impact of which can be significant given that they also earn higher revenues than a smaller facility 
our uk facilities  which comprise of our facilities overall  experienced a decrease in the overall facility margins as a result of an unfavorable payer mix affecting one facility and a drop in referrals from the national health service 

table of contents the following table summarizes our same store operating margins see footnote below year ended december  united states facilities with a hospital partner bps bps bps without a hospital partner total us facilities united kingdom facilities bps bps bps operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by total revenues 
this table aggregates all of the same store facilities we operate using of their results 
this does not represent the overall margin for uspi s operations in either the us or us because we have a variety of ownership levels in the facilities we operate  and facilities open for less than a year are excluded from same store calculations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase consisted primarily of revenues of newly constructed or acquired facilities and additionally growth of our same store facilities 
the net addition of consolidating facilities from december  to december  caused an increase of approximately million of revenues  while revenues from same store facilities drove most of the remaining million of revenue growth 
the us same store facilities performed approximately more surgical cases and received an average of approximately more per case during the year ended december  than in the corresponding prior year period 
the revenues of same store united kingdom facilities  when measured using exchange rates for both periods  were million higher during the year ended december  than in the corresponding prior year period 
the us dollar being stronger relative to the british pound in than in the corresponding prior year period resulted in a million decrease in uk revenues 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributed to our increased focus on joint ventures with hospital partners  the ramp up of facilities opened in  and increased ownership in nine facilities we operate in the dallas fort worth market 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the year ended  from for the year ended this decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily attributable to the growth in facilities opened in and our leveraging corporate overhead over a larger number of facilities 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount increased due primarily as a result of depreciation of assets added through acquisitions and newly opened facilities 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 
operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year  primarily as a result of our leveraging corporate overhead and the growth in margins at facilities opened in interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of additional interest income earned on our increased cash balance  which resulted from the sale of our spanish operations during  more than offsetting our subsidiaries borrowing a portion of the costs of developing and expanding facilities 

table of contents other expense  net of other income decreased million  or  to million of other income for the year ended december  from million of expense for the year ended december   primarily due to the loss of million related to the early termination of a credit facility 
minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our adding seven consolidating facilities in the fourth quarter of and additionally due to the increased profitability of our existing facilities 
provision for income taxes was million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  net income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of  or million  results primarily from the increases in revenues  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
effective september  we sold our spanish operations 
as a result  our income statement reflects the historical results of our spanish operations in discontinued operations for both years 
during we finalized the calculation of the tax liability arising from our sale of the spanish operations  and provided for additional legal costs associated with the sale  which resulted in a million increase to the net gain on the sale 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by growth of our us same store facilities  which performed more surgical cases and received an average of approximately more per case in than in this us growth rate was slower than in the prior year largely as a result of decreases in rates of reimbursement for workers compensation cases in california and texas and due to the lapse of a managed care contract in one market 
our same store uk facilities revenue excluding exchange rate fluctuations increased in as activity increased at the hospital and cancer center we added during additionally  revenues increased by million in due to our acquiring facilities or significantly increasing our ownership level in facilities we already operated  and by million due to the us dollar being weaker against the british pound in than in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of growth in case volumes and improved operating margins at our same store facilities 
operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased as a percentage of revenues from to primarily as a result of our same facility margin improvement and leveraging of corporate overhead being more than offset by the unfavorable impact of two surgical hospitals we opened during the second quarter of  which are not yet operating at capacity 
our new and newly expanded facilities  particularly the surgical hospitals  hire staff and become fully equipped for a relative high number of surgical cases in their initial months of operations  but the case volumes are not high enough initially to result in operating margins that are as favorable as those generated by our more mature facilities 
in addition  we experienced revenue reductions due to reimbursement factors discussed above and due to the relocation of two facilities that were not accompanied by proportional decreases in operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount increased due primarily as a result of depreciation of assets added through acquisitions and newly opened facilities 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 

table of contents operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year  primarily as a result of our improved same facility operating margins and leveraging of corporate overhead being more than offset by the lower margins generated at our recently opened facilities and the slower growth of revenues discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our borrowing a portion of the costs of developing and expanding facilities 
other expense  net of other income increased million  or  to million of other expense for the year ended december  from million of other income for the year ended december   primarily due to the million loss on early termination of credit facility  which management elected to terminate upon receiving net cash proceeds of million from the sale of the spanish operations 
minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our adding a net total of consolidated facilities during and additionally due to the increased profitability of our existing facilities 
provision for income taxes was million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the lower tax rate in resulted from revisions in estimates of various federal and state tax deductions made in connection with the preparation of our tax returns for net income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase of  or million  results primarily from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
effective september  we sold our spanish operations 
as a result  our income statement reflects the historical results of our spanish operations in discontinued operations for both years 
in addition  our income statement reflects  in discontinued operations  the million gain on the sale of the spanish operations 
including the gain on the sale of our spanish operations  our net income increased from million in to million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated million of cash flows from operating activities as compared to million during and million during included in the million from is a benefit of million  which is not expected to recur  resulting from the collection of receivables in connection with our modifying contracts under which we provide certain administrative services to physicians  eliminating the financing of accounts receivable from the scope of services we provide 
as discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we have reclassified the consolidated impact of cash distributions of our facilities earnings from financing activities to operating activities 
we believe that this treatment best represents the character of these cash flow amounts by netting them with the related accruals of equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries  which enter into the determination of our net income 
we believe recent interpretations provided by the sec with respect to our industry support our classification of these cash flows within operating activities 
a significant element of our cash flows from operating activities is the collection of accounts receivable 
collections efforts for accounts receivable are conducted primarily by our personnel at each facility or in centralized service centers for some metropolitan areas with multiple facilities 
these collection efforts are facilitated by our patient accounting system  which prompts individual account follow up through a series of phone calls and or collection letters written days after a procedure is billed and at day intervals thereafter 
bad debt reserves are established in increasing percentages by aging category based on historical collection experience 
generally  the entire amount of all accounts remaining uncollected days after the date of service are written off as bad debt and sent to an outside collection agency 
net amounts received from collection agencies are recorded as recoveries of bad debts 

table of contents during the year ended december   our net cash required for investing activities was million  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of businesses and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
the million primarily represents purchases of new businesses  net of cash received  and incremental investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the most significant of these transactions were million was paid to acquire additional ownership in nine facilities the company operates in the dallas fort worth market  net of proceeds from the sale of a portion of three other facilities in this same market  million was paid to acquire a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in san antonio  texas  million was paid to acquire a controlling interest in an ambulatory surgery center in westwood  california in which we previously owned a noncontrolling interest  million was paid to acquire additional ownership in a facility the company operates in new jersey  million was paid for equity method investments in two surgery centers near kansas city  missouri  million was paid for an equity method investment in a surgery center in the sacramento  california area  million was received from three not for profit healthcare systems for noncontrolling interests in facilities already operated by the company 
included in these transactions are call options allowing the healthcare systems to acquire additional noncontrolling ownership interests in each facility in with respect to four of the facilities  the approximate sales price is million and the company has a put option with the same terms 
with respect to the other two facilities  the systems have call options that  for one facility  fix the price at million and in the other case base the price on a multiple of earnings when the option is exercised 
the company has no put options with respect to these two facilities  and million of other transactions 
approximately million of the property and equipment purchases related to ongoing development projects  and the remaining million primarily represents purchases of equipment at existing facilities 
investing cash flows also include an advance payment of million that was paid to the sellers of an ambulatory surgery center in st 
louis  missouri for a transaction that was effective january  the million of cash used in investing activities was funded primarily with the proceeds of the sale of our spanish operations and the cash flows from operations noted above 
net cash provided during the year ended december  by financing activities totaled million and resulted primarily from our sweeping the cash of our unconsolidated affiliates together with cash proceeds from issuances of stock under our employee stock purchase plan and from exercises of employee stock options 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  and net working capital was million at december  as compared to million in the prior year 
on february   we entered into a revolving credit facility with a group of commercial lenders providing us with the ability to borrow up to million for acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the united states 
under the terms of the facility  we may invest up to a total of million in subsidiaries that are not guarantors  including subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
borrowings under our credit facility will bear interest at rates of to over libor and will mature on february  currently  no amounts are outstanding under this facility  although we anticipate borrowing up to million in april to fund the surgis acquisition 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants  including covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to borrow money or guarantee other indebtedness  grant liens on our assets  make investments  use assets as security in other transactions  pay dividends on stock  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or sell assets or capital stock 
our credit agreement in the united kingdom provides for total borrowings of million approximately million as of december  under four separate facilities 
at december   total outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement were approximately million which represents total borrowings net of scheduled repayments of million that have been made under the agreement  and approximately million was available for borrowing  primarily for capital projects specified in the agreement 
borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility bear interest at rates of to over libor and mature in april we pledged 
table of contents the capital stock of our uk subsidiaries to secure borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreements as of december  in december  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of million after offering costs of million and a discount of million 
the notes  which mature on december   accrue interest at payable semi annually on june and december commencing on june  and were issued at a discount of million  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
the senior subordinated notes are subordinate to all senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by uspi and uspi s wholly owned subsidiaries domiciled in the united states 
the company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after december  upon not less than nor more than days notice 
the redemption price would be the following percentages of principal amount  if redeemed during the month period commencing on december of the years set forth below period redemption price the company may also redeem the notes at any time prior to december   by paying the principal amount of all outstanding notes plus the greater of a of the principal amount or b the excess of the present value of the notes and all interest that would accrue through december  over the principal amount of the notes 
the company is obligated to offer to purchase the notes at of the principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events 
in addition  the company was obligated to apply the proceeds of the sales of the spanish operations within one year to the company s operations or to repurchase the notes 
the company was successful in applying all million of the proceeds to the acquisition and development of surgical facilities in the united states within this time period  and is therefore not obligated to repurchase the notes 
any redemptions of the notes require payment of all amounts of accrued but unpaid interest 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to our senior subordinated notes as of december  our contractual cash obligations as of december  may be summarized as follows payments due by period contractual cash obligations total within year years and years and beyond years in thousands long term debt obligations principal plus interest senior subordinated notes uk credit facility other debt at operating subsidiaries capitalized lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations amounts shown for long term debt obligations and capital lease obligations include the associated interest 
for variable rate debt  the interest is calculated using the december  rates applicable to each debt instrument 

table of contents our operating subsidiaries  many of which have minority interest holders who share in the cash flow of these entities  have debt consisting primarily of capitalized lease obligations 
this debt is generally non recourse to uspi  the parent company  and is generally secured by the assets of those operating entities 
the total amount of these obligations  which was million at december   is included in our consolidated balance sheet because the borrower or obligated entity meets the requirements for consolidated financial reporting 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual subsidiary s amount of debt and capitalized leased obligations  of these consolidated subsidiaries was at december  additionally  our unconsolidated affiliates that we account for under the equity method have debt and capitalized lease obligations that are generally non recourse to uspi and are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
currently  uspi and its affiliates have four surgery centers under construction and nine additional surgery centers in the development stage in the united states 
costs to develop a short stay surgical facility  which include construction  equipment and initial operating losses  vary depending on the range of specialties that will be undertaken at the facility 
our affiliates have budgeted an average of million for development costs for each of the four surgery center projects 
development costs are typically funded with approximately debt at the entity level with the remainder provided as equity from the owners of the entity 
we have made substantially all of the equity contributions to which we are obligated for three of these projects under construction and are obligated to invest an additional million for the other project under construction  but we may choose to invest additional funds in these or other projects in additionally  as each of these facilities becomes operational  each will have obligations associated with debt and capital lease arrangements 
generally  we estimate that we will add to facilities per year  with the majority being new facilities developed by us 
this program will continue to require substantial capital resources  which for this number of facilities we would estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
if we identify strategic acquisition opportunities that are larger than usual for us  then these costs could increase greatly 
for example  during january we acquired interests in five surgery centers in the st 
louis market for approximately million  of which million was paid in december  and entered into an agreement to acquire surgis  which operates facilities and has an additional under development  for approximately million 
we expect to acquire an additional facilities in greater st 
louis later in while our acquisition of these four facilities  and the surgis facilities  may not be successfully completed  they represent potential additional uses of our capital that we would have to fund 
other than the specific transactions described above  our acquisition and development activities primarily include the development of new facilities  buyups of additional ownership in facilities we already operate  and acquisitions of additional facilities 
these activities also include  in some cases  payments of additional purchase price to the sellers of acquired facilities based upon the resolution of certain contingencies or based upon acquired facilities achieving certain financial targets 
we currently estimate that we will pay approximately million related to these obligations which is payable during  is based on contingencies that have been resolved  and accordingly has been accrued as an increase to intangible assets and other accrued expenses in our december  balance sheet 
it is also possible we may have to pay the buyers of our spanish operations up to approximately million million plus interest related to a spanish tax contingency for which we indemnified the buyers  although we do not presently believe the likelihood of our making any such payment is probable  as discussed more fully in the notes to our financial statements 
in addition  the operations of our existing surgical facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
absent transactions that cause us to exceed our generally expected capital uses  such as the st 
louis and surgis acquisitions  we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  and borrowings under capital lease arrangements at newly developed or acquired facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months 
thereafter  such as to complete the pending surgis and st 
louis transactions  we may require additional debt or equity financing for our acquisitions and development projects 
there are no assurances that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we will be required to curtail our acquisition and development program 
off balance sheet arrangements as a result of our strategy of partnering with physicians and not for profit health systems  we do not own controlling interests in most of our facilities 
we account for of our surgical facilities under the equity method 

table of contents similar to our consolidated facilities  our unconsolidated facilities have debts  including capitalized lease obligations  that are generally non recourse to uspi 
with respect to our unconsolidated facilities  these debts are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the total debt on the balance sheets of our unconsolidated affiliates was approximately million 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual affiliate s amount of debt  of these unconsolidated affiliates was at december  uspi or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries had collectively guaranteed million of the million in total debt of our unconsolidated affiliates as of december  in addition  our unconsolidated affiliates have obligations under operating leases  of which uspi or a wholly owned subsidiary had guaranteed million as of december  some of the facilities we are currently developing will be accounted for under the equity method 
as these facilities become operational  they will have debt and lease obligations 
as described above  our unconsolidated affiliates own operational surgical facilities or surgical facilities that are under development 
these entities are structured as limited partnerships  limited liability partnerships  or limited liability companies 
none of these affiliates provide financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support for us 
they also do not engage in hedging  research and development services with us 
moreover  we do not believe that they expose us to any of their liabilities that are not otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
except as noted above with respect to guarantees  we are not obligated to fund losses or otherwise provide additional funding to these affiliates other than as we determine to be economically required in order to successfully implement our development plans 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 which has been the basis of our accounting through december   and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for our first quarter beginning january  and apply to all awards granted  modified or cancelled after that date 
the standard also provides for different transition methods for past award grants 
we plan to use the modified retrospective method  which involves the restatement of prior period results 
sfas no 
r will adversely impact our consolidated net income in  and the amount is expected to be significant 
on an overall basis  our equity based compensation is expected to increase somewhat in as our company continues to grow 
however  much of this expense relates to awards for which the accounting is not significantly changed under sfas no 
r  namely restricted stock awards 
in recent years we have shifted from granting primarily stock options  the expense of which has merely been disclosed  to granting primarily restricted stock awards  the expense of which has been reflected in our income statement even prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
consequently  our pro forma stock option expense has been decreasing in recent quarters as the estimated service periods are completed for outstanding options and their value thus becomes fully amortized 
by the time we adopt sfas no 
r in  we expect that the incremental expense related to the adoption of the standard will therefore be less than our recent pro forma expense disclosures related to stock options  as more stock options vest and become fully amortized 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event 
the effect of our adopting fin for the year ended december  was determined to be immaterial 
in june  the fasb ratified the conclusions of emerging issues task force no 
eitf  determining whether a general partner or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or 
table of contents similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf no 
provides a framework for determining whether a general partner controls  and should consolidate  a limited partnership or similar entity 
eitf no 
is effective for all limited partnerships formed after june  and for any limited partnerships in existence on june  that modify their partnership agreements after that date  and our adoption of eitf with respect to these entities did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
eitf no 
is effective for all limited partnerships beginning january   and we do not expect this phase of adopting eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
historically  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments other than the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps for portions of our borrowings under credit facilities with commercial lenders as required by the credit agreements 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
our financing arrangements with commercial lenders are based on the spread over prime  libor or euribor 
at december   million of our total outstanding notes payable was the senior subordinated notes  which were issued in december at a discount and bear interest at a fixed rate of  million was in other fixed rate instruments and the remaining million was in variable rate instruments 
accordingly  a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual expense of million 
the senior subordinated notes  which represent of our total fixed rate debt at december   are considered to have a fair value  based upon recent trading  of million  which is approximately million higher than the carrying value at december  our united kingdom revenues are a significant portion of our total revenues 
we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  including foreign currency exchange risk and taxes and regulatory changes 
our united kingdom operations operate in a natural hedge to a large extent because both expenses and revenues are denominated in local currency 
additionally  our borrowings and capital lease obligations in the united kingdom are currently denominated in local currency 
historically  the cash generated from our operations in the united kingdom has been utilized within that country to finance development and acquisition activity as well as for repayment of debt denominated in local currency 
accordingly  we have not generally utilized financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
in september  we sold our spanish operations 
by agreement with the buyer  we will not receive approximately million related to the sale until january in september  we entered into a forward contract with a currency broker to lock in the receipt of million in january  when we receive the euro denominated payment of million 
inflation and changing prices have not significantly affected our operating results or the markets in which we perform services
