general overview we are a leading facilities based provider of low cost  high speed internet access and ip communications services 
our network is specifically designed and optimized to transmit data using ip 
ip networks are significantly less expensive to operate and are able to achieve higher performance levels than the traditional circuit switched networks used by our competitors  thus giving us cost and performance advantages in our industry 
we deliver our services to small and medium sized businesses  communications service providers and other bandwidth intensive organizations through approximately  customer connections in north america and western europe 
our primary on net service is internet access at a speed of megabits per second  much faster than typical internet access currently offered to businesses 
we offer this on net service exclusively through our own facilities  which run all the way to our customers premises 
our network is comprised of in building riser facilities  metropolitan optical fiber networks  metropolitan traffic aggregation points and inter city transport facilities 
the network is physically connected entirely through our facilities to  buildings in which we provide our on net services  including over multi tenant office buildings 
we also provide on net services in carrier neutral co location facilities  data centers and single tenant office buildings 
because of our integrated network architecture  we are not dependent on local telephone companies to serve our on net customers 
we emphasize the sale of on net services because we believe we have a competitive advantage in providing these services and our sales of these services generate higher gross profit margins 
we also provide internet connectivity to customers that are not located in buildings directly connected to our network 
we serve these off net customers using other carriers facilities to provide the last mile portion of the link from our customers premises to our network 
we also provide certain non core services which are legacy services which we acquired and continue to support but do not actively sell 
we believe our key opportunity is provided by our high capacity network  which provides us with the ability to add a significant number of customers to our network with minimal incremental costs 
our focus is to add customers to our network in a way that maximizes its use and at the same time provides us with a customer mix that produces strong profit margins 
we are responding to this opportunity by increasing our sales and marketing efforts including increasing our number of sales representatives 
in addition  we may add customers to our network through strategic acquisitions 
we plan to expand our network to locations that can be economically integrated and represent significant concentrations of internet traffic 
we may identify locations that we desire to serve with our on net product but cannot be cost effectively added to our network 
one of our keys to developing a profitable business will be to carefully match the expense of extending our network to reach new customers with the revenue generated by those customers 
we believe the two most important trends in our industry are the continued growth in internet traffic and a decline in internet access prices 
as internet traffic continues to grow and prices per unit of traffic continue to decline  we believe our ability to load our network and gain market share from less efficient network operators will expand 
however  continued erosion in internet access prices will likely have a negative impact on the rate at which we can increase our revenues and our profit margins 
we have grown our net service revenue from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we have generated our revenue growth through the strategic acquisitions of communications network assets and customers  primarily from financially distressed companies  the continued expansion of our network of on net buildings and the increase in customers generated by our sales and marketing efforts 
our on net service consists of high speed internet access and ip connectivity ranging from megabits per second to several gigabits per second of bandwidth 
we offer our on net services to customers located in buildings that are physically connected to our network 
off net services are sold to businesses that are connected to our network primarily by means of t  t  e and e lines obtained from other carriers 
our non core services  which consist of legacy services of companies whose assets or businesses we have acquired  include managed modem services  email  retail dial up internet access  shared web hosting  managed web hosting  managed security  voice services only provided in toronto  canada  point to point private line services  and services that were provided to lambdanet germany under a network sharing arrangement as discussed below 
we do not actively market these non core services and expect the net service revenue associated with them to continue to decline 
our on net  off net and non core services comprised  and of our net service revenue  respectively  for the year ended december  and  and for the year ended december  while we target our sales and marketing efforts at increasing on net customers  customers we add through acquisitions will also affect the mix of on net and off net revenues 
for example  off net service revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue in as compared to due to the inclusion of a full year of revenue from customers we added through our december acquisition of the off net internet access customers of verio  inc we expect the percentage of on net revenues to increase as a percentage of total revenues in we have grown our gross profit from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our gross profit margin has expanded from in to for the year ended december  we determine gross profit by subtracting network operation expenses excluding amortization of deferred compensation from our net service revenue 
the amortization of deferred compensation classified as cost of network services was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe that our gross profit will benefit and continue to expand as we are allocating the majority of our sales resources toward obtaining additional on net customers and as sales of these services generate higher gross profit margins than our off net and non core services 
we believe that as we add on net customers we incur limited incremental expenses 
we have not allocated depreciation and amortization expense to our network operations expense 
due to our strategic acquisitions of network assets and equipment  we believe we are positioned to grow our revenue base and profitability without significant additional capital investments 
we continue to deploy network equipment to other parts of our network to maximize the utilization of our assets 
as a result  our future capital expenditures will be based primarily on our planned expansion of on net buildings and the concentration and growth of our customer base 
we expect our future capital expenditure rate to be similar to the rate we experienced for we plan to increase our number of on net buildings to approximately  by december  from  at december  historically  our operating expenses have exceeded our net service revenue resulting in operating losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in each of these periods  our operating expenses consisted primarily of the following network operations expenses which consist primarily of the cost of leased circuits  sites and facilities  telecommunications license agreements  network maintenance expenses  and salaries of  and expenses related to  employees who are directly involved with maintenance and operation of our network 
selling general and administrative expenses which consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related benefits paid to our employees and related selling and administrative costs including professional fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses which result from the depreciation of our property and equipment  including the assets associated with our network and the amortization of our intangible assets 
amortization of deferred compensation that results from the expense related to certain stock options and our restricted stock granted to our employees 
restructuring charges that resulted from the termination of our paris office lease 
acquisitions since our inception  we have consummated acquisitions through which we have generated revenue growth  expanded our network and customer base and added strategic assets to our business 
we have accomplished this primarily by acquiring financially distressed companies or their assets at a significant discount to their original cost 
the overall impact of these acquisitions on the operation of our business has been to extend the physical reach of our network in both north america and western europe  expand the breadth of our service offerings  and increase the number of customers to whom we provide our services 
the overall impact of these acquisitions on our balance sheet and cash flows has been to significantly increase the assets on our balance sheet  including cash in the case of the allied riser merger  increase our indebtedness and increase our cash flows from operations due to our increased customer base 
a substantial portion of our historical growth in net service revenue and specifically off net and non core revenues has been generated by the customer contracts we have acquired 
following an acquisition  we have historically experienced a decline in revenue attributable to acquired customers as these customers contracts have expired and they have entered into standard cogent customer contracts at generally lower rates or have chosen not to renew service with us 
we anticipate that we will experience similar declines with respect to customers we have acquired or will acquire 
acquisition of verio in december  we acquired most of the off net internet access customers of verio inc  a leading global ip provider and subsidiary of ntt communications corp 
the acquired assets included over  primarily off net customer connections located in of our us markets  customer accounts receivable and certain network equipment 
we also assumed the liabilities associated with providing services to these customers including vendor relationships  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
acquisition of aleron in october  we acquired certain assets of aleron broadband services  formally known as agis internet  and million in cash  in exchange for  shares of our series m preferred stock  which converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in february we acquired aleron s customer base and network  as well as aleron s internet access and managed modem services 
acquisition of global access in september  we acquired the majority of the assets of global access telecommunications  inc in exchange for shares of our series l preferred stock 
the series l preferred stock issued in the transaction converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in february global access provided internet access and other data services in germany 
we acquired over customer connections in germany as a result of the acquisition 
acquisition of ufo in august  we acquired certain assets of unlimited fiber optics  inc  or ufo  for  shares of our series k preferred stock 
the preferred stock issued in the merger converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in february among these assets were ufo s customer base  which was comprised of data service customers located in san francisco and los angeles 
the acquired assets also included net cash of approximately million and customer accounts receivable 
acquisition of european network in we expanded our operations into europe through a series of acquisitions in which we acquired customers and extended our network  primarily in france  spain  and germany 
in september  we began exploring the possibility of acquiring lng holdings sa  or lng  an operator of a european telecommunications network that was on the verge of insolvency 
we determined that an acquisition of lng in whole was not advisable at that time  however  the private equity funds that owned lng refused to consider a transaction in which we would acquire only parts of the network 
in order to prevent lng from liquidating and to preserve our ability to structure an acceptable acquisition  in november  our chief executive officer formed a corporation that acquired a interest in lng in return for a commitment to cause at least million to be invested in lng s subsidiary lambdanet france and an indemnification of lng s selling stockholders by us and the acquiring corporation 
in november  we reached an agreement with investment funds associated with bnp paribas and certain of our existing investors regarding the acquisition of the lng networks in france  spain and germany 
we completed the first step of the european network acquisition in january the investors funded a corporation that they controlled with million and acquired firstmark communications participation s 
rl  now named cogent europe s 
rl  from lng for one euro 
cogent europe s 
rl  or cogent europe  is the parent holding company of lambdanet france  now named cogent france  and lambdanet spain  now named cogent spain and our other european subsidiaries 
as consideration  the investors  through the corporation they controlled  entered into a commitment to use reasonable efforts to cause lng to be released from a guarantee of certain obligations of lambdanet france and a commitment to fund lambdanet france with million 
that corporation was then merged into one of our subsidiaries in a transaction in which the investors received  shares of series i preferred stock that converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in february the planned second step of the transaction was the acquisition of the german network of lng 
we attempted to structure an acceptable acquisition that would have entailed using million allocated by the investors to restructure the existing bank debt of lambdanet germany  however  we subsequently concluded that it was unlikely that we could structure an acceptable acquisition of lambdanet germany and we began to seek an alternative german network acquisition in order to complete the european portion of our network and meet the conditions required to cause the investors to fund million 
in march  we identified network assets in germany formerly operated as part of the carrier network as an attractive acquisition opportunity 
pursuant to the november commitment  the investors funded a newly formed delaware corporation with million  and the corporation through a german subsidiary acquired the rights to certain assets of the carrier network in return for million 
that corporation then was merged into one of our subsidiaries  cogent germany  in a transaction in which the investors received shares of our series j preferred stock that converted into approximately million shares of our common stock in february acquisition of fnsi in february  we acquired the assets of fiber network services  inc  or fnsi  an internet service provider in the midwestern united states  in exchange for options to purchase  shares of our common stock and the assumption of certain of fnsi s liabilities 
with the acquisition of fnsi assets we expanded our off net services 
acquisition of psinet in april  we purchased the principal us assets of psinet  inc out of bankruptcy in exchange for million and the assumption of certain liabilities 
with the acquisition of psinet assets we began to offer our off net service and acquired significant non core services 
allied riser merger in february  we acquired allied riser communications corporation  a facilities based provider of broadband data  video and voice communications services to small and medium sized businesses in the united states and canada in exchange for the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
as a result of the merger  allied riser became a wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with the merger  we became co obligor under allied riser s convertible subordinated notes which are due in june results of operations our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our net service revenues and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include net service revenues  which are an indicator of our overall business growth and the success of our sales and marketing efforts  gross profit  which is an indicator of both our service offering mix  competitive pricing pressures and the cost of our network operations  growth in our on net customer base  which is an indicator of the success of our on net focused sales efforts  growth in our on net buildings  and distribution of revenue across our service offerings 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  and with respect to certain key financial measures 
the comparisons illustrated in the table are discussed in greater detail below

net service revenue 
our net service revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  on net  off net and non core revenues represented  and and  and of our net service revenues  respectively 
off net service revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue in as compared to primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of revenue from customers we added through our december acquisition of the off net internet access customers of verio 
our on net revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our on net revenues increased as we increased the number of our on net customer connections from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  notwithstanding the increase in on net revenues  the percentage of on net revenues of total revenues decreased from to due to the increase in off net revenues from the acquisition of the off net internet access customers of verio 
we believe that our on net revenues as a percentage of total revenues will increase as we are allocating the majority of our sales resources toward obtaining additional on net customers 
our off net revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our off net revenues increased as we increased the number of our off net customer connections during primarily from the december verio acquisition 
due primarily to the churn of these acquired customers during  however  our off net customer connections declined from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  we expect that this loss of our off net customer connections will continue 
our non core revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ending december  our non core revenues increased as we added non core managed modem customer connections from our october aleron acquisition and certain non core verio customers in that december acquisition 
the number of our non core customer connections declined from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december  we do not actively market these acquired non core services and expect that the net service revenue associated with them will decline 
our net service revenue related to our acquisitions is included in our statements of operations from the acquisition dates 
acquired net service revenues from our ufo  global access  aleron and verio acquisitions  which occurred in august  september  october and december  respectively  totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   respectively 
this increase is primarily due to the million increase in acquired revenues from the december verio acquisition 
approximately million of our non core cogent europe net service revenue during was derived from network sharing services rendered to lambdanet communications deutschland ag  or lambdanet germany 
lambdanet germany was majority owned by lng holdings until april when it was sold to an unrelated third party 
in the first quarter of  this network sharing arrangement was terminated and there was no such revenue in network operations expenses 
our network operations expenses  excluding the amortization of deferred compensation  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to leased circuits and facilities costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions 
we provide internet connectivity to the acquired customers that are not located in buildings directly connected to our network 
as a result we serve these off net customers using other carriers facilities to provide the last mile portion of the link from our customers premises to our network and incur leased circuit costs to provide these services 
additionally  for the year ended december   cogent europe recorded million of costs associated with using the lambdanet germany network 
in this network sharing arrangement was terminated and there were no such costs in gross profit 
our gross profit  excluding amortization of deferred compensation  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million increase is primarily attributed to our increase in net service revenue 
our gross profit margin expanded from in to for the year ended december  we determine gross profit by subtracting network operation expenses from our net service revenue excluding amortization of deferred compensation 
our gross profit has benefited from the limited incremental expenses associated with providing service to an increasing number of on net customers 
we have not allocated depreciation and amortization expense to our network operations expense 
our gross profit margin may be impacted by the timing and amounts of disputed circuit costs 
we generally record these disputed amounts when billed by the vendor and reverse these amounts when the vendor credit has been received or the dispute has been otherwise resolved 
we believe that our gross profit margin will increase as we are allocating the majority of our sales resources toward obtaining additional on net customers and as sales of these services generate higher gross profit margins than our off net and non core services 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
our sg a expenses  excluding the amortization of deferred compensation  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  sg a expenses increased primarily from the million increase in salaries and related costs required to support our sales effort and an increase of approximately million of auditor fees associated with our sarbanes oxley section compliance requirements 
amortization of deferred compensation 
deferred compensation is primarily related to restricted stock granted to our employees 
the total amortization of deferred compensation increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ending december  the increase is primarily attributed to approximately million of deferred compensation expense recorded in from the grant of additional restricted shares in and the amortization expense related to million of deferred compensation related to options for restricted stock 
these options were granted to certain of our employees in the third quarter of with an exercise price below the trading price of our common stock on the grant date 
we amortize deferred compensation costs on a straight line basis over the service period 
restructuring charges 
in  cogent france re located its paris headquarters

in october  we withdrew this registration statement and expensed the associated deferred costs of approximately million 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
our depreciation and amortization expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributed to a million decrease in the amortization expense of intangible assets  that were fully amortized in in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we revised the number of lease renewal periods used in determining the lease term for purposes of amortizing certain of our leasehold improvements 
this resulted in a net increase in depreciation expense of approximately million 
gains lease obligations  asset sales and debt restructurings 
in  we renegotiated several capital lease obligations for our intra city fiber in france and spain 
these transactions resulted in gains of approximately million recorded as gains on lease obligation restructurings for the year ended december  in march  we sold our building and land located in lyon  france for net proceeds of million

net cash used in financing activities for included million for the repayment of our cisco note  million for the repayment of our subordinated note  million for the repayment of the amount outstanding under our credit facility and million in principal payments under our capital leases 
cash position and indebtedness our total indebtedness  net of discount  at december  was million and our total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million  million of which is restricted 
our total indebtedness at december  includes million of capital lease obligations for dark fiber primarily under year irus  of which approximately million is considered a current liability 
subordinated note on february   we issued a subordinated note in the principal amount of million to columbia ventures corporation in exchange for million in cash 
columbia ventures corporation is owned by one of the company s directors and shareholders 
the terms of the subordinated note required the payment of all principal and accrued interest upon the occurrence of a liquidity event  which was defined as an equity offering of at least million in net proceeds 
our june public offering was considered a liquidity event and in june we repaid the million subordinated note  plus accrued interest of million 
credit facility on march   we entered into a million credit facility with a commercial bank 
the credit facility is secured by our accounts receivable and our other assets 
in december  we modified the credit facility  which increased the available borrowings to up to million and removed a million restricted cash covenant  among other revisions 
the borrowing base is determined primarily by the aging characteristics related to our accounts receivable 
in march  we borrowed million under the credit facility for working capital purposes 
in june  we repaid the million with part of the proceeds of our public offering 
borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at the prime rate plus and may  in certain circumstances  be reduced to the prime rate plus 
our obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
as of december   and since june there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
amended and restated cisco note in connection with the cisco recapitalization  we amended our credit agreement with cisco capital 
our remaining million of indebtedness to cisco was evidenced by a promissory note  which we refer to as the amended and restated cisco note 
we used a portion of the proceeds from our public offering to repay in full the indebtedness under the amended and restated cisco note 
the cisco recapitalization was considered a troubled debt restructuring under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors of troubled debt restructurings 
under sfas no 
 the amended and restated cisco note was recorded at its principal amount of million plus the estimated future interest payments of million 
the estimated future interest was not required to be paid  so the payment of the amended and restated cisco note resulted in a gain of million 
convertible subordinated notes 
in connection with the march exchange and settlement related to our convertible subordinated notes  we eliminated million of principal and million of accrued interest 
the terms of the remaining million of convertible subordinated notes were not impacted by the exchange and settlement and they continue to be due on june  contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations these amounts include million of operating lease  maintenance and license agreement obligations  reduced by sublease agreements of million 
capital lease obligations 
the capital lease obligations above were incurred in connection with our irus for inter city and intra city dark fiber underlying substantial portions of our network 
these capital leases are presented on our balance sheet at the net present value of the future minimum lease payments  or million at december  these leases generally have terms of to years 
letters of credit 
we are also party to letters of credit totaling million at december  these obligations are fully secured by our restricted investments  and as a result  are excluded from the contractual cash obligations above 
future capital requirements we believe that our cash on hand and our availability under our line of credit will be adequate to meet our working capital  capital expenditure  debt service and other cash requirements if we execute our business plan 
our business plan includes increasing our number of on net buildings to approximately  by december  from  at december  and substantially increasing our number of sales representatives in although management believes that we will successfully mitigate our risks  management cannot give any assurances that it will be able to do so or that we will ever operate profitably 
our business plan also assumes  among other things  the following our ability to increase the size of our on net customer base  our capital expenditure rate will continue at a rate similar to the rate we experienced in  we will be able to maintain our recent sales productivity performance and incremental sales product mix  we will be able to locate and hire sales representatives according to our plan  no material change to the conversion rate between the euro and the us dollar and the canadian dollar and the us dollar  no material increase in our revenue churn rate  no material decline in our product pricing  no material increase in our customer bad debt  the continued availability of our line of credit  and our ability to add additional productive buildings to our network 
additionally  any future acquisitions or other significant unplanned costs or cash requirements may require that we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or our stockholders  or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay or scale back the number of buildings that we serve  reduce our planned increase in our sales and marketing efforts  or require us to otherwise alter our business plan or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if issuing equity securities raises additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
we may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the remaining million face value of allied riser notes with cash  stock or assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions  either directly or through intermediaries where we believe that market conditions are favorable to do so 
such purchases may have a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  revenue allowances  long lived assets  accruals  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex  significant and subjective management judgments are discussed below 
we historically have not experienced significant revisions to our estimates except to the extent that they result from changes in estimated litigation accruals  changes in estimated leased circuit obligations  changes in the number of option renewal periods used in determining the lease term for purposes of determining the amortization period for our leasehold improvements  changes in our estimates of the percentage of time our employees were involved in our construction activities and changes in estimated sub lease income which has caused us to revise our lease accruals for abandoned facilities 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenue when the services are performed  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
service discounts and incentives offered to certain customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue when granted 
fees billed in connection with customer installations are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated customer life 
we determine the estimated customer life using a historical analysis of customer retention 
if our estimated customer life increases  we will recognize installation revenue over a longer period 
we expense direct costs associated with sales as incurred 
allowances for sales credits and unfulfilled purchase obligations we have established allowances to account for sales credits and unfulfilled contractual purchase obligations 
our allowance for sales credits is recorded as a reduction to our service revenue to provide for situations when customers are granted a service termination adjustment for amounts billed in advance or a service level agreement credit or discount 
this allowance is determined by actual credits granted during the period and an estimate of unprocessed credits 
our allowance for unfulfilled contractual purchase obligations is designed to account for the possible non payment of amounts under agreements that we have with certain of our customers that place minimum purchase obligations on them 
although we vigorously seek payments due pursuant to these purchase obligations  we have historically collected only a small portion of these billed obligations 
in order to allow for this  we reduce our gross service revenue by the amount that has been invoiced to these customers 
we reduce this allowance and recognize the related service revenue only upon the receipt of cash payments in respect of these invoices 
this allowance is determined by the amount of unfulfilled contractual purchase obligations invoiced to our customers and with respect to which we are continuing to seek payment 
valuation allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and deferred tax assets we have established allowances associated with uncollectible accounts receivable and our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable is designed to account for the expense associated with accounts receivable that we estimate will not be collected 
we assess the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating general factors  such as the length of time individual receivables are past due  historical collection experience  and changes in the credit worthiness of our customers 
we also assess the ability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to us and establish specific allowances based on the amount we expect to collect from these customers 
our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset reflects the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards  including those that we have generated through our operations and those acquired in the allied riser merger could be subject to significant limitations on annual use 
to account for this uncertainty and the uncertainty of future taxable income we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be addressed pursuant to the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
in the event that there are changes in the planned use of our long lived assets  or our expected future undiscounted cash flows are reduced significantly  our assessment of our ability to recover the carrying value of these assets under sfas no 
could change 
because our estimate of undiscounted cash flows generated from these assets exceeds their carrying value for each of the periods presented  no impairment pursuant to sfas no 
existed at december  or business combinations we account for our business combinations pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
under sfas no 
we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
intangible assets are recognized when they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are separable 
we determine estimated fair values using quoted market prices  when available  or by present values of future cash flows discounted at appropriate interest rates 
consideration not in the form of cash is measured based upon the estimated fair value of the consideration given 
we amortize our intangible assets on a straight line basis or using an accelerated method consistent with expected cash flows 
we presently have no intangible assets that are not subject to amortization 
other accounting policies we record assets and liabilities under capital leases at the lesser of the present value of the aggregate future minimum lease payments or the fair value of the assets under lease 
we capitalize the direct costs incurred prior to an asset being ready for service 
these costs include costs under the related construction contract and the salaries and benefits of employees directly involved with construction activities 
our capitalization of these costs is sensitive to the percentage of time and number of our employees involved in construction activities 
we estimate our litigation accruals based upon our estimate of the expected outcome after consultation with legal counsel 
we estimate our accruals for disputed leased circuit obligations based upon the nature and age of the dispute 
our network costs are impacted by the timing and amounts of disputed circuit costs 
we generally record these disputed amounts when billed by the vendor and reverse these amounts when the vendor credit has been received or the dispute has otherwise been resolved 
we estimate the useful lives of our property and equipment based upon historical usage with consideration given to technological changes and trends in the industry that could impact the asset utilization 
we establish the number of renewal option periods used in determining the lease term for amortizing leasehold improvements based upon our assessment at the inception of the lease of the number of option periods that are reasonably assured in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases 
we estimate our restructuring and abandoned lease facilities accruals based upon our estimate of the net present value of cash flows expected from these obligations including expected sub lease income after consideration of market conditions for these and similar properties and the terms of the related lease agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based upon their fair values 
we currently disclose the impact of valuing grants of stock options and recording the related compensation expense in a proforma footnote to our financial statements 
for disclosure purposes  employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method and compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period for the entire award 
under sfas r this alternative is no longer available 
we will be required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of and as a result will record additional compensation expense in our statements of operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss income in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we plan on using the modified prospective method of adoption under sfas r and we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
our primary market risk exposure is related to interest rate fluctuations that affect our marketable securities and certain of our debt instruments and currency fluctuations of the euro and the canadian dollar versus the united states dollar 
we place our marketable security investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
marketable securities were approximately million at december   million of which are considered cash and cash equivalents and mature in days or less and million are short term investments  which are restricted for collateral against letters of credit 
we also hold certificates of deposit totaling million that are classified as other long term assets and are also restricted for collateral against letters of credit 
our debt obligations at december   with the exception of our accounts receivable credit facility  carry fixed interest rates and the related cash flows are not subject to changes in interest rates 
our million credit facility is indexed to the prime rate plus and may  in certain circumstances be reduced to the prime rate plus 
there were no amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable credit facility at december  the allied riser convertible subordinated notes are due in june have a face value of million 
the notes were recorded at their fair value of approximately million at the merger date 
the resulting discount is being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date using the effective interest rate method 
based upon the borrowing rates for debt arrangements with similar terms we estimate the fair value of our allied riser convertible subordinated notes at million 
if there were a increase in interest rates we estimate that this fair value would be million 
our european and canadian operations expose us to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risk 
for example  while we record revenues and financial results from our european and canadian operations in euros and the canadian dollar  respectively  these results are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
the assets and liabilities associated with our european and canadian operations are translated into us dollars and reflected in our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
therefore  our reported results are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro and the canadian dollar 
in addition  we fund the euro based operating expenses and associated cash flow requirements of our european operations  including iru obligations  in us dollars 
accordingly  in the event that the euro strengthens versus the dollar to a greater extent  the expenses and cash flow requirements associated with our european operations may be significantly higher in us dollar terms than planned
