legal reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings resulting from lawsuits and arbitrations  which arise from its business activities 
some of these lawsuits and arbitrations claim substantial amounts  including punitive damage claims 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the claimant will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims 
the company has  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimant plaintiff  the merits of the claim  the amount of loss in the client s account  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of the employee of the company  the total cost of defending the litigation  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve

investment securities of registered broker dealer subsidiaries are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  is based on management s estimates 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term 
income tax matters the provision for state income taxes and related tax reserves is based on management s consideration of known liabilities and tax contingencies 
known liabilities are amounts that will appear on current tax returns  amounts that have been agreed to in revenue agent revisions as the result of examinations by the state taxing authorities  and amounts that will follow from such examinations but affect years other than those being examined 
tax contingencies are liabilities that might arise from a successful challenge by the state taxing authorities taking a contrary position or interpretation regarding the application of tax law to the company s tax return filings
