approximately million of under performing securities were sold 
as a result of this action  a pre tax loss of  was incurred  which reduced earnings per share for the year by 
in addition to the aforementioned loss recorded in the fourth quarter  the company incurred certain costs related to the acquisition of madison and the consolidation of the company s other indiana banking affiliates 
in total  these costs amounted to on a pre tax basis  or per share on an after tax basis 
the company s earnings per share for also include the addition of two million shares of common stock issued in its public offering in june and july of the offering negatively impacted earnings per share by in as the company was not able to fully utilize the new capital generated from the offering until the close of its acquisition of madison  which occurred on august  therefore  on an operating basis  the company s earnings per share would have been for the full year or basically flat when compared to the same period a year ago

service charges increased primarily due to the increase in overall account levels from acquisitions 
other income increased due to death benefits on bank owned life insurance  the establishment of the title insurance agency  an increase in annuity sales  the acquisition of madison  and the full year effect of the peoples trust acquisition in june insurance commissions decreased as the company disposed of the kentucky division of its insurance subsidiary in the first quarter of non interest income was relatively flat in compared to the acquisition of peoples trust and increased service charge income related to the company s overdraft program were offset by decreases in mortgage banking activity and lower gains on sales of investment securities

non interest expense total non interest expense increased in to  compared to  in  an increase of  the largest component of non interest expense in both years was salaries and employee benefits

the total restructuring costs incurred in were income taxes the effective tax rate was in  in  and in the decrease in the company s effective tax rate in was primarily related to an increase in tax free income from state and municipal securities and an increase in tax free income related to bank owned life insurance policies 
balance sheet at december   total assets were  compared to  at december   an increase of  the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of madison  which accounted for approximately million in assets 
the company used a portion of the cash received in this acquisition to reduce the overall level of its borrowings 
loans  credit risk and the allowance and provision for loan losses loans remain the company s largest concentration of assets and continue to represent the greatest potential risk 
the loan underwriting standards observed by the company s subsidiaries are viewed by management as a means of controlling problem loans and the resulting charge offs 
the company s conservative loan underwriting standards have historically resulted in higher loan quality and generally lower levels of net charge offs than peer group averages 
the company also believes credit risks may be elevated if undue concentrations of loans in specific industry segments and to out of area borrowers are incurred 
accordingly  the company s board of directors regularly monitors such concentrations to determine compliance with its loan concentration policy 
the company believes it has no undue concentrations of loans 
total loans excluding those held for sale increased by  from year end the increase was primarily related to the acquisition of madison  which added  in net loans 
excluding the acquisition of madison  the company s total loan portfolio decreased by  this decrease was due primarily to pay offs of approximately  in the company s hotel loan portfolio 
residential real estate loans continue to represent the largest portion of the total loan portfolio

loans are placed on non accrual status when  in management s judgment  the collateral value and or the borrower s financial condition does not justify accruing interest 
as a general rule  commercial and real estate loans are reclassified to nonaccrual status at or before becoming days past due 
interest previously recorded is reversed and charged against current income 
subsequent interest payments collected on nonaccrual loans are thereafter applied as a reduction of the loan s principal balance

this watch list  together with a listing of all classified loans  nonaccrual loans and delinquent loans  is reviewed monthly by the board of directors of each subsidiary 
additionally  the company evaluates its consumer and residential real estate loan pools for probable losses incurred based on historical trends  adjusted by current delinquency and non performing loan levels 
the ability to absorb loan losses promptly when problems are identified is invaluable to a banking organization 
most often  losses incurred as a result of prompt  aggressive collection actions are much lower than losses incurred after prolonged legal proceedings 
accordingly  the company observes the practice of quickly initiating stringent collection efforts in the early stages of loan delinquency 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses in each subsidiary is reviewed at least quarterly 
the determination of the provision amount in any period is based upon management s continuing review and evaluation of loan loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  classified loans including non accrual and impaired loans  current economic conditions  the amount of loans presently outstanding  and the amount and composition of loan growth 
the company s allowance for loan losses was  or of total loans  at december  compared to  or of total loans  at the end of the reduction in non performing loans supports the decrease in the overall level of the allowance for loan losses 
the acquisition of madison resulted in an addition to the allowance for loan losses of  as of december  management was evaluating the appropriate level of allowance consistent with the probable incurred loss of the portfolio acquired 
this acquired allowance is subject to adjustments in the future as part of the finalization of purchase accounting 
securities securities offer flexibility in the company s management of interest rate risk  and are the primary means by which the company provides liquidity and responds to changing maturity characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the company s investment policy prohibits trading activities and does not allow investment in high risk derivative products or junk bonds 
as of december   all of the securities are classified as available for sale afs and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
a net unrealized loss of  was recorded to adjust the afs portfolio to current market value at december  compared to a net unrealized gain of at december  investment securities carrying values at december within year yrs yrs beyond years total available for sale federal agencies state and municipal mortgage backed securities equity and other securities total available for sale weighted average yield adjusted to reflect income related to securities exempt from federal income taxes amounts in the table above are based on scheduled maturity dates 
variable interest rates are subject to change not less than annually based upon certain interest rate indices 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
as of december   there were no corporate bonds and other securities which represent more than of shareholders equity

the average life of the company s investment security portfolio was years at december  during the investment portfolio shifted from a shorter than average duration to a slightly longer than average duration when compared to the company s average targeted duration 
this move was in direct response to the aggressive move up in short term interest rates as the federal reserve increased rates throughout the duration extension allowed the portfolio to improve its yield performance throughout the year 
at the end of management determined that a selective divestiture of underperforming securities would better position the portfolio for the future 
the transaction resulted in a one time pre tax loss on sale of  that is expected to be recovered in the next months 
entering the portfolio is now positioned to provide consistent yield performance and stable cash flows for reinvestment 
management anticipates that the portfolio will likely maintain its current duration and expects limited changes to its overall yield performance 
sources of funds the company relies primarily on customer deposits and securities sold under agreement to repurchase repurchase agreements  along with shareholders equity to fund earning assets 
federal home loan bank fhlb advances are used to provide additional funding 
the company also attempts to obtain deposits through branch acquisitions 
deposits generated within local markets provide the major source of funding for earning assets 
average total deposits were and of total average earning assets in and  respectively 
total interest bearing deposits averaged and of average total deposits during and management is continuing efforts to increase the percentage of transaction related deposits to total deposits due to the positive effect on earnings 
repurchase agreements are high denomination investments utilized by public entities and commercial customers as an element of their cash management responsibilities 
during  repurchase agreements averaged  another source of funding is the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company had fhlb advances of  outstanding at december  these advances have interest rates ranging from to see note to the consolidated financial statements for the maturity schedule of these advances 
the company averaged  in fhlb advances during compared to  during average deposits amount rate amount rate amount rate demand interest bearing demand savings money markets certificates of deposit totals as of december   certificates of deposit and other time deposits of or more mature as follows months or less months months over months total amount percent capital resources the federal reserve board and other regulatory agencies have adopted risk based capital guidelines that assign risk weightings to assets and off balance sheet items 
the company s core capital tier consists of common shareholders equity adjusted for unrealized gains or losses on available for sale afs securities plus limited amounts of trust preferred securities less goodwill and intangible assets 
total capital consists of core capital  certain debt instruments and a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   tier capital to average assets was 
total capital to risk weighted assets was 
both ratios exceed all required ratios established for bank holding companies 
risk adjusted capital levels of each of the company s subsidiary banks exceed regulatory definitions of well capitalized institutions 
the trust preferred securities which are classified as subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital or core capital with respect to the company under the risk based capital guidelines established by the federal reserve 
under such guidelines  capital received from the proceeds of the sale of these securities cannot constitute more than of the total tier capital of the company 
consequently  the amount of trust preferred securities in excess of the limitation constitutes tier capital  or supplementary capital  of the company 
as of december   all of the company s trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital 
common shareholders equity is impacted by the company s decision to categorize its securities portfolio as available for sale afs 
securities in this category are carried at fair value  and common shareholders equity is adjusted to reflect unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes 
the company declared and paid common dividends of

book value per common share increased to at december  compared to at the end of the net adjustment for afs securities decreased book value per share by 
at december  and increased book value per share by 
at december  depending on market conditions  the adjustment for afs securities can cause significant fluctuations in equity 
liquidity liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient cash levels to fund operations and to meet the requirements of borrowers  depositors and creditors 
higher levels of liquidity bear higher corresponding costs  measured in terms of lower yields on short term  more liquid earning assets and higher interest expense involved in extending liability maturities 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  loans and securities maturing within one year and money market instruments 
in addition  the company holds approximately million of afs securities maturing after one year  which can be sold to meet liquidity needs 
maintaining a relatively stable funding base  which is achieved by diversifying funding sources  supports liquidity  extends the contractual maturity of liabilities  and limits reliance on volatile short term purchased funds 
short term funding needs may arise from declines in deposits or other funding sources  funding of loan commitments and requests for new loans 
the company s strategy is to fund assets to the maximum extent possible with core deposits  which provide a sizable source of relatively stable low cost funds 
the company defines core deposits as all deposits except certificates of deposits greater than average core deposits funded approximately of total earning assets during and approximately in management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet all reasonable borrower  depositor and creditor needs in the present economic environment 
the company has not received any directives from regulatory authorities that would materially affect liquidity  capital resources or operations 
contractual obligations as of december  less than more than total year years years years time deposits fhlb advances subordinated debentures total interest rate sensitivity at year end  the company held approximately million in assets comprised of securities  loans  short term investments  and federal funds sold  which were interest rate sensitive in one year or less time horizons 
the company s interest rate sensitivity analysis for the year ended december  appears in the table below 
a significant assumption that creates the large negative gap in the to month category is that all interest bearing demand and savings accounts are subject to immediate repricing 
while it is true that  contractually  those accounts are subject to immediate repricing  the rates paid on those accounts are generally not tied to specific indices and are influenced by market conditions and other factors 
accordingly  a general movement in interest rates  either up or down  may not have any immediate effect on the rates paid on these deposit accounts 
the following table illustrates only one source of information about sensitivity to interest rate movements 
our asset and liability management process also uses simulations that take into account the time that various assets and liabilities may reprice and the degree to which various categories of such assets and liabilities will respond to general interest rate movements 
interest rate risk can only be represented by a measurement of the effects of changing interest rates given the capacity for and magnitude of change on specific assets and liabilities

short term interest rates rose significantly in as the federal reserve increased rates in response to a maturing economic expansion 
the company was able to increase its margin in this environment but increased deposit pricing competition will likely pressure this trend in the company continues to monitor the repricing characteristics of its balance sheet so as to maintain an acceptable net interest margin during interest rate fluctuations 
assuming a stable to moderately higher interest rate environment  the company does not foresee its earnings materially impacted for asset liability management strategies are developed by the company to manage market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss in financial instruments including investments  loans  deposits and borrowings arising from adverse changes in prices rates 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk exposure and represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
the following table provides information about the company s significant financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
the table presents only a static measurement of asset and liability volumes based on maturity  cash flow estimates and interest rates 
it does not reflect the differences in the timing and degree of repricing of assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes

the company cannot make any assurances as to the outcome of these assumptions  nor can it assess the impact of customer product preference changes and competitive factors as well as other internal and external variables 
in addition  this analysis cannot reflect actions taken by the asset liability management committees  therefore  this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of expected operating results 
effects of changing prices the company s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial company in that most of its assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
management believes the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the company s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction at the same time  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
as discussed previously  management relies on its ability to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
these policies require estimates and assumptions 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
in management s opinion  some of these areas have a more significant impact than others on the company s financial reporting 
these areas currently include accounting for the allowance for loan losses and goodwill 
allowance for loan losses the level of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolios  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay including the timing of future payments  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the level of allowance maintained is believed by management to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by charge offs  net of recoveries of amounts previously charged off 
goodwill statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations and no 
goodwill and other intangible assets were issued in june of and were effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  if any  will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
the company has selected june as its date for annual impairment testing
