item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview consumer healthcare savings solutions 
we offer savings on healthcare services throughout the united states to persons who are under insured 
these savings are offered by accessing the same preferred provider organizations ppos that are utilized by many insurance companies 
these programs are sold primarily through a network marketing strategy under the name care entr e 
we design these programs to benefit healthcare providers as well as the network members 
providers commonly give reduced or preferred rates to ppo networks in exchange for steerage of patients 
however  the providers must still file claim forms and wait to days to be paid for their services 
our programs utilize these same networks to obtain the same savings for the care entr e program members 
however  the healthcare providers are paid immediately for their services and are not required to file claim forms 
we provide transaction facilitation services to both the program member and the healthcare provider 
our independent marketing representatives imrs may enroll as representatives by paying an enrollment fee and signing a standard representative agreement 
we pay independent marketing representatives commissions equal to of the membership fees of members they enroll for the life of that members enrollment 
independent marketing representatives can also recruit other representatives and earn override commissions on sales made by those recruited representatives 
we pay a total of up to in override commissions down through seven levels 
independent marketing representatives can also earn a commission equal to the membership fees if three or more program members are enrolled in a month 
in the month of membership sales  no override commissions are paid to the representative s upline 
the total regular or ongoing commissions payout  including overrides on monthly membership sales after the enrollment month and our contribution to the bonus pools  is up to of qualified membership sales 
we also design healthcare membership programs for employer groups and third party marketers 
memberships in these programs are offered and sold by direct marketing through direct sales or in bound direct marketing 
we believe that our clients  their members and the vendors of the products and services offered through the programs  all benefit from our membership service programs 
the products and services are bundled  priced and marketed utilizing relationship marketing strategies or inbound direct marketing to target the profiled needs of the clients particular member base 
our memberships sold by third party organizations are generally marketed using the third party s name or brand or under our wholesale brand for your good health 
we refer to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs or private label programs 
while the services offered to consumers by these private label programs are generally similar to the services we offer through care entr e  each of the private label programs can bundle our services to fit the needs of their consumers 
for instance  some of our private label programs do not offer a self funded escrow program to their members 
employer and group healthcare services for governments and other large  self funded employers seeking to reduce the cost of offering healthcare benefits to their employees  we offer a more streamlined version of our healthcare products and programs 
in these cases  we offer access to healthcare through our network of providers and the efficient repricing of bills through our proprietary systems 
we can offer these services on a price based on either the number of participants per month or as a percentage of savings on healthcare costs actually realized 
with our acquisition of access in june  we provide a wide range of healthcare claims administration services and other cost containment procedures that are frequently required by governments and other employers who have chosen to self fund their healthcare benefits requirements 
with the services of access  we offer a more complete suite of healthcare services 
we are able to provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical escrow accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
from a sales distribution standpoint  we have the ability to grow access regional business through our numerous independent marketing representatives who sell both to individuals and employer groups throughout the united states 
access primary area of expertise is in the public sector market 
financial services in september  we organized our wholly owned subsidiary care financial of texas  llc through care financial  we offer our high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies 
in addition  we have recently added a suite of products including life insurance and annuities  along with healthcare savings accounts hsas  healthcare reimbursement arrangements hras and medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts fsas offered through care  a division of foresight inc 
the high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies  hras and medical and dependent care fsas  when combined with the care entr e program  offer affordable  well rounded solutions for individuals and employers who are no longer able to afford or obtain traditional health insurance policies 
the hras and medical and dependent care fsas are also sold by our independent marketing representatives who  from a regulatory standpoint  are not required to be licensed to sell these products 
the life insurance products serve to complement our healthcare product offerings by addressing our members overall financial condition 
the insurance policies are sold through our independent marketing representatives who are licensed insurance agents 
rental purchase and club membership programs discontinued until december   we also designed club membership programs for rental purchase companies  financial organizations  employer groups  retailers and association based organizations 
memberships in these programs were offered and sold as part of a point of sale transaction or by direct marketing through direct mail or as inserts 
program members are offered and provided our third party vendors products and services 
the products and services were bundled  priced and marketed to target the profiled needs of the clients particular customer base 
most of our club membership programs were sold by third party organizations  generally in connection with a point of sale transaction 
we refer to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs 
revenues from these programs have represented a lesser portion of our revenues in recent years than in the past 
in december  we sold substantially all of the assets of this subsidiary and discontinued its operations 
operational review the year ended december  was another year of significant challenge 
we implemented member escrow accounts during the fourth quarter of in response to the market changes in the healthcare savings industry  and on october   we expanded the escrow requirements to all programs offering access to medical doctors and physicians 
as a result of this change  we required all of our members other than those whose memberships are sold by our private label partners to fund and maintain personal medical accounts pmas to provide the healthcare providers with a form of payment assurance prior to receipt of healthcare services 
as of december   the percentage of our individual members who have escrowed funds with us was approximately of the total individual healthcare membership base 
this excludes our private label programs  where the escrow requirements have not been mandated 
our healthcare membership base was approximately  members as of december   as compared to  members as of december  and  members as of december   a decrease of approximately  members or during the reduction in our healthcare membership base resulted from declining market share in the healthcare savings market  due in part to the implementation of the required pmas  as well as provider acceptance issues in some markets 
additionally  we lost a significant wholesale private label customer in mid also  our independent marketing representative base experienced a significant reduction in through although the personal medical account requirements implemented in late negatively impacted our membership base and consequently our revenues and net earnings in and  these changes were required to help provide assurance of payment to the healthcare providers and accordingly  their continued willingness to provide healthcare services to our members 
this strategic move was thought to be critical to our long term operational and financial viability in the health card savings market as many healthcare providers throughout the united states were reluctant to accept a health discount card 
the success of our new healthcare product offering has been mixed 
the growth of our members escrow or cash in trust to  as of december  from  as of december  provides preliminary although not conclusive evidence of some degree of acceptance of this form of medical savings product offering 
in order to address the issues of assurance of payment to the providers and acceptance of the discount cards by those providers  we have recently explored alternative products 
we have developed a line of affordable insurance products that are sometimes referred to as scheduled benefit  limited benefit or defined benefit policies 
these products are much less expensive than traditional comprehensive healthcare insurance and usually do not require the member to undergo any underwriting 
as such  they are available to all individuals  regardless of health condition 
the policies usually operate on an indemnity basis  reimbursing the member for certain of his or her incurred costs 
sometimes  the policies allow the benefit to be assigned directly to the provider  eliminating the need for the member to pay the provider directly and then seek reimbursement 
these policies pay a certain amount for services 
for instance  a member could choose a program entitled him or her to  or  per day of hospitalization  with additional scheduled benefits for intensive care stays and surgery  for up to days 
the sale of some of these programs requires an insurance license 
in this case  we will sell them only through our representatives that hold the appropriate license 
some of these programs  however  will be offered at no cost to the member as part of the member s enrollment in an association 
in this case  the sale of the membership does not require a license in most states 
we commenced sales of these new products in the first quarter of while it is too early to assess the market acceptance of these new products  it is hoped that they will address the issues of assurance of payment to the providers and acceptance of the discount cards by those providers more successfully than the escrow or pma products 
our operating results benefited from the acquisition of access in june of while included in operations for only slightly more than six months during  access contributed  or to our revenue and  of net earnings after taxes to partially offset our other losses 
in  access contributed revenues of  and net earnings after taxes of  access has successfully secured multi year contracts on favorable terms with its two largest clients and has brought us a stable source of revenue 
moreover  we have realized certain intangible benefits from the acquisition 
for instance  we have broadened the management responsibilities of several members of access management team to company wide roles 
our new chief operating officer  frank apodaca  is the president and chief executive officer of access and he will be implementing  on a company wide basis  operational controls that have been successful at access 
in  we introduced vergance  a new network marketing distribution channel that is a division of precis 
vergance offers wellness products  including nutraceuticals under the retail name natrience  and discounted healthcare services under the retail name quickcare 
vergance did not materially contribute to our revenues in more information on its results is contained throughout this report 
vergance is essentially a start up operation 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred total net costs associated with this new operation of  we are monitoring its progress in critical accounting policies revenue recognition healthcare membership revenues we recognize our care entr e program membership revenues  other than initial enrollment fees  on each monthly anniversary date 
membership revenues are reduced by the amount of estimated refunds 
for members that are billed directly  the billed amount is collected almost entirely by electronic charge to the members credit cards  automated clearinghouse or electronic check 
the settlement of those charges occurs within a day or two 
under certain private label arrangements  our private label partners bill their members for the membership fees and our portion of the membership fees is periodically remitted to us 
during the time from the billing of these private label membership fees and the remittance to us  we record a receivable from the private label partners and record an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the allowance of uncollectible receivables is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances  the credit worthiness of the private label partner and its history of paying the agreed amounts owed 
membership enrollment fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the estimated membership period that averages eight to ten months 
independent marketing representative fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the term of the applicable contract 
judgment is involved in the allocation of costs to determine the direct costs netted against those deferred revenues  as well as in estimating the membership period over which to amortize such net revenue 
we maintain a statistical analysis of the costs and membership periods as a basis for adjusting these estimates from time to time 
access third party administration access principal sources of revenues include administrative fees for third party claims administration  network provider fees for the preferred provider network and utilization and management fees 
these fees are based on monthly or per member per month fee schedules under specified contractual agreements 
revenues from these services are recognized in the periods in which the services are performed and when collection is reasonably assured 
commission expense commissions are paid to our independent marketing representatives in the month following the month in which a member has enrolled in or renewed our care entr e program 
commissions are only paid in the following month when we have received the related monthly membership fees 
we do not pay advanced commissions on membership sales 
commissions are based on established commission schedules and are determined and accrued based upon the recognition of the related healthcare membership revenue  as described above 
acquisitions as discussed above  in  we acquired access for  that includes  of goodwill   of contracts acquired   of working capital and  of fixed assets  offset by  of deferred tax liability 
furthermore  we agreed to make additional purchase price payments and stock deliveries if access were to achieve and exceed certain operating performance levels 
additional consideration of  was paid in april based on access first quarter performance   was paid in july based on access second quarter performance   was paid in october based upon access third quarter performance and  was accrued at december  based upon access fourth quarter performance 
additional acquisition costs consisting of contingent transaction fees of  were also accrued at december  and recorded as an addition to goodwill 
the increased purchase price was recorded as a  addition to goodwill  increasing goodwill attributable to the access acquisition to  at december  from  at december  the allocation of  to goodwill including amounts recorded at the initial closing is considered appropriate  as access strategically complements the company s healthcare service offering 
fixed assets property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term 
the estimation of useful lives is based  in part  upon past experience with similar assets and upon our plans for the utilization of the assets in the future 
we periodically review fixed assets  including software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated 
when any value impairment is determined to exist  the related assets are written down to their fair value 
if we determine that the remaining useful life  based upon known events and circumstances  should be shortened  the depreciation or amortization of the related asset is adjusted on a prospective  going forward basis based upon the shortened useful lives 
intangible asset valuation our intangible assets as of december   consisted primarily of  of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized 
additionally  intangible assets include  of contracts  net of amortization  acquired as part of our acquisition of access 
during the year ended december   our intangible assets were reduced by  to reflect impairment of the goodwill related to our acquisition in of foresight  inc due to the continuing decline in members and revenues of the consumer healthcare savings segment to a lower level than management had previously predicted and the pending litigation and regulatory activity that was announced in the second quarter of  we completed an impairment test of the goodwill as of june  significant judgments and estimates were required in connection with the impairment test to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit 
an independent valuation consultant was engaged by the company to estimate fair values for that reporting unit using discounted cash flow projections and other valuation methodologies in evaluating and measuring a potential impairment charge 
based upon management s cash flow projections and the consultant s independent valuation  the company recorded a goodwill impairment related to the capella group  inc of  in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of a second analysis was performed based on a revised forecast which resulted in the booking of an additional goodwill impairment of  to the extent that  in the future  our estimates change or our stock price decreases  further goodwill write downs may occur 
those assessments of the carrying value of goodwill were each reviewed and approved by our audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
during  we evaluated the probability of recognizing the benefit of deferred tax assets through the reduction of taxes otherwise payable in the future and increased the allowance by  to  against the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets because in our opinion it is more probable than not that some of those assets will not be realized 
in december  we entered into several tax motivated transactions with the goal of maximizing refunds which will be received in early from carryback of tax deductions taken in against income taxes previously paid in reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
results of operations consumer healthcare savings the operating results for our consumer healthcare savings segment were as follows for the twelve months ended december dollars in thousands  percent change dollar change percent change dollar change revenues     operating expenses cost of operations    sales and marketing    general and administrative    total operating expenses    operating income    for the twelve months ended december  percent of revenues revenues operating expenses cost of operations sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
revenues 
our consumer healthcare savings programs having been under continuing pressure from increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny  as well as the unwillingness of some healthcare providers to accept our savings cards based on concerns over assurance of payment 
in late  we implemented an escrow account requirement to address provider concerns over assurance of payment 
while this feature has shown success in improving acceptance by providers  it has made our programs more complex and difficult to sell 
as of december   the percentage of our individual members who have escrowed funds with us was approximately of the total individual healthcare membership base 
this excludes our private label programs  where the escrow requirements have not been mandated 
in some of the states in which we have a significant number of members  especially florida  texas and california  our healthcare savings products are under scrutiny and criticism by state regulators and officials 
this regulatory scrutiny has impaired our ability to market these products in those states and elsewhere  further contributing to the decline in membership enrollments and increases in terminated memberships 
the table below reflects the decline in our consumer healthcare savings program membership over the preceding months care entr e membership count at end of quarter st qtr nd qtr rd qtr th qtr st qtr nd qtr rd qtr th qtr member count      percent change average revenue per member  net of sales and marketing costs the drop in average revenue per member  net of sales and marketing costs  in the fourth quarter of is primarily the result if a  increase in consulting costs related to fourth quarter sales and marketing initiatives 
although the implementation of escrow requirements negatively impacted our membership base and consequently our revenues and net earnings in and  the escrow requirements were necessary to provide some assurance of payment to the healthcare providers and  accordingly  their continued willingness to provide healthcare services to our members 
this strategic move was critical to our long term operational and financial viability in the health card savings market  as many healthcare providers throughout the united states will no longer accept a health discount card 
we are currently exploring additional alternatives that may address the healthcare providers concerns related to assurance of payment and that may be better received by potential members as well as our current members 
the likelihood of success of new healthcare product offerings is difficult to predict 
therefore  the long term impact  whether favorable or unfavorable  of the introduction of a new or restructured healthcare savings product on revenues and net earnings may remain unknown for a substantial period following their introduction 
the growth of our members escrow or cash in trust to  as of december  from  as of december  and from  as of december   provides some indication that  while overall memberships have continued to decline  those members who do participate in the escrow based form of our healthcare savings program continue to increase their escrow deposits with us 
throughout  we have continued the measures and initiatives commenced earlier in the year to improve our operating efficiencies and performance  especially through cost reductions 
these measures and initiatives include i the integration of access management members with our management team  as mentioned  ii the termination of certain equipment capital leases  iii personnel reductions and other cost reduction actions  iv the exploration of additional products to compliment our core healthcare savings product  and v the providing additional compensatory incentives to our independent marketing representatives 
these measures have successfully reduced the cost structure associated with our care entr e and private label membership programs 
we believe the annualized estimated cost savings will be significant 
during the first quarter of  we resumed sales of our consumer healthcare savings products to a private label reseller who  in early  had discontinued sales of those products 
that  together with other improvements in the sales of those products  has led to increases in new enrollments such that  as of the last half of that first quarter of  the decline in memberships appears  for now  to have ended 
cost of operations 
the decrease in cost of operations was primarily due to reductions in fixed costs of  primarily related to termination of certain equipment leases  described above  as well as decreased variable costs of  primarily due to decreased provider network and bank fees related to decreased revenue in our consumer healthcare savings segment 
additionally  we wrote off  of unreserved trade and note receivables from certain of our private label partners in the fourth quarter of the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to of is primarily due to the provision charge for doubtful accounts in and increase in additional processing costs of  to administer escrow and claims processing 
sales and marketing expenses 
the decreases in sales and marketing expenses from to and from to were primarily due to decreases in commissions related to the decreased membership revenue of the care entr e program 
these commission decreases were accentuated by the departure of independent marketing representatives from the upper ranks of our multi level marketing network through which our care entr e program is offered and elimination of the associated over ride commissions  resulting in a lower percentage of commissions as a percent of revenue 
the decrease from to was partially offset by  of personnel severance costs incurred during the decrease from to also includes decreases in sales staff and consulting costs of  other commission incentive programs of  and regional conventions of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses declined from to due to the cost reduction measures discussed above  primarily related to reductions in employees and the associated salaries and benefits 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from to is primarily related to salary increases  severances and contract staff of  legal fees and settlements of  depreciation and amortization of  charitable contributions of  business development advertising of  and increased expense on leased equipment of  employer and group healthcare services the operating results for our employer and group healthcare services segment were as follows for the twelve months ended december dollars in thousands  percent change dollar change percent change dollar change revenues     operating expenses cost of operations     sales and marketing general and administrative    total operating expenses    operating income   for the twelve months ended december  percent of revenue revenues operating expenses cost of operations sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
revenues 
the primary element of our employer and group healthcare services segment is our wholly owned subsidiary  access healthsource  inc access  which we acquired in june  through which we offer full third party administration services 
through access we provide a wide range of healthcare claims administration services and other cost containment procedures that are frequently required by state and local governmental entities and other large employers that have chosen to self fund their required healthcare benefits 
access helps us offer a more complete suite of healthcare service products 
also through access  we provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical escrow accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
employer and group healthcare services revenues during increased primarily because results of operations for access were only included since the date of its acquisition on june  had access results of operations been included throughout and  revenues for this segment would have been  for and  for  while operating income would have been  for and  for the increases of pro forma revenues and operating income during those years resulted primarily from the addition of a new service contract and expansion of services to two existing customers 
cost of operations 
cost of operations for the employer and group healthcare services segment increased primarily as the result of the increased revenue discussed above 
the cost of operations as a percent of revenue decreased percentage points as the result of the new service contract that allows our fixed cost of operations to be spread over more revenue dollars 
further contributing to the percentage decrease was the automation of claims processing which reduced our salary and related costs as a percentage of revenue 
as such  we were able to generate a corresponding increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the employer and group healthcare services segment are negligible  as access maintains direct relationships with its large self funded clients in the el paso market and does not utilize advertising or outside sales forces 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues declined as certain expenses remained relatively fixed  while revenues increased 
financial services the operating results for our financial services segment were as follows for the twelve months ended december dollars in thousands  percent change dollar change percent change dollar change revenues operating expenses cost of operations n a sales and marketing general and administrative  total operating expenses  operating loss  for the twelve months ended december  percent of revenues revenues operating expenses cost of operations sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
our revenues from sales of annuities and life insurance policies by our network marketing representatives increased from to as we grew this new segment of our operations 
unfortunately  such revenues were not sufficient to recover costs that we were incurring to launch and manage this business 
during  we reduced the costs associated with this segment  as we moved toward an agency arrangement that will substantially reduce our fixed operating costs and discontinued the consulting arrangement related to the management of the insurance sales force 
these efforts continued through the end of and have resulted in significantly lower operating losses for our financial services segment 
corporate the operating costs for our corporate activities were as follows for the twelve months ended december dollars in thousands  percent change dollar change percent change dollar change general and administrative   goodwill impairment    total operating expenses    certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for included a  charge resulting from severance compensation payable to some of our former officers 
the increase in general and administrative expenses also related to increased costs associated with auditing fees of  and investor relations expenses of  impairment of goodwill 
as discussed above see critical accounting policies intangible asset valuation  during we recorded an impairment loss related to the capella group  inc and its care entr e program of  this impairment charge was not allocated to the consumer healthcare savings segment

this segment has not been a core element of our strategic plans for some time  but efforts have been made to maintain or moderately grow the segment s revenues  while significantly reducing its costs 
from to  the small increase in revenue was primarily related to increased volume from existing dealers and a new dealer that was signed in may the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to commissions due on the increased revenue described above 
general and administrative expenses for included personnel reductions related to management cost reduction initiatives 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to management cost reduction initiatives 
in december  we sold substantially all of the assets of this segment and discontinued its operation  resulting in a gain on disposal of  net of taxes 
results of operations for this segment have been reflected as discontinued operations 
recent management initiatives during the fourth quarter of and throughout  we undertook certain initiatives to reverse our declining revenues and achieve a decrease in operating expenses 
these measures and initiatives include i the integration of access management members with our management team  as mentioned above  ii the termination of certain equipment capital leases  iii personnel reductions and other cost reduction actions  iv the exploration of additional products to compliment our core healthcare savings product  and v the providing additional compensatory incentives to our independent marketing representatives 
the results of operations for reflect some significant results from those efforts  as previously discussed 
income tax provision sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires the separate recognition  measured at currently enacted tax rates  of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
the majority of the cumulative deferred tax asset as of december  was realized during by carryback of deductions taken for federal income tax purposes in against taxes previously paid in a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion will not be realized 
at december  and  we had deferred tax benefits of  after allowance and  respectively  resulting in large part from net operating loss carryforwards that  if not utilized  will expire at various dates through in  we also had a deferred tax liability of  which offsets the non current deferred tax asset 
the cumulative net deferred tax asset as of december  and was and  respectively 
a valuation allowance of  was established during to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that  in our opinion  is more likely than not realizable 
if we continue to incur net operating losses  an additional valuation allowance may need to be established 
valuation allowance adjustments have a direct impact on net income loss in the amount of the allowance 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively  a decrease of  from to the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the net loss during the period partially offset by receipt of an income tax refund of  and recovery of irs penalties of  additionally  there were  of prepaid expenses recorded at year end  the majority of which will be utilized the first quarter of these expenses were prepaid as part of year end income tax reduction strategies  as discussed above 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december    and was   and  respectively  and during   and  respectively related primarily to our acquisition of access including contingent consideration paid and delivered during  as described previously

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for and  for during  net cash used in financing activities was primarily for payments on capital equipment leases of  and repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  at december  and  we had working capital of  and  respectively 
this decline is due primarily due to contingent consideration attributable to the access acquisition 
other than our  capital lease obligations and our potential payment and delivery obligations associated with the access acquisition which are unknown as of the date of this report  we do not have any capital commitments 
we do not anticipate that our capital expenditures for will exceed the amount incurred during we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  and cash provided by operations  will be sufficient to fund our normal operations and capital expenditures for the next months 
because our capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there is no assurance that we will not require any additional financing during the next months  and if required  that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or advantageous to our stockholders
