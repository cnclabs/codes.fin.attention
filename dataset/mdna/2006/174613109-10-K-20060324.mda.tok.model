segment profit loss the company manages its operations in five business segments  home service life  broker life  preneed life  dental  and other health 
products in all five segments are sold through independent agency operations 
home service life consists primarily of traditional life insurance coverage sold in amounts of  and under to middle and lower income individuals 
this distribution channel is characterized by a significant amount of agent contact with customers throughout the year 
broker life product sales consist primarily of simplified issue and graded benefit policies in amounts of  and under 
other products in the broker life segment that comprise a significant portion of existing business include group life  universal life  annuities and participating life policies 
preneed life products are sold to individuals in connection with prearrangement of their funeral and include single and multi pay policies  generally in amounts of  and less 
these policies are generally sold to middle aged and elderly individuals 
dental products are term policies generally sold to small and intermediate size employer groups 
other health products include various accident and health policies sold to individuals and employer groups 
profit or loss for each segment is reported on a pretax basis  without an allocation of realized investment gains or interest expense 
the company s segment loss was  compared to losses of  in and  in the segment loss in  excluding nonrecurring items described below  was 
the nonrecurring items in include costs of  settlement and legal costs incurred in associated with the legal proceedings described in item  and additional one time consulting expenses of  related to redesign and other organizational restructuring begun in  as well as severance agreements 
the decrease of  in segment loss from  in to  in results primarily from a a decrease in premiums and other considerations of  preneed decreased  dental decreased  home service decreased  other health decreased  while broker life increased  including new final expense premiums of  b an increase in investment and other income of  c a decrease in policyholder benefits and commissions of  d a decrease in general expenses and depreciation of  and e a decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance acquired of  offset by a decrease in amortization of acquisition costs deferred of  see pages through of management s discussion and analysis for a more extensive analysis of factors impacting the individual segment operating results between years 
net income the company s net income is  compared to a net income of  and  in and  respectively 
these results reflect the segment losses described above including nonrecurring items and net realized gains of   and  in  and  respectively 
the company realized significant increases in realized capital gains in both and due to restructuring the investment portfolio to include a greater proportion of fixed maturity investments and fewer equity investments while taking advantage of an upturn in the equities market 
after the restructuring  our equities portfolio did not present opportunities for similar levels of realized gains in comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss which combine net income loss and net unrealized gains and losses were   and  for   and  respectively 
during  the company continued to be adversely affected by relatively low yields on its fixed income investment portfolio 
the increase of  in comprehensive loss in is attributable to the increase in net income of  described above offset by the change in unrealized losses of 
late in the second quarter of  interest yields on fixed maturity investments began to rise 
although this adversely impacts the market value of the company s bond portfolio  the opportunity to invest new money at higher yields has a positive impact on the company s operating earnings 
the environment continues to generate a relatively high level of qualitative investment risk  as discussed in the cash flow and liquidity section 
the majority of the declines in net income and the comprehensive losses were attributable to adverse securities markets  including the effects of declines in the airlines  telecommunications and technology sectors and general economic sluggishness 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the company repurchased  and  shares of its common stock during and respectively  at average prices of and per share  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to investments  agent receivables  intangible assets  policy liabilities  income taxes  regulatory requirements and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies  judgments and estimates  which have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors  critically impact preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
investment in debt and equity securities 
the company holds debt and equity interests in a variety of companies  many of which are seeking to exploit recent technology advancements 
the majority of these are publicly traded and many have experienced volatile market prices 
company management periodically evaluates whether the declines in fair value of investments are other than temporary 
these evaluations involve significant judgment 
the evaluations consist of a review of qualitative and quantitative factors  including analysis of the company s competitive position in its markets  deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and other publicly available issuer specific news or general market conditions 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be temporary and which the company has the ability and intent to hold until full recovery are included as an unrealized loss in shareholders equity 
declines in fair values of securities deemed to be other than temporary are included in net income as realized investment losses 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred acquisition costs dac 
the company is required to defer certain policy acquisition costs and amortize them over future periods 
these costs include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring new business 
the deferred costs are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
the dac asset balance is subsequently charged to income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated emergence of revenue or profits 
actual revenue or profits can vary from company estimates  resulting in an increase or decrease in the rate of amortization 
the company regularly evaluates its dac balances to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
assumptions considered significant include surrender and lapse rates  mortality  expense levels  investment performance  and estimated interest spread 
should actual experience dictate that the company change its assumptions regarding the emergence of future revenues or profits commonly referred to as unlocking  the company would record a charge or credit to bring its dac balance to the level it would have been if using the new assumptions from the inception date of each policy 
dac is also subject to periodic recoverability and loss recognition testing 
these tests ensure that the present value of future contract related cash flows will support the capitalized dac balance to be amortized in the future 
the present value of these cash flows  less the benefit reserve  is compared with the unamortized dac balance and if the dac balance is greater  the deficiency is charged to expense as a component of amortization and the asset balance is reduced to the recoverable amount 
for more information about accounting for dac see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible impairment 
the balance of the company s goodwill and value of insurance acquired vif was million at december  the recovery of these assets is dependent on the fair value of the business to which they relate 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests based on the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair value of these assets 
different valuation methods and assumptions can produce significantly different results that could affect the amount of any potential impairment charge that might be required to be recognized 
during both and  the company concluded that no impairment adjustment was necessary for its goodwill or vif 
policy liabilities 
establishing policy liabilities for the company s long duration insurance contracts requires making many assumptions  including policyholder persistency  mortality rates  investment yields  discretionary benefit increases  new business pricing  and operating expense levels 
the company evaluates historical experience for these factors when assessing the need for changing current assumptions 
however  since many of these factors are interdependent and subject to short term volatility during the long duration contract period  substantial estimates and judgment are required 
accordingly  if actual experience emerges differently from that assumed  any such difference would be recognized in the current year s consolidated statement of operations 
deferred income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the company has not assumed future taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
financial position assets

during  the company did not recognize any impairment losses on fixed maturities 
the company reviews its fixed maturity portfolio quarterly for impairment losses which might be other than temporary losses and recognizes all such losses in the quarter they are deemed other than temporary 
realized investment losses included  of pretax impairment losses for the year ended december  the impairments recorded were the result of the continued credit deterioration of specific issuers in the bond and equity markets  especially in the airline and telecommunications industries 

imggif 
shown below are the company s four largest holdings in non investment grade bonds by a single issuer as of december  the company had no guarantee or other type of enhancement associated with the issuers represented above

the company reviews its marketable investments each quarter to determine if there have been declines in their value that in management s opinion are other than temporary 
these reviews can involve qualitative and quantitative information relating to an individual company or industry and general factors impacting the economy 
however  due to wide market fluctuations occurring during the past two years  determining whether declines are temporary has become much more complex and judgmental 
these reviews resulted in the recognition of impairment losses on equity securities totaling  during   and  for the first  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
in addition   of impairment losses were recognized on fixed maturities during  all in the third quarter 
during  equity securities were sold which contained impairment write downs of  and no fixed maturities were sold which contained impairment write downs

market conditions for this property are generally favorable 
an updated appraisal obtained during indicates the market value of the property is approximately  higher than its carrying amounts 
at december  the company has recorded  of goodwill and  of deferred policy acquisition costs and value of insurance acquired 
as noted in the above discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates  these intangibles  and the recorded value of policy liabilities  are based on many assumptions that require substantial estimates and judgment 
at december  and december  the company reassessed the assumptions supporting these values in accordance with sfas no 
although no impairment was considered necessary  management will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the recorded values of these intangibles and will make adjustments to such values in the future as management deems necessary

broker life sales increased in from sales of the new final expense product 
only a modest change was experienced in preneed life premiums are lower  due in part to the company s decision to emphasize the lower annual premium multi pay policies rather than single pay policies and some loss of volume attributable to reducing commission levels and the rate of annual growth credited to policies 
the company is not currently focusing any marketing effort to this segment because of the adverse effects of the low interest rate environment of recent years

consolidated results and analysis 
imggif 
premiums and other considerations 
the following table details premiums and other considerations received during the past three years 
home service life premium decreased modestly in both and new sales began to decline in the fourth quarter of and have continued to decline in as a result of producer response to the company s introduction of a variable first year commission program designed to improve persistency in this segment 
the company also lost our regional representative for the florida and georgia region  as well as several producers in that region early in the company continues its efforts to attract successful  experienced home service agents 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began to geographically expand the home service market  hiring two new regional representatives to recruit new agents in ohio and pennsylvania 
company management considers it a challenge to increase new sales even modestly  while providing incentive to keep business in force for longer periods than we have historically experienced ie improve our persistency rate in this segment 
the increase in broker life premium during resulted primarily from the introduction of the new final expense product early in the year in an effort to strengthen the growth of this segment by better meeting the desires of our policyholders and agents 
the and decrease in preneed life premium during and  respectively  resulted from the company s modification of certain policy benefits and commissions which resulted in a loss in the number of producers and an intentional refocusing of marketing efforts toward segments that the company believes offer more positive potential in the current environment 
the decrease in dental premium during resulted primarily from the non renewal of a large group with an unsatisfactory claims loss ratio  and introducing more aggressive renewal underwriting 
the result  as expected  was a decrease in premium and a decrease in the overall claims loss ratio from in to in during recent years  new business production has become increasingly competitive as larger providers expand their marketing initiatives 
however  the company has historically maintained strong customer and agent loyalty by continuing to improve customer service  including sales and administrative support functions 
in january the company began expanding its capacity to administer more dental business without increasing administration costs by replacing our group administration system with a current state of the art system 
the new system was placed in service in january and the company plans to add additional functionality features throughout including a group website  preferred provider network  third party administration capability and auto adjudication of claims 
the company also employed a senior marketing executive and a regional sales representative to focus marketing efforts on the dental segment 
the company has not been actively marketing other health policies for several years 
however  in response to agent requests  certain cancer and disability protection products have been updated and promoted 
pricing  underwriting  and claims experience on these products are closely monitored 
due to unsatisfactory financial results in this product line  the company discontinued selling new disability policies in october  and received approval to increase premium rates by effective february  in the state of new jersey  where the majority of such policies have been issued 
investments 
the company monitors its available for sale fixed maturities and equity securities to assure they are strategically positioned within the current market environment 
this practice has historically resulted in holding significant equity security positions  which tend to dampen current income yields in favor of an overall total return focus 
the company s equity securities comprised and of its total investment portfolios at december  and  respectively 
the company s investment income yields were   and for   and  respectively 
the yield increase resulted primarily from increasing interest rates on new investments  as well as improved short term yields during the year 
although the company s total return on investments has historically been favorable  returns in recent years have been severely impacted by declines in the airline  automobile  telecommunications and technology sectors  declines in the fixed maturities market due to increasing rates  a general economic recession and the effect of terrorist events on the securities markets 
as detailed in the following table  net realized and unrealized investment gains losses totaled approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company does not anticipate severe deterioration in the securities markets as experienced during the years through although there is still some volatility in the equities markets 
at december  and  the company s investment portfolios contained net unrealized gains outstanding of  and  respectively

the company realized significant gains on the sales of equity securities and high yield  below investment grade bonds during and as we repositioned our portfolio to include a greater proportion of investment grade bonds

during  the company accepted a significant amount of single premium business  which generally has higher than average mortality rates 
at that time  significant management and marketing resources were devoted to this business 
to improve profitability  annual benefit growth rates were reduced in early and again in september also  twice during  certain commission rates were reduced and agent contracts revised to encourage production of the more profitable multi pay products 
dental information regarding dental profitability is included below 
the contribution margin shown below is a direct margin without allocable investment income and general expense 

imggif 
the contribution margin increased in by  due primarily to the company s aggressive renewal underwriting and re rating and not renewing a large group with a particularly high morbidity rate in december although premiums decreased  in  benefits decreased  and commissions decreased  expenses for the dental segment increased  due to the increased marketing resources allocated to this segment the company employed a senior marketing executive for this segment in august of  and employed a regional representative in the fourth quarter of 
the contribution margin decreased in by  from due to adverse morbidity especially related to one large group and inadequate premium for groups renewing 
also  the company has encountered more competition as additional insurers continue to expand in the dental market and dental providers continue to provide higher levels of care to patients 
the company is continuing its ongoing efforts to maintain profitability in this line by reconfiguring products to provide adequate margins for the various dental procedures  utilizing a third party company to provide expert assistance with ongoing adjudication of claims  and continuing its program of aggressive renewal underwriting and re rating 
other health the company has not devoted significant marketing effort toward its other health products in recent years 
however  during through  a significant increase in disability claims occurred  with a concentration in new jersey 
the company received approval for a rate increase on its disability products in new jersey effective in early  and discontinued accepting applications for this policy in new jersey in the fall of income taxes 
historically  the company has experienced a relatively low effective current income tax rate  due primarily to the small life insurance company deduction  along with operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards 
the effective expense benefit rate is approximately and in and  respectively 
the small life insurance company deduction allows the life insurance subsidiaries to reduce their taxable income by before computing their current provisions for regular or alternative minimum tax 
however  for purposes of computing deferred income tax liabilities under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company is precluded from assuming the small life insurance company deduction will be available in the future 
accordingly  by disallowing this deduction  sfas no 
significantly increases the deferred taxes on the life insurance subsidiaries temporary differences 
thus  when a significant increase or decrease occurs in the company s net temporary differences  the related deferred tax is computed using the federal tax rate  whereas tax may actually be paid on these net liabilities when realized at a rate potentially as low as the alternative minimum tax rate after application of the allowable small life insurance company deduction 
the company s gross deferred federal income tax liabilities and assets are more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the gross deferred tax assets are offset  to some extent  by valuation allowances related to the company and to the life insurance subsidiaries and then offset against existing deferred tax liabilities 
the company s valuation allowance is designed to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated ultimate realization value 
statutory insurance information 
for insurance regulatory and rating purposes  the insurance subsidiaries report on the basis of statutory accounting principles sap 
in recent years  various state insurance departments and the naic have expressed concern  essentially about the rate of return earned by holders of small face amount life policies  potentially including preneed policies 
although the company does not believe calculating a simple rate of return or premium pay back measure is meaningful for traditional life insurance products  certain state insurance regulators are considering actions that could alter the profitability of existing contracts or eliminate small face amount policies as a viable product offering 
during december  citizens financial strengthened the statutory capital position of citizens security by acquiring  of citizens security redeemable preferred stock 
during january  citizens financial contributed of the capital stock of citizens insurance to citizens security 
the statutory value of this contribution was  citizens security has reported its investments in united liberty and citizens insurance on the equity method of accounting  since their acquisitions in and  respectively 
however  beginning in  new rules changed the statutory equity method of accounting to preclude a parent insurer from recording as income  its share of undistributed subsidiary earnings

at december   citizens security reported its investments in united liberty and citizens insurance at their statutory equity values of  and  respectively 
to provide a more detailed understanding of citizens security s operations  shown below are sap basis net income loss  pretax net operating income loss  statutory capital and surplus  asset valuation reserves  and capital ratios for citizens security for the five years ended december  
imggif 
asset valuation reserves are statutory liabilities that act as contingency reserves in the event of extraordinary losses on invested assets and as a buffer for policyholders surplus to reduce the impact of realized and unrealized investment losses 
the through amounts also include united liberty s asset valuation reserves 
citizens insurance does not have an asset valuation reserve 
represents statutory capital and surplus plus asset valuation reserves divided by invested assets plus cash 
the following table shows the changes to citizens security s statutory capital and surplus for the five years ended december  
imggif 
in addition to the statutory totals shown above  citizens insurance generated statutory net income of approximately   and  during    and  respectively without remitting any dividends to its parent 
citizens insurance generated statutory net income of  and  and paid dividends of  and  to citizens security in and  respectively 
united liberty generated statutory net income loss of approximately     and  during    and  respectively and remitted dividends to its parent of  and  in and  respectively 
statutory capital and surplus  specifically the component called surplus  is used to fund the expansion of an insurance company s first year individual life and accident and health sales 
the first year commission and underwriting expenses on such sales will often exceed first year premiums 
accordingly  a statutory loss surplus strain often occurs on these sales during the first policy year 
historically  the company s level of life insurance sales has not significantly impacted statutory surplus 
the company completed a strategic review of its products and operations  resulting in the mitigation of the significant losses incurred in the preneed life business segment in prior years and strengthening the potential for future profitability in the broker life  home service life and dental segments by increasing premiums  strengthening underwriting policies  modifying commissions  and where possible  lowering interest crediting or policy growth rates 
cash flow and liquidity due to losses in and and the adverse impact of the low interest rate environment on operating results  during the company borrowed  from its chairman to strengthen the statutory capital position of citizens security 
the company borrowed an additional  from its chairman in and an additional  in for general operating capital  including bank debt service 
the borrowings from the company s chairman are considered current debt as a result of a day call provision in the loan agreement 
the company also has  of commercial bank debt outstanding  with scheduled repayments due through april during  and the company did not comply with a loan covenant debt to earnings ratio on this debt and received a series of waivers of such violation through december  in return for the waivers the company s chairman agreed to personally guarantee the outstanding bank debt 
the company was in compliance with the debt covenant for the last two quarters of regarding the currently scheduled debt repayments  the company believes its available funds will be adequate to service debt obligations 
in addition  the company s chairman has expressed potential willingness to loan the company an additional  if necessary  which could service debt obligations through additional information regarding debt obligations is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a summary of all known commitments of the company as of december   including the aforementioned borrowings  and an estimate based on reasonable assumptions and anticipated trends of payments to be made for future policy benefits and contract claims  is as follows 
imggif 
a anticipated cash benefit payments not including any future earnings or additional premium management is not aware of any other commitments or unusual events that could materially affect the company s capital resources 
the company generated approximately   and  of cash flow from operations during  and  respectively 
the fluctuations are principally attributable to growth of preneed life premiums in and a decrease in preneed life premiums in and cash provided by used in investment activities of   and  during   and respectively  relates primarily to investing additional preneed life premiums in fixed maturity securities in and the net cash provided by investments in results primarily from the sale of short term investments for  less approximately  used to acquire new equipment 
cash used in financing activities during of  includes  of debt repayments and  of net withdrawals of policyholder deposits  offset by additional borrowings of  from the company s chairman 
the  of cash used by financing activities during includes  of debt repayments and  of net withdrawals of policyholder deposits  and  used to repurchase the company s common stock 
the company is subject to various market risks 
however  the most significant such risks relate to fluctuations in prices of equity securities and interest rates 
historically  total returns on the company s equity portfolio have been favorable and the company has successfully managed the risk of equity security price fluctuations over many years 
the company devotes significant attention to the equity markets and repositions the company s portfolio upon detection of adverse risk trends associated with individual securities or overall markets 
the company also manages market risks associated with investments in option securities  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the company s equity portfolio was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
accordingly  a decline in equity prices would have reduced the fair value of the company s equity portfolio by  and  at december  and  respectively 
the average cost value of the company s equity portfolio was  and  during and  respectively 
regarding interest rate risk  the value of the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio will increase or decrease in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates while net investment income earned on newly acquired fixed maturities increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
management estimates that a basis point increase in interest rates rate shock would have decreased the fair value of its million fixed maturity portfolio by approximately or million at december  and or million at december  from an income perspective  the company does not believe rising interest rates present a significant risk  as essentially all of the company s policy liabilities bear fixed rates 
however  approximately of policy liabilities contain provisions permitting interest or benefit adjustments at the discretion of the boards of directors of the insurance subsidiaries 
the company s cash flow testing described below indicates that overall profitability will generally be enhanced in rising interest rate scenarios 
from a liquidity perspective  the company s fixed rate policy liabilities have been relatively insensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  the company believes gradual increases in interest rates do not present a significant liquidity exposure 
the company monitors economic conditions on a regular basis and manages this interest rate risk primarily by adjusting the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio 
historically  the company has maintained conservative durations in its fixed maturity portfolio 
during and  the company increased durations of the fixed maturity portfolio 
at december  cash and fixed maturity investments with maturities of less than five years equaled approximately of total policy liabilities compared to approximately at december  notwithstanding the foregoing  if interest rates rise significantly in a short timeframe  there can be no assurance that the life insurance industry  including the company  would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales  and thereby be materially adversely affected 
interest expense on the company s debt varies quarterly and is therefore also subject to interest rate risk 
for its commercial bank debt  the company elects the lower of the prime lending rate or the one month libor rate plus 
for its related party debt  the interest rate is the higher of or the commercial bank prime lending rate plus 
at december   the weighted average rate on the company s  of borrowings was 
the company believes its current liquidity position and profitability levels are adequate to guard against this interest rate risk 
in addition to the measures described above  the life insurance subsidiaries comply with the naic promulgated standard valuation law svl which specifies minimum reserve levels and prescribes methods for determining them  with the intent of enhancing solvency 
the svl also requires the company to perform annual cash flow testing for its life insurance subsidiaries 
this testing is designed to ensure that statutory reserve levels will maintain adequate protection in a variety of potential interest rate scenarios 
the actuarial standards board of the american academy of actuaries also requires cash flow testing as a basis for the actuarial opinion on the adequacy of the reserves which is a required part of the annual statutory reporting process 
cash flow testing projects cash inflows from assets and cash outflows for liabilities in various assumed economic and yield curve scenarios 
this is a dynamic process  whereby the performance of the assets and liabilities is directly related to the scenario assumptions 
an example would involve the credited interest rate on annuity products and how such rates vary depending upon projected earnings rates  which are based upon asset performance under a particular economic scenario 
the life insurance subsidiaries most recent cash flow testing  which was completed in february  involved a review of two basic measures 
the first was the value of free market surplus  which is defined as the difference between the projected market value of assets and liabilities at the end of the analysis period typically years 
deficits could indicate the need for corrective action depending upon the severity and the number of scenarios in which a deficit appeared 
a second measure involved distributable earnings 
negative earnings for extended durations might impair the ability of the life insurance subsidiaries to continue without exhausting surplus 
again  depending upon severity and frequency  corrective measures might be needed 
based on results of the testing  no corrective measures were indicated at the current time 
however  such testing is ongoing and dynamic in nature and future events in the interest and equity markets or a significant change in the composition of life insurance subsidiaries business could negatively impact testing results and require the initiation of corrective measures 
any necessary corrective measures could take one or more forms 
the duration of existing assets might not match well with those of the liabilities 
certain liabilities  such as those associated with indemnity accident and health  short term disability and group dental products  are short term in nature and are best matched with cash and short term investments 
by contrast  whole life insurance  which involves lifetime obligations  is usually best matched by longer duration maturities 
in the event there are insufficient assets of these types  a repositioning of the investment portfolio might be undertaken 
initially balanced durations do not guarantee positive future results 
asset type  quality  and yield will vary depending upon the economic scenario tested 
liabilities will be similarly affected 
projected reinvestment yields may cause overall yields to fall below those required to support projected liabilities 
in that event  portfolio realignment might involve the type  quality and yield of investments rather than duration 
alternatively  additional reserve amounts could be allocated to cover any future shortfalls 
the above discussion centers on asset management 
other possible corrective measures might involve liability realignment 
the company s marketing plan could be modified to emphasize certain product types and reduce others 
new business levels could be varied in order to find the optimum level 
management believes that the company s current liquidity  current bond portfolio maturity distribution and cash flow from operations give it substantial resources to administer its existing business and fund growth generated by direct sales
