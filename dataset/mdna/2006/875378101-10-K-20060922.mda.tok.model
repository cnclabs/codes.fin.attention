the table below presents sales and gross margin data for our reportable segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 

table of contents increase increase decrease decrease net sales men s accessories women s accessories gross margin men s accessories women s accessories gross margin percent of sales men s accessories women s accessories total our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product mix between mass merchant retailers which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expense sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others

table of contents the following table presents our segments selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses  and our interest expense in thousands of dollars 
increase increase decrease decrease selling  general and administrative expense men s accessories women s accessories depreciation and amortization men s accessories women s accessories interest expense challenges and opportunities fiscal was a difficult year as we took several important steps to improve our financial performance 
as the year progressed  we took a hard look at how to improve overall efficiency and profitability  particularly in our women s accessories segment 
it was important for us to respond as the retail environment continued to change with increased competition  higher energy costs  and department store consolidations 
during the quarter ended march  we evaluated the level of contribution from each of our women s product lines in order to improve operating performance 
as a result we made the decision to exit from several women s categories that were no longer profitable 
based on the findings of the study the women s segment will focus on our core competencies of women s and children s belts  small leather goods  handbags  and gift accessories  all other product categories in the women s segment  including socks  cold weather accessories  fashion scarves  evening bags  and children s accessories excluding belts  have been discontinued  except for fulfilling existing orders and programs  a million provision was recorded in the third quarter ended march  to write down inventory and packaging to our best estimate of the market value that we expect will be realized  and thirty three positions in our women s dallas distribution facility were eliminated in the discontinued product areas resulting in one time payroll costs of approximately  in the third quarter 
as part of our restructuring efforts we continue to evaluate and modify our management team in order to improve results 
we have placed experienced  capable leaders in key roles within our executive  design  and operations management 
compared to net sales and gross margins the fiscal net sales of our men s and women s accessories segments increased and  respectively  over fiscal s level resulting in million of consolidated sales  or  more than fiscal for the men s accessories segment  fiscal sales  exclusive of gift accessories  were slightly less than the prior year as belt sales  which had increased significantly in the prior two years  were more in line with those of fiscal most of the belt sales decline was offset by increased sales of small leather goods and other products  including men s neckwear 
some of the expected growth in men s accessories did not materialize because of a major customer s decision to reduce its company wide inventories 
the eton gift accessories business sales increased by million in fiscal sales were dampened for our women s accessories segment by competitive market pressures and weakened fashion accessory trends 
while belt sales were up  or million  the gain was partly offset by the decline in sales of other products 
overall the women s accessories segment sales gain for the year was derived from products which have been discontinued as we focus on products having higher profit margins 

table of contents our overall gross margin for fiscal was of net sales compared to in approximately percentage points of this decline were attributable to the impact of the women s segment provision for discontinued product line inventory and approximately percentage points of the decline were attributable to product mix 
the men s accessories segment gross margin was off percentage points as the result of more direct shipments of small leather goods which typically have lower margins as well as a million inventory mark down provision in the fourth quarter 
the women s segment gross margin  excluding the effect of the discontinued inventory provision  was percentage points lower from the effects of mass merchant sales at lower than normal margins in order to reduce excess inventory 
direct shipments have lower gross margins because these goods are shipped from our suppliers to our customers and are not handled in our distribution centers  thereby reducing the general and administrative costs related to the sales 
any material changes in sales mix  such as higher mass merchant accessory sales or direct shipments  could lower our gross margin percentages during a particular season 
operating expenses fiscal sg a expenses were million compared to million in the current year s expenses were increased by share based compensation of  due to our adoption of sfas no 
r on july  and payroll and inventory relocation expenses of  related to the restructuring of our women s segment 
the overall lower sg a expenses were derived from reduced costs in our women s segment due to consolidation of its mass merchant and department store businesses  as well as reductions in legal  advertising  and travel  expenses 
sg a expenses for our men s segment increased  as increases in distribution costs  including a greater percentage of shared distribution center expenses  product development  and royalties  offset reductions in payroll  advertising  and other costs 
based on the company s financial performance  our board of directors determined that i the salaries for fiscal for our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and vice president of operations would remain at the levels established for fiscal  ii equity compensation awards would not be granted to such officers and no bonuses will be paid to our executive officers for fiscal  and iii the non employee directors would not be granted equity awards 
depreciation expense in our men s accessories segment increased primarily as a result of property and equipment additions at our yoakum  texas facility see the following liquidity and capital resources discussion while the women s accessories segment depreciation declined because of asset retirements 
the  goodwill impairment charge in fiscal was the result of assessing the fair value of our women s accessories segment because of changing business conditions for women s mass market merchant sales 
interest expense in fiscal was  more than fiscal s expense primarily due to our credit facility s increasing interest rates  which ranged from to in fiscal compared to the range of to in fiscal  and additional loan fees in connection with the amendments to our credit facility described in the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
the primary differences between the federal statutory tax rate and the benefit from the fiscal pretax loss are for the goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for income tax purposes and for state income taxes based on subsidiaries earnings that are not offset by the provision for discontinued product line inventory 
the impaired goodwill arose from the stock purchase of accessory design group in april summary in fiscal the benefits of increased sales and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses were offset by the million per share charge related to our women s segment discontinued product lines  associated packaging costs  and severance payments  and the  per share goodwill impairment 
the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal 
table of contents compared to net sales and gross margins net sales in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal the overall increase was primarily due to the sale of gift accessories by our eton division  acquired on july  net sales of men s accessories increased million compared to the prior year due to the addition of gift accessories from eton  which added million in net sales  as well as increased sales of men s belts and small leather goods 
strengthening sales of neckwear and jewelry  added to our men s product line in late  also increased sales in fiscal net sales of women s accessories decreased million due to reduced sales by both our mass merchant and department store businesses across all major product categories during fiscal the shortfall was due to downward pressures on women s accessories replenishment  competitive market pressures at the department store level for handbags and small leather goods as well as changing trends in fashion accessories categories  such as straw bags  compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal eton recorded sales of million  net of million of discounts  returns and allowances 
included in that amount is a  reserve for sales returns at june  due to the nature of eton s business  a significant percentage of sales in gift accessories occur during the holiday season 
a reserve was recorded during that quarter for anticipated returns expected to occur during the following quarter 
gross margins as a percentage of sales increased  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a higher sales mix of men s accessories  which includes the higher margin gift accessories business 
gross margins in our men s division increased million compared to the prior year 
this increase offset the million decrease in gross margins for women s accessories which was due to higher than anticipated customer allowances requested by customers to offset their markdowns at retail in order to increase product sales 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to million of selling  general and administrative costs resulting from our acquisition of eton which include the planned integration costs related to the operation of an additional facility in new orleans  such as rent  wages  and other operating costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal most of the expenses related to the new orleans operations were phased out  with inventory and shipping operations relocated to our west bend  wisconsin facility 
commission expense increased by  due to the sales increase related to our acquisition of eton 
total royalty expense for the year increased to million compared to million in fiscal due to payments for eton royalties as well as increased royalty expense in our other divisions

other variable costs also increased due to the million sales increase over the prior year 
also  during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded a bad debt recovery of  and  respectively  from a customer s bankruptcy court settlement and payment of accounts receivable that we had previously reserved 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge for goodwill impairment related to our women s department store division in the amount of  the goodwill impairment was recorded due to the decreased sales in our women s department store division resulting from soft holiday sales and competitive market pressures at the department store level for handbags and small leather goods during fiscal this downturn in business and a reduction in expected future cash flows from our women s department store division resulted in an impairment of the goodwill related to this business 
depreciation and amortization expense increased due to our acquisition of eton  additional leasehold improvements in our corporate office  and assets related to the distribution software implementation in yoakum  texas 
included in the expense for eton is amortization of  related to million of intangibles  primarily customer lists  acquired with eton 
interest expense for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the expiration of our rate swap agreement on june  our weighted average interest rate for fiscal was and for fiscal  including the rate swap 

table of contents the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was lower for due to lower effective state and local tax rates 
summary net income for fiscal decreased to million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the decrease in net income in fiscal was due to reduced sales of women s mass merchant accessories  the  goodwill impairment charge related to our women s department store business  and increased operating costs described above 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal and million in accounts receivable were reduced million from the prior year s level while inventory manufactured and purchased was about equal to our shipments 
an increase in other current assets used million of our cash flow 
included in other current assets is million of refundable income taxes million was received in august and the balance is expected in june and a million short term cash investment maturing shortly after the end of the fiscal year 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were reduced a total of million this year due to the timing of inventory purchases for fall and the holiday season 
in fiscal the  change in the amount of cash overdrafts is classified as a financing activity 
the income tax benefits from restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises exceeding the tax benefits of recognized share based compensation expense are included in our statement of cash flows as a financing activity for  and operating activities for and  and  respectively as the result of adopting sfas no 
r on july  fiscal capital expenditures for property and equipment totaling almost million were primarily for computer equipment and software  including the implementation of an additional software module for our enterprise software and additions to the distribution system in our yoakum  texas facility 
we also expended  for additional warehouse racking and forklifts needed to reconfigure our distribution facilities as part of the restructuring of our product lines 
in fiscal the million spent on property and equipment additions was for new distribution software and related computer hardware in yoakum 
other capital expenditures that year were related to leasehold improvements in our corporate offices 
fiscal investing activities also included the million purchase of superior merchandise company described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility which we believe will provide adequate financial resources for our future working capital needs 
information about the credit facility is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the maximum amount borrowed under the credit facility in fiscal was million in november we were able to pay down our long term debt by million in fiscal primarily as the result of collecting a greater amount of our accounts receivable 
we also paid  in dividends in fiscal more than half of the debt reduction and dividend payment cash outflows was offset by common stock sold to employees through our stock purchase program and the exercise of stock options 
during the quarter ended september  we were in violation of the funded indebtedness to ebitda ratio and ebitda to fixed charge ratio covenants of our credit facility 
shipping delays throughout the supply chain related to hurricane katrina as well as an increase in sales of lower margin direct sales goods and nonrecurring legal and restructuring expenses incurred during the prior twelve months resulted in an ebitda shortfall  thereby causing us to breach such covenants in our credit facility 
we believe that had the shipping delays not occurred in the first quarter  we would have been in compliance with the covenants under our credit facility 
our lenders agreed to an amendment to the credit facility to adjust certain financial covenant requirements 
this fourth amendment to our credit facility  entered into on october  and effective as of september   among other things established applicable commitment fee percentages and applicable margins for libor based borrowings at higher ratios of funded indebtedness to ebitda 

table of contents as a consequence of the million charge in connection with restructuring of our women s segment  we were in violation of certain covenants of the credit facility at march  our lenders agreed to amend our credit facility to adjust certain financial covenant requirements 
the fifth amendment  entered into on april  and effective as of march   among other things i increased the applicable margins for libor based borrowings  ii amended the definition of ebitda to exclude a up to million in noncash goodwill or intangibles impairment charges during any four quarters and b a one time charge of up to million attributable to women s segment inventory write off  severance pay and related benefits  and men s and women s packaging inventory write offs related to relocation of product lines  iii amended the definition of fixed charges to a include all payments related to the redemption  retirement  acquisition  or prepayment of capital stock or other equity interest  and b exclude revolving credit loan implied principal payments  and iv lowered permitted acquisitions to million 
based on internal projections we anticipate compliance with all covenants related to the credit facility for the next twelve months 
effective september  our credit facility was amended and restated extending its expiration to june  the amendments reduce our maximum borrowing from million to million and the libor interest margins have been reduced to a range of to based on various debt to equity ratios from the prior range of to 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical  and a basic sensitivity analysis as to how each relate to our financial statements  are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances we recognize revenue when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including extra cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our allowances in thousands except per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effects of these estimates 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns change in accounts receivable reserve inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor the accumulation of excess inventory at the end of each season 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values above cost 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown would be estimated and charged to expense in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
we closely monitor fashion trend items and anticipate additional inventory markdowns if market indications in fashion trends justify further reserves 
historically such inventory markdowns have generally been within our expectations 
sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our june  inventory would be in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory markdown 
table of contents goodwill goodwill impairment is measured at least annually by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill to the unit s carrying value 
goodwill is allocated to our reporting units which are groups within each of our business segments which focus on the design  procurement  or marketing of related products 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value  the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is computed by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets other than goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to the assets other than the goodwill is considered the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the goodwill s implied fair value is compared to its carrying value and any shortfall represents the impairment amount 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the future cash flows expected to be derived from our goodwill 
such evaluations are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  and other factors 
a significant change in future cash flows or the cost of capital could result in a goodwill impairment 
share based compensation when adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r effective july   we selected the modified prospective method instead of restating prior years balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows as required by the modified retrospective method based on amounts previously recognized in the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
our estimated fair values would be greater if the expected dividend yield was decreased and the other assumptions were increased 
the resulting output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may not be the value that ultimately may be realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits the company may realize 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the information in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report is incorporated herein by reference 
inflation although our operations are affected by general economic trends  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operating results during the past three fiscal years 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt 
the effect of a one percent increase or decrease in the interest rate on the amount of our long term debt outstanding at of june  could lower or increase our annual pre tax operating results by  we do not expect the potential impact of market conditions on the fair value of our indebtedness to be material 
in addition to interest rate risk on our long term debt  we also are exposed to market risk with respect to changes in the global price level of certain commodities used in the production of our products 
we routinely purchase leather hides during the year for use in the manufacture of belts 
we also purchase a substantial amount of leather items from third party suppliers 
an unanticipated material increase in the market price of leather could increase the cost of these products to us and  therefore  have a negative effect on our operating results 
market risk related to foreign currency historically has not been material since generally we have negotiated and settled agreements for the materials we purchase for the production of our products in us dollars
