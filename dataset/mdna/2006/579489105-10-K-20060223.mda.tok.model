item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company owns and publishes newspapers in the united states 
the company s newspapers range from large dailies serving metropolitan areas to non daily newspapers serving small communities 
the company supplements its newspaper publishing with an array of niche products and direct marketing initiatives  including direct mail 
the company also operates leading local websites in each of its daily newspaper markets offering users information  comprehensive news  advertising  e commerce and other services 
the company also owns and operates mcclatchy interactive  an interactive media operation that provides newspapers with content  publishing tools and software development 
the company s primary source of revenue is advertising  which  in any given year  accounts for roughly of the company s revenue 
while percentages vary from year to year  and from newspaper to newspaper  retail advertising carried as a part of newspapers run of press or rop advertising or in advertising inserts placed in newspapers preprint advertising  generally contributes roughly of advertising revenues at the company s newspapers 
recent trends have been for certain national or regional retailers to use greater preprint advertising and less rop advertising  although that trend shifts from time to time 
nonetheless  rop advertising still makes up the majority of retail advertising 
classified advertising including online classified advertising  primarily in automotive  employment and real estate categories  generally contributes about of advertising revenue and national advertising generally contributes about of total advertising 
direct marketing and other advertising make up the remainder of the company s advertising revenues 
circulation revenues contribute roughly of the company s newspaper revenues  depending upon the size and locale of the newspaper 
most newspapers are delivered by independent contractors 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
see the following results of operations for a discussion of the company s revenue performance and contribution by categories for fiscal  and critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible accounts  amortization and or impairment of intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and the company s income tax provision 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition advertising revenues are recorded when advertisements are placed in the newspaper and circulation revenues are recorded as newspapers are delivered over the subscription term 
circulation revenues are recorded net of direct delivery costs 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
revenues are recorded net of estimated incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance account for estimated losses resulting from the risk its customers will not make required payments 
generally  the company uses the aging of accounts receivable  reserving for all accounts due days or longer  to establish allowances for losses on accounts receivable 
however  if the company becomes aware that the financial condition of a customer has deteriorated  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances are reserved 
to illustrate the impact of a change to the allowance for uncollectible accounts  hypothetically  if the amount of receivables that are days or longer had increased by  the company s allowance for estimated losses would have increased by  at the end of fiscal goodwill and intangible impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangibles  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the company periodically analyzes its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment 
no impairment change was recorded in fiscal  or pension and post retirement benefits the company has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including salary rate increases  discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in the company s employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
the company used a discount rate of  assumed salary rate increases of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate its retirement expenses in fiscal  based upon consultation with its outside actuaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more in depth discussion of the company s policies in setting its key assumptions related to these obligations 
for fiscal  a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on our net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
the company has revised certain assumptions for its pension expense calculation 
please see recent events and trends operating expenses discussion below 
income tax provision the company s current and deferred tax income provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if needed  throughout the year 
adjustments between the company s estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by federal and state authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
the company s estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is significantly affected by management judgments 
management believes that the company has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters based upon currently available information 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities when the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  earnings or deductions estimated to be in each jurisdiction by the company may differ from actual amounts 
as a result of these potential adjustments  the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation in california and alaska 
the company relies on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate provision for self insurance claims 
the company used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate or a increase in claims would have had an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
recent events and trends stock repurchase program on september  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s class a common stock 
the shares will be repurchased at the company s discretion  either in the open market or in privately negotiated block transactions 
the decision to buy back stock will depend on prevailing market prices  availability  and market conditions  among other things 
any purchases will occur from time to time and the company has not set any time frame for completion of the program 
it is anticipated that the repurchases will largely be funded using the company s excess cash flows  and commercial paper program  as needed 
no repurchases were made in fiscal recent litigation a lawsuit filed against the company on june  by four local employment agencies in minneapolis alleged  in us district court of minnesota  misstatements in the audit bureau of circulations abc reported circulation volumes by the star tribune newspaper from through the present 
on november  abc released the results of its audit  confirming that no adjustments were required by the star tribune for any numbers previously reported to abc 
the company entered into a settlement at the request of the plaintiffs which included reimbursement of certain of the plaintiff s legal fees for  and future advertising credits to the plaintiffs of up to  and the withdrawal of the plaintiffs from the suit 
the suit was dismissed on january  the company expended approximately million legal costs and other expenses million in the third quarter of to investigate the allegations and to defend against the suit 
advertising revenues classified revenues are the most cyclical of the company s advertising revenues  and in contributed of the company s total advertising revenue growth 
over the last several years the individual categories within classified advertising have shown significant variability 
a boom in automotive advertising from through caused the company s automotive advertising to grow  from million in to million in in  automotive sales faltered  and automotive advertising at the dealership level dropped  causing the company s auto classified advertising revenues to decline to million in fiscal the decline in automotive advertising has been more than offset by an escalation in real estate advertising  and a continued rebound in employment advertising from depressed levels earlier in the decade  resulting in total classified advertising growth of in fiscal over fiscal within classified advertising  online advertising is playing an increasingly important role at the company s newspapers 
in  online classified advertising grew or million 
while online classified advertising makes up of total classified advertising revenue  it contributed of the growth 
the company continues to pursue a strategy that offers a combination of print only  print and online and online only products in classified advertising  and believes that combined with its longstanding relationships with customers and value added services  these products offer advantages that most competitors for classified advertising cannot match 

table of contents operating expenses the company incurred two newsprint price increases in and three in  resulting in an average increase of in newsprint prices in fiscal compared to fiscal an additional price increase has been announced for the first quarter of  however  the ultimate amount and or timing of any price increase is uncertain at this time 
newsprint pricing is largely dependent on global demand and supply for newsprint 
a hypothetical per metric ton change in newsprint prices affects earnings per share by three cents annually 
the impact of newsprint price increases on the company s expenses is discussed under results of operations below 
the company s fringe benefit costs increased over fiscal due primarily to higher retirement and medical costs 
with regard to the company s retirement expenses  the company used a discount rate to calculate its pension and post retirement expenses in fiscal compared to a rate used in fiscal the company contributed million to its pension plans in early fiscal  and earnings on this contribution partially offset these increases 
nonetheless  total retirement expenses increased million in fiscal in  for purposes of calculating retirement expenses  the company has reduced its discount rate to  which will result in higher pension expenses 
the company voluntarily contributed million to its pension plans in early fiscal and earnings on the contribution are expected to help offset the impact of a lower discount rate 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the modified prospective application requires that compensation expense be recorded at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r for all unvested stock options and restricted stock based upon the previously disclosed sfas methodology and amounts 
the company has adopted sfas r effective december   first day of the fiscal year  using the modified prospective application  and expects stock option expense to reduce earnings in fiscal by approximately cents per share 
on july   fasb issued a proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fasb no 
the release of the final interpretation is now scheduled for the first quarter of the proposed effective date is for the first fiscal year beginning after december  the proposed interpretation would require that a tax position meet a more likely than not threshold for the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements  and assumes the uncertain tax position will be examined by taxing authorities 
the proposed interpretation could also affect the classification of deferred tax liabilities versus income taxes payable  the classification of long term liabilities and the accounting for a change in tax reserves in interim period reporting 
the company is evaluating the impact of adopting this proposed interpretation on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas no 
generally requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required when a new pronouncement does not specifically include transition provisions 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements
