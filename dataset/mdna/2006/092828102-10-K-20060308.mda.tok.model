in addition  the company focused on reducing inventory liquidation costs in the combination of enhanced internet clearance activity and improved merchandise purchasing strategies resulted in less liquidation inventory on hand and greater recovery rates as a percent of cost for the inventory that required liquidation 
due to the nonrecurring nature of the crossing pointe and allegheny trail write downs and improved recovery rates on liquidated merchandise  the obsolescence reserve at december   is appropriately lower than the reserve at december   on comparable inventory levels

a monthly provision for obsolete inventory is added to the reserve and expensed to cost of goods sold  based on the levels of merchandise inventory and merchandise purchases

accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than january  the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r on january  as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments  including stock options  granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r in  the company will recognize expenses of approximately  related to the unvested stock options at december  sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in  and  respectively 
future considerations the company is faced with the ever present challenge of maintaining and expanding its customer file 
this involves the acquisition of new customers prospects  the conversion of new customers to established customers active repeat buyers and the retention and or reactivation of established customers 
these actions are vital in growing the business but are being negatively impacted by increased operating costs  increased competition in the retail sector  high levels of consumer debt  varying consumer response rates and an uncertain economy 
the preceding factors can also negatively impact the company s ability to properly value inventories by making it more difficult to establish proper reserve and allowance levels  specifically  the allowances for returns and the reserve for inventory obsolescence 
the company s marketing strategy includes targeting customers in the to  low to moderate income market

we will review our internal control procedures and consider further documentation of such procedures that may be necessary in the future on an ongoing basis 
while we currently believe we have identified and committed the
