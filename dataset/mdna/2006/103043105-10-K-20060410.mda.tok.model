critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting polices are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the recognition of revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  restructuring costs  actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans  and contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions it uses in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome  and therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company has identified its critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that the company believes are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  business combinations  the company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as customer relationships  are amortized to expense over time  while purchase price allocated to in process research and development  if any  is recorded as a charge at the acquisition date if it is determined that it has no alternative future use 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of identifiable intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
the company has acquired certain identifiable intangible assets in connection with its acquisitions of decisionquest in  and tri coastal in these identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value associated with customer relationships  trade name  and covenants not to compete 
the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets is subjective and requires a great deal of expertise and judgment 
for these reasons  the company has used independent third party valuation firms to value these assets 
the values of the customer relationships were primarily derived using estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the customer relationships 
this approach was used since the inherent value of the customer relationship is its ability to generate current and future income 
the value of the trade name was determined using an estimated market based royalty rate applied to projected future revenue 
the value of the covenant not to compete was determined using a 
table of contents discounted cash flow methodology 
while different amounts would have been reported using different methods or using different assumptions  the company believes that the methods selected and the assumptions used are the most appropriate for each asset analyzed 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based upon the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units 
at december   our goodwill balance was  in testing for potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires the company to allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
the fair value of the company s reporting units was estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
additionally  an assumed terminal growth rate was used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal growth rates and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based upon historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
these assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business 
a decline in expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value could cause reporting units to be valued differently 
if the reporting units do not meet projected operating results  then this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  depending on the estimated value of the company s reporting units 
additionally  an increase in the assumed discount rate could also result in goodwill impairment 
based upon our analysis  the company concluded that there was an impairment of goodwill related to the document scanning and coding business and originally recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter ended september  based upon the unit operating losses during the year to date period 
this is a business that the company retained after it sold its document outsourcing business in the business was sold in january and the net assets of the business were further written down an additional million in the fourth quarter ended december  to reflect the fair value as determined in the asset purchase agreement 
the results of operations from this business are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue related to its financial print segment and marketing and business communications segment when services are completed or when the printed documents are shipped to customers 
revenue for completed but unbilled projects is recognized based on the company s historical standard pricing for type of service and is adjusted to actual when billed 
the company recognizes revenue from services provided in its litigation solutions services segment as the services are performed for time and material projects or when projects are completed for fixed fee arrangements 
software subscription revenue from the litigation solutions segment is paid in advance and recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the life of the contract  generally one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company realizes that it will be unable to collect all amounts that it bills to its customers 
therefore  it estimates the amount of billed receivables that it will be unable to collect and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts during each accounting period 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables 
the company s estimates are based on  among other things  the aging of its account receivables  its past experience collecting receivables  information about the ability of individual customers to pay  and current economic conditions 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall 
table of contents trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of  accounting for income taxes accounting for taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based upon the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that  and  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  which are related to certain foreign net operating losses and foreign capital losses which may not be utilized in future years 
the company evaluates quarterly the realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the primary factor used to assess the likelihood of realization is the company s forecast of future taxable income 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
accounting for pensions the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that expenses and liabilities recognized in financial statements be actuarially calculated 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the future performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plan 
the primary assumptions used in calculating pension expense and liability are related to the discount rate at which the future obligations are discounted to value the liability  expected rate of return on plan assets  and projected salary increases 
these rates are estimated annually as of december the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the percent at december  was used to calculate the pension expense 
each percentage point change in the discount rate would result in an million change in the projected pension benefit obligation and a million change in pension expense 

table of contents the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
from to  the company had been using an expected return on plan assets assumption of  which was consistent with the long term asset returns of the portfolio 
in  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to  and during lowered it again to due to the expected lower future performance of the us equity markets 
for and it has remained at 
each percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would result in a million change in pension expense 
the projected salary increase assumption is based upon historical trends and comparisons of the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
management has used the rate of for the past three years 
restructuring accrual during fiscal years   and  the company recorded significant restructuring charges 
prior to the fourth quarter of  these costs were accrued in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under eitf  the liability was recognized at the commitment date to an exit plan 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the terms of fasb statement no 
and requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate its fair value 
the company adopted fin in the fourth quarter of the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb opinion no 
and the intrinsic method of accounting  and requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in april  the sec adopted a new rule deferring the effective date of sfas r for public companies until the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year that begins after june  in accordance with the new rule  the company will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of and will recognize compensation expense for all share based payments and employee stock options based on the grant date fair value of those awards using the modified prospective method 
the company is completing its evaluation of the impact of the statement on its financial statements 
as the company currently accounts for share based payments using the intrinsic value method as allowed by apb opinion no 
 the adoption of the fair value method under sfas r will have an impact on its results of operations 
however  the extent of the impact cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally associated with trends in the domestic and international capital markets  particularly in the financial print segment 
this includes trends in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets  both important components of the financial print segment 
the company also has market risk tied to interest rate fluctuations related to its debt obligations and fluctuations in foreign currency  as discussed below 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investment portfolio  long term debt obligations  revolving credit agreement and synthetic lease agreement 
the company does not use derivative instruments in its short term investment portfolio 
the company s debentures issued in september consist of fixed rate instruments  and therefore  would not be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the debentures have a fixed interest rate of 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company entered into a new five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility in may which replaced the million three year revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire july borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at libor plus a premium that can range from basis points to basis points depending on certain leverage ratios 
during the year ended december   there was a minimal average outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and there was no outstanding balance as of december   therefore  there is no significant impact from a hypothetical increase in the interest rate related to the revolving credit facility during the year ended december  foreign exchange rates the company derives a portion of its revenues from various foreign sources 
revenue from the company s international financial print operations is denominated in foreign currencies  while some of its costs are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not use foreign currency hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company has reflected translation adjustments of   and  in its consolidated statements of stockholders equity for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these adjustments are primarily attributed to the fluctuation in value between the us dollar and the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar 
equity price risk the company s investments in marketable securities were approximately million as of december   primarily consisting of auction rate securities 
these securities are fixed income securities with minimal market fluctuation risk 
the company s defined benefit pension plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of the company s annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets 
to the extent there are fluctuations in equity values  the amount of the company s annual contribution could be affected 
for example  a decrease in equity prices could increase the amount of the company s annual contributions to the plan
