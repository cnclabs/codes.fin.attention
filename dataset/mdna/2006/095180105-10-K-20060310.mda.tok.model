item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  as well as the information in item  selected consolidated financial data 
overview we are an international industrial company with three business segments outdoor products  industrial and power equipment ipeg and lawnmower 
operating independently from one another  these segments focus on the manufacture and marketing of branded products to industrial companies and consumers 
our products are sold in over countries 
we believe we are a global leader in the sale of cutting chain and chainsaw accessories and a leading provider of timber harvesting equipment and zero turn riding lawnmowers to the north american markets 
our largest segment  outdoor products  accounted for of our revenue in this segment manufactures and markets forestry related chainsaw chain  guide bars  sprockets and accessories for chainsaw use  concrete cutting equipment and accessories  and outdoor equipment parts that include lawnmower blades and other accessories 
the segment s products are sold to oems for use on new chainsaws and landscaping equipment and to the retail replacement market through distributors  dealers and mass merchants 
during approximately of the segment s sales were to oems  with the remaining sold into the replacement market 
approximately of the segment s sales were outside of the us in  up from in the outdoor products segment s performance can be impacted by trends in the forestry industry  weather patterns and natural disasters  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
the segment f aces competitive price pressure from competitors on a worldwide basis 
the efficient manufacture of the segment s products is critical to ensure that it is competitive with its selling prices  as is successful marketing of newly developed products  such as our concrete cutting saws and replacement chain and bars 
this segment operates three manufacturing plants in the us  one in canada  one in brazil and one in china  all of which are focused on continuous cost improvement 
in we completed construction on the first phase of a facility in china  and are now manufacturing at this facility 
we also added capacity to our brazilian facility  and in we plan to continue to expand our capacity  with an emphasis on these two locations 
timely capital investment into these plants for added capacity and cost reductions  as well as effectively sourcing critical raw materials at favorable prices  is required to remain competitive 
the ipeg segment manufactures and markets timber harvesting equipment  industrial tractors and loaders  rotational bearings and swing drives 
sales in this segment accounted for of our total sales in sales are made through a dealer network to customers in the timber harvesting  materials handling and reclamation businesses and to pulp  paper and lumber mills 
ipeg also markets directly to oems 
the segment s customer base is concentrated in the southeastern us  with international sales amounting to of segment sales in  an increase from in in march  we entered into marketing  trademark licensing and supply agreements with caterpillar inc caterpillar to distribute a line of purpose built forestry equipment to caterpillar dealers with the brand name of timberking 
in february  these agreements were modified to replace the timberking brand with the caterpillar and cat brands 
under these agreements  some of the models of both the blount and the timberking or caterpillar product lines are manufactured at our facilities and others are manufactured at caterpillar s facilities 
we are responsible for the marketing of both lines of products  and these arrangements have increased the segment s sales in both domestic and international markets and increased the utilization of the segment s manufacturing plants 
the performance of ipeg is aligned with overall trends in the forestry industry  including the import export balance of wood products  the utilization of lumber and paper mill capacity in the us and the level of logging production 
the cyclical nature of the forestry industry can significantly impact the operating income and cash flow of ipeg from year to year 
to react to such trends  the segment must consistently manage its four us manufacturing plants on a lean basis  maximize pricing value for its products and minimize working capital 
the lawnmower segment represented of our sales in this segment manufactures and markets zero turn riding lawnmowers and related accessories under the dixon brand name 
dixon was a pioneer in zero turning technology 
this technology allows for more efficient grass cutting compared to conventional tractor style riding lawnmowers 
the segment s products are sold through full service dealers and distributors 
international sales were of total segment sales in  an increase from in the performance of the lawnmower segment is impacted by economic conditions  seasonal weather patterns and changes in competitive offerings 
operating income and cash flow in this segment are dependent on providing quality products at competitive prices 
critical to the success of the segment is the offering of enhancements to existing models on an annual basis and the periodic introduction of new products in response to market demand 
the lawnmower segment operates a single us facility for the manufacture and distribution of its products 
blount international  inc 
we maintain a corporate staff at our headquarters located in portland  oregon 
in addition to providing management oversight for the three business segments  the corporate staff manages our capital structure  administers various health and welfare plans and supervises regulatory  compliance and legal matters 
our capital structure has undergone noteworthy changes in and in we began the year with a significant amount of debt outstanding and a concentration of common stock ownership by affiliates of lehman brothers holdings inc  including a wholly owned subsidiary of lehman brothers merchant banking partners ii  lp lehman brothers  which owned approximately of our stock outstanding 
by the end of we had executed several refinancing transactions  reducing our total debt and increasing outstanding common stock 
also  by the end of  as a result of a secondary public offering of our stock  lehman brothers reduced its holdings to approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in  we made sizable voluntary prepayments of debt principal  further reducing outstanding debt 
in june  through an additional secondary public offering  lehman brothers further reduced their ownership percentage to ap proximately 
at the end of  notwithstanding these changes  our debt and leverage remain significant  and require the conservation of cash in order to reduce debt and increase stockholder value 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis  we experienced year over year increases in sales and operating income related to business growth 
we also continue to benefit from the refinancing activities completed during the second half of in addition  as a result of the increases in profitability in recent years  we recognized a favorable income tax benefit in to remove most of a valuation allowance on domestic deferred tax assets 
the table below provides a summary of results and primary factors contributing to the year over year change in millions

international sales grew million  or  with each of our three segments achieving their strongest sales growth outside of the us on a consolidated basis  us year over year sales growth was 
in the outdoor products segment international sales grew million  or  with increases in europe  latin america and asia  primarily in forestry related chainsaw parts and accessories  the impact of a weaker us dollar compared to the currencies of canada and brazil resulted in increased sales of million due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
the weaker us dollar also provided more competitive selling prices for our products contributing to the additional volume  and growth among our concrete cutting products was 
this included increases in unit volume for our saws and replacement chain of and  respectively 
blount international  inc 
in the industrial and power equipment segment international sales grew million  or  primarily in canada  but also with gains in australia  brazil and russia  continued expansion of the timberking line of timber harvesting equipment  which generated million worldwide in incremental sales through the caterpillar distribution channel  helping to access new markets 
total sales of timberking products in were million  and higher average selling prices in our industrial and power equipment segment contributed million 
this increase in average prices included increases in list prices and a reduction in competitive discounts 
in the lawnmower segment international sales grew million  or  and lawnmower unit sales grew by and additional sales revenue of million was generated from increases in selling price and a stronger product mix 
consolidated order backlog at december  was million  a decrease from million at december  the decrease is primarily in the industrial and power equipment segment 
operating income increased by million  or  from to  while our operating margin for was of sales compared to for a comparison of the two periods reflects the following favorable effect of sales volume in all of our segments  faster relative growth rates for our businesses with lower operating margins compared to our businesses with higher operating margins  the unfavorable effect of higher steel costs  the implementation of selling price increases in certain markets  and the unfavorable net effect of currency exchange rates  primarily due to a weaker us dollar relative to the canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
the increase in operating income reflects a year over year increase in gross profit of million 
our gross margin in was of sales  compared to in the year over year change in gross profit is presented below in millions gross profit increase decrease sales volume selling price and mix foreign exchange translation product cost and mix gross profit while the net effect of volume and price has been favorable across our businesses on a year over year basis  there have been several unfavorable factors influencing our gross margins 
the effect of mix within and between our businesses and distribution channels varies greatly  however  with the largest growth coming from our lower margin business units and distribution channels  the overall effect has been to lower gross margin 
currency exchange rates have decreased our gross profit during compared to while our international sales were increased by approximately million from the currency effect of a weaker us dollar  our product costs were negatively impacted by changes in currency 
our plants in canada and brazil were impacted by higher manufacturing costs resulting from the weaker us dollar estimated at million and million  respectively  compared to the prior year 
higher steel prices had an estimated adverse effect of million over the previous year 
in addition  an average wage increase to our employees of was instituted during to be market competitive 
these increases are offset partially by productivity gains in our plants and by selling price increases 
total selling  general and administrative expense sg a was equal to the prior year at million 
as a percent of sales  sg a decreased to in compared to in  continuing a trend of improved leverage on existing selling and administrative capacity 
one of the largest increases in has been the million increase in professional services expense  which included million of incremental expenses for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in legal expenses 
our international operating expense increased million compared to the prior year due to the weaker us dollar and its effect on the translation of foreign expenses 
other increases included million for bad debts and million for increases in r d costs 
compensation and benefits expense decreased by million compared to this net decreas e included increases of and for base compensation and benefits expense  respectively  offset by decreases for performance related compensation expenses 
advertising expense was down million and personnel related expense  primarily for travel  decreased by million 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in the changes in net income are due primarily to the following an increase in operating income of million  blount international  inc 
a decrease in net interest expense of million  primarily due to the decreases in average outstanding debt balances and borrowing rates associated with changes in our capital structure implemented in august  a decrease in other expense of million  due primarily to the million charge taken in august associated with our refinancing transactions  and a benefit of million for income taxes compared to an expense of million in  reflecting the reversal of the majority of a valuation allowance previously established on our us deferred income tax assets 
the reduction in interest expense is primarily due to the refinancing transactions that occurred in august  which reduced our average borrowing rates and outstanding debt balances  as well as the significant subsequent reductions of debt during total interest expense of million in compares to million in  which included a million non recurring charge for interest expense incurred during the day notice period involving the redemption of public debt 
the benefits gained from the refinancing and debt reduction have been partially offset this year by an increase of percentage points in the variable interest rate on our term loans at december  compared to december  interest income declined million to million for compared to million in interest income included million related to an income tax refund received in the fourth quarter of that year 
other expense decreased million due primarily to the charges taken in associated with our refinancing transactions 
net other expense in was million and included million to write off deferred financing costs resulting from the million prepayment of debt principal during the year 
in the fourth quarter of we also realized income of million for a legal settlement 
net other expense in of million included a million charge taken in the third quarter of associated with our august refinancing transactions 
this amount was composed of million for prepayment premiums  a million write off of deferred financing costs related to the extinguishment of debt  million to write off unamortized discount relating to the extinguished debt and million miscellaneous fees related to extinguishment of debt 
in the fourth quarter of we realized income of mil lion related to a legal settlement for one of our segments 
the income tax benefit of million contrasts sharply to the income tax provision of million 
the million year over year change is largely due to the reversal of most of the valuation allowance established on our us deferred income tax assets 
the valuation allowance was originally established in the third quarter of prior to the reversal of the valuation allowance  we were recognizing virtually no federal income tax expense for our us operations 
year ended december  amounts in thousands income before income taxes   provision benefit for income taxes   net income   effective tax rate our domestic net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets were fully reserved with a valuation allowance as of december  and throughout until the reversal of the valuation allowance on december  accordingly  we recognized minimal net federal domestic tax expense on our domestic income during or  except for incremental taxes on the repatriation of foreign earnings in in the third quarter of we determined that it was more likely than not that all of our us deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance was established against such deferred tax assets at that time 
at the end of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the majority of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
this change in the estimate reflects improvements in our profitability since the third quarter of stemming from business growth and reduced interest expense resulting from improvements in our capital structure 
as of december   we estimate our us net operating loss nol carryforward at million  and our state nol carryforwards at million 
these nol carryforwards are available to reduce cash taxes on future domestic taxable income 
the american jobs creation act of the act  includes a one time election to deduct of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the act 
any repatriation of foreign earnings was required to be completed by december  during the fourth quarter of we repatriated million of our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  and consequently during the year we recognized million of related income taxes after allowable net operating loss offsets

sales for the outdoor products segment increased million  or  in compared to of this increase  million was due to additional sales volume coming primarily from forestry related chainsaw parts and accessories in international markets  and growth in our concrete cutting products and accessories 
the combination of selling price increases and mix increased sales by million 
the effect of foreign currency translation on sales was an increase of million 
order backlog increased to million at december   compared to million at december   a increase 
the increase in sales occurred across most product lines but was particularly strong for chainsaw parts and accessories used for forestry or wood cutting applications 
products related to concrete cutting  which experienced growth in all major markets  increased in unit sales of saws and saw packages  and in unit sales of replacement diamond chain  for a net sales increase of million 
sales of outdoor equipment parts  which includes lawn mower blades and other accessories for lawn and garden use  increased by a modest  as adverse weather conditions in us markets limited growth 
geographically  the weak us dollar during provided improved competitive selling prices  and demand continued to grow  resulting in a increase in sales outside the us on top of s record results for sales outside the us this growth was led by our chain saw related products  with our largest increase in europe  where the re were good market conditions 
in latin america  increases were achieved in both oem and replacement markets 
finally  export sales increased in the far east primarily due to improved economic conditions in japan 
sales growth by channel was led by oems at  while replacement sales had a growth rate 
segment contribution to operating income increased million  or  in compared to the year over year change included a million increase in gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in sg a expense 
the favorable effect of increased volume was approximately million 
however  the net effect of foreign currency translation was unfavorable and estimated at million 
this net translation impact of currency is primarily from the effect stronger canadian and brazilian currencies had on our manufacturing costs in those countries  but also includes million of higher sg a expense worldwide  which encompasses our european operations as well 
these cost increases are partially offset by the favorable effect a weaker us dollar had on sales in these same countries 
other cost pressures included increases in average steel prices  with a year over year adverse effect estimated at million  higher energy prices  which added an estimated million in cost to operate our plants  and increases in capacity which have supported business growth but have also added to our fixed costs 
in addition  we incurred a loss of million for the first year of start up operations in our new plant in fuzhou  china 
these increases have been partially offset by increases in selling prices  productivity and a million net decrease in sg a expense after adjusting for the effect of foreign currency translation 
decreases in sg a expense included a million reduction in advertising expense  after a significant increase in for targeted brand awareness programs and a million reduction in performance compensation  after higher than normal expense in increases in sg a expense included million for normal increases in salaries and benefits  and million in bad debt expense 
the operating margin of in compares to in blount international  inc 
industrial and power equipment segment 
sales for the industrial and power equipment segment increased million  or  in compared to just over half of this growth  million  is due to favorable selling price and mix  with the realization of price increases estimated at million across all product lines  through a combination of list price increases and a reduction of cash discounts 
the favorable effect of higher volume was million  with the largest growth seen among tracked feller bunchers 
we also experienced strong growth in sales of loaders  partially due to the amount of felled timber from this year s hurricanes  and increases among forwarders and harvesters 
these increases are somewhat offset by a decrease in sales of our four wheel feller bunchers used for drive to tree harvesting 
this decrease in drive to t ree feller bunchers is attributed to dealer inventory corrections and a slight decline in our market share 
this increase in sales was distributed geographically across domestic and international markets  with the international sales increasing by million  or  over the previous year 
the increase in international sales included a sizable increase in canada  part of our traditional north american market  however  growth of international sales outside of canada also increased by million  or  over the previous year  largely through increases in australia  brazil and russia 
order backlog decreased to million at december  from million at december   due in part to improvements in production bottlenecks that had adversely affected our product deliveries in the prior period 
this segment is a cyclical  capital goods business whose results are closely linked to the performance of the forestry industry in general  particularly in our largest market  the southeastern us during  the growth r ate for the north american markets we compete in  measured in units sold  was flat compared to for most of our products 
sales of our gear and bearing products grew million  or  during the year and contributed to these results with improved price realization and increased unit volume 
segment contribution to operating income increased million  or  in compared to gross profit increased by approximately million  and reductions in sg a expense contributed an additional million to the year over year improvement 
the positive effect on gross profit from higher volume was limited to million  due to a shift in product mix away from segment manufactured products towards caterpillar manufactured products for which we receive a lower margin on sale 
cost increases included normal increases in wages and benefits  but also higher steel prices with an adverse effect estimated at million when compared to last year s average steel prices 
this shift in mix and cost increases have been largely offset by realization of price increases implemented early in the year and decreases in sg a spending 
sg a decreases included a million decrease in benefits  of which milli on represented lower workers compensation expense  and a million decrease in depreciation 
these decreases are partially offset by increases in engineering related expense toward compliance with new tier iii engine requirements for our heavy equipment 
this compliance related expense is expected to continue into the operating margin of in compares to in lawnmower segment 
sales for the lawnmower segment increased million  or  in compared to the growth resulted from increases in prices and a stronger product mix that provided million of additional sales  and a increase in unit volume that provided million of incremental sales 
the mix included a higher concentration of commercial mowers and a shift in our residential products away from plastic bodies toward heavier all steel body models 
these new models were well received in the market and helped us realize higher average selling prices in a difficult year for us lawnmower manufacturers 
geographically  growth in international sales led the way and provided an increase of million  or  over results 
growth in sales to us distributors  higher than in  also contributed in a year that continued t he transition away from a direct dealer sales effort in certain geographical markets  which began in  towards greater reliance on distributors 
sales to direct dealers were down from last year 
order backlog at december  was million  comparable to the december  order backlog of million 
segment contribution to operating income increased million  or  in compared to this increase reflected a decrease in gross profit offset by a decrease in sg a expense 
as expected  the shift towards distributors from dealers resulted in a reduction in both gross margin and sg a expense 
distributors receive a higher product discount but require fewer territory managers to support compared with direct dealers 
additional unit volume provided a favorable effect of million  but this was offset by million  net  from higher product costs  shift in model mix and price increases 
compensation expense in sg a decreased by million year over year  and advertising expense was also reduced million compared to the operating margin of in compares to in corporate expense 
corporate expense increased million  or  in compared to this increase includes million of additional professional services related to sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
salaries and benefits increased million 
in addition to normal increases in salaries and benefits  the increase also reflects the addition of certain professional positions to blount international  inc 
meet regulatory and compliance requirements  including sarbanes oxley compliance 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million for legal expenses and a million decrease for performance related compensation expenses 
higher costs to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements are expected to continue for the foreseeable future  although at a level lower than the implementation year costs 
stock based compensation expense is expected to increase sharply in to between million and million  with the implementation of new stock option expensing requirements 
future levels of stock based compensation expense will depend on many factors  including the quantity  type and vesting schedule of future grants made  the price of our stock  the volatility of our stock and risk free interest rates 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis  we experienced strong year over year growth in sales and operating income 
in the second half of we also took several actions aimed at improving our capital structure  future profitability and our ability to more quickly reduce debt 
our net income reflected the strong business growth  charges related to refinancing activities and a significantly reduced tax provision 
the tax provision reflected the establishment of a valuation allowance against all of our us deferred tax assets

the segment s international sales increased by  or million  in the effects of natural disasters had an unusually large impact on demand for our products in the us replacement market  and also contributed to the international sales growth 
the sale of new chainsaws by oems increased by a faster rate than normal 
contributing factors included lower price points for consumers through growing mass merchant distribution  higher oil costs resulting in increased use of wood as heating fuel and the increase in natural disasters within the us and elsewhere in the world 
the impact of a weaker us dollar resulted in increased sales of million due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
expansion of the timberking line of timber harvesting equipment in conjunction with the marketing  trademark licensing and supply agreements with caterpillar generated million in incremental sales 
an increase in the number of blount branded timber harvesting equipment units resulted in a million increase in sales  as the us forestry market continued to improve from a cyclical downturn that began in and ended in higher average selling prices in our timber harvesting equipment business added million 
this was primarily due to increases in net prices  including a reduction of competitive discounts 
the introduction of new dixon lawnmower products featuring all steel bodies helped to increase lawnmower segment sales by million  or 
blount international  inc 
operating income increased by million  or  from to the improvement is primarily due to a year over year gross profit increase of million  or  partially offset by a million  or  increase in selling  general and administrative expense sg a

gross profit from sales of our timber harvesting equipment increased by million due to an increase in selling prices  driven by an increase in market demand and reduced competitive discounting 
the net foreign exchange benefit was million  representing the favorable effect of the weaker us dollar on sales  partially offset by the impact on manufacturing costs of a stronger canadian dollar 
changes in product mix and increases in product cost inputs added million  or  to our cost of sales as higher raw material costs  employee wage increases and benefit costs were partially offset by productivity gains in our manufacturing plants 
the year over year effect of higher steel prices on product costs is estimated at million  offset partially by net selling price increases  which inclu de the reduction in competitive discounting estimated at million 
we instituted an average wage increase during sg a increased million  or  even as worldwide headcount included in our sg a expense decreased slightly  by almost 
sg a expense as a percent of sales decreased to in compared to in  demonstrating improved leverage on existing selling and administrative capacity 
the increase in total expense includes higher compensation expense  which increased by million  half of which is due to the increase in base compensation and the balance of which is due to increased performance based compensation and stock compensation expense 
international operating expenses increased million compared to the prior year due to the weaker us dollar 
increases in professional services to ensure compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and for legal expenses  were million 
the outdoor products segment incurred sg a increases from associated with the new enterprise resource planning system  which was activated in the fourth quarter of  of million  due to higher depreciation  increased costs for outside service providers and an increase in headcount 
advertising expense increased from by million as the company increased its brand awareness programs 
these increases were offset partially by a million decrease in insurance expense 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the changes in net income are due primarily to the following an increase in operating income of million  primarily from growth in sales volume 
a decrease in net interest expense of million  largely due to decreases in average outstanding debt balances and average borrowing costs associated with changes in our capital structure 
an increase in other expense of million  which includes a million charge taken in the third quarter of associated with our august refinancing transactions 
a decrease of million in provision for income taxes  due primarily to a million charge taken in the third quarter of to establish a valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets 
net interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease includes an million decrease in interest expense due to a combination of lower average debt outstanding and lower interest rates  partially offset by additional non recurring interest expense of million for interest incurred during the day notice period involving the redemption of public debt

outdoor products segment 
sales for the outdoor products segment increased million  or  in compared to the increase in sales occurred across all product lines but was particularly strong for chainsaw parts and accessories and the products related to concrete cutting 
the continued weakening of the us dollar during provided a better competitive selling price and demand surged  in part due to an increase in severe weather events 
this increase included million due to volume alone 
foreign currency translation provided an additional million 
geographically  most major markets experienced improved demand  with international sales increasing by from to million 
from a channel standpoint  sales to oems and replacement sales grew by and  respectively 
the higher growth rate in sales to oems relates to industry growth in sales of chainsaws by chainsaw manufacturers due to improvement in general economic conditions  reduced price points from sales by mass merchants  the increase in natural disasters and higher oil costs  which result in more woodcutting for use as fuel 
the segment s contribution to operating income increased by million  or  in due to a million  or  increase in gross profit  partially offset by a million  or  increase in sg a expenses 
the improvement in gross profit reflects higher sales volume amounting to million and the net favorable impact of foreign currency of million 
included in the sales volume impact are the favorable effects of increasing the utilization of the segment s manufacturing facilities to based upon a five day  three shift work week  which resulted in additional manufacturing cost leverage 
the net translation impact of currency is primarily from a stronger euro  partially offset by the effect of a stronger canadian dollar on our canadian manufacturing plant 
sg a costs increased due to the effects of currency translation on the international operations amounting to million  an increase of million for advertising targeted toward brand awareness programs  and higher costs of million related to a new enterprise resource planning system that was activated in the fourth quarter of these higher system costs include higher depreciation  increased costs for outside service providers and an increase in headcount 
sg a expense as a percent of sales decreased to in compared to in industrial and power equipment segment 
sales for the industrial and power equipment segment increased million  or  in compared to improvement in demand for our products yielded a  or million  increase in timber harvesting equipment sales 
increased volume accounted for million of the increase  with the effects of higher average net selling prices and product mix adding an additional million 
included in the increased volume was million of incremental sales related to our joint marketing agreement with caterpillar 
this segment is a cyclical  capital goods blount international  inc 
business whose results are closely linked to the performance of the forestry industry in general  particularly in our most important market the southeastern us during  industry conditions in north america continued to improve  with increases in pulp and lumber pricing  continued strong housing construction and a decline in imports of wood products due to the weakening of the us dollar 
furthermore  sales of mobile equipment rotational systems increased by  or million  reflecting improved demand in this business as well 
the segment s contribution to operating income increased by million  or  in compared to largely due to the increase in sales volume 
gross profit increased million  or  as increased sales volume contributed million 
gross profit as a percent of sales held even at 
operating leverage achieved through an increase in capacity utilization to in compared to in  was countered by downward pressure in unit margins due primarily to product mix 
steel costs increased by an estimated million  or  compared to this increase in steel costs was partially offset by increases in net selling prices and mix of products sold 
sg a costs increased by million  or  primarily due to incremental marketing costs targeted toward growth of international sales 
lawnmower segment 
sales for the lawnmower segment increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in sales reflected a increase in unit volume  accounting for million of the increase 
during the model year  which began late in  we introduced a new series of products under the ram name 
this model was the segment s first all steel body residential mower and was targeted for the growing high end residential and low end commercial zero turn riding mower market segments 
in  dixon continued with this focus  introducing additional all steel models for the model year 
the successful introduction of these product improvements has resulted in a increase in average unit selling prices  even with the effect of our shift in marketing strategy towards distributors  where average prices are lower th an through the dealer channel 
lawnmower segment contribution to operating income was million in  compared to a loss of million in this improvement was primarily due to the million increase in gross profit generated by the increase in unit sales 
the segment s manufacturing plant operated at approximately of capacity in compared to in  helping offset other upward pressures in average production costs 
the combination of product cost and mix added an estimated million to cost of sales from the prior year

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources since our merger and recapitalization transactions see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have carried significant amounts of debt 
in the last three years we have initiated several actions to reduce our debt and related interest expense 
in we entered into a new senior credit facility to replace a previous credit facility 
in we executed a series of transactions  resulting in a reduction of debt and the average interest rates on that debt as well as an increase in outstanding common stock 
in we made significant voluntary prepayments of principal to further reduce our debt 
on august   we executed a series of significant refinancing transactions 
these transactions  referred to as the refinancing transactions  included the issuance of  shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds to the company of million  the issuance of new senior subordinated notes due in  which generated net proceeds to the company of million  and the amendment and restatement of our existing senior credit facilities  including an increase in amounts available  with the total amounts drawn increasing by million 
the amendment and restatement of our senior credit facilities included  among other things  a reduction in interest rates  revisions to financial covenant ratios  the addition of maximum leverage ratios and revision of certain repayment terms 
the amended and restated credit facilities consisted of a revolving credit facility of up to million and term loans that included a million canadian term loan facility  a million term b loan facility and a million second collateral institutional loan scil facility 
we used the net proceeds of the refinancing transactions as follows the redemption of our senior notes with million principal outstanding  the redemption of our senior subordinated notes with million principal outstanding  the repayment of our convertible preferred equivalent security principal and accrued interest in the aggregate amount of million  and the payment of related premiums of million 
blount international  inc 
on december   we again amended our senior credit facilities to provide  among other things  for the repayment and elimination of the million scil established in august with the proceeds from a loan made possible by an increase in the term b loan limit  an adjustment to certain financial covenants and a lower borrowing rate 
interest and principal payment obligations have been reduced as a result of these changes to our capital structure and we are now benefiting from lower interest expense 
interest expense has been reduced primarily from a reduction in our average borrowing rate and by the reduction in the principal amount of long term debt 
the effects of these reductions are partially offset by an increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  and during  using a three month libor rate as a benchmark  our variable interest rates increased by a net amount of percentage points 
this increase in our variable interest rate includes increases in the three month libor rates during the year but is also partially offset by a reduction under the terms of our senior credit agreement that occurred in june of this year when our credit rating was upgraded by a rating agency 
our annual interest expense may continue to vary in the futur e because the senior credit facility interest rates are variable 
our weighted average interest rate on all debt has increased from as of december  to as of december  cash interest paid in was million compared to million in  excluding net cash interest paid to redeem public debt 
cash interest paid in was million 
total debt at december  was million compared with total debt at december  of million  a decrease of million 
outstanding debt as of december  consisted of term loans of million and senior subordinated notes of million 
our debt continues to be significant  and future debt service payments continue to represent substantial obligations 
this degree of leverage may adversely affect our operations and could have important consequences 
see item a  risk factors  substantial leverage for further discussion 
in  we made million of voluntary prepayments of principal on our term loans 
these principal prepayments will further reduce our future interest expense  and we intend to make additional voluntary prepayments of principal on our term loans during once repaid  term loan principal cannot be re borrowed under the terms of our senior credit facilities 
we intend to fund working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months through expected cash flows generated from operations 
interest on our debt is payable in arrears according to varying interest rates and periods 
we expect our remaining resources will be sufficient to cover any additional increases in working capital and capital expenditures 
there can be no assurance  however  that these resources will be sufficient to meet our needs 
we may also consider other options available to us in connection with future liquidity needs 
under the senior credit agreement  the amount available to be drawn on our million revolving credit facility could be restricted by our leverage ratio and first lien credit facilities leverage ratio 
availability is further reduced for any outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility 
at december  and  the company had no amount drawn down on this facility and had borrowing availability of million and million  respectively 
the company and all of its domestic subsidiaries other than blount  inc guarantee the obligations of blount  inc under the senior credit facilities 
the obligations under the senior credit facilities are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of blount  inc and its domestic subsidiaries  as well as a pledge of all of blount  inc s capital stock held by blount international  inc and pledges of all of the stock of domestic subsidiaries held by blount  inc in addition  blount  inc  together with a domestic subsidiary in certain cases where applicable  has pledged of the stock of its non domestic subsidiaries as additional collateral 
our senior credit facilities are subject to certain reporting and financial covenant compliance requirements 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  non compliance with these covenants could result in severe limitations to our overall liquidity  and the term loan lenders could require actions for immediate repayment of outstanding amounts  potentially requiring sale of our assets 
our debt is not subject to any triggers that would require early payment of debt due to any adverse change in our credit rating  although a decrease in our credit rating can result in increases to our borrowing rate 
the senior credit facility agreements also restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the revolving credit facility expires on august  and the term b and canadian term loan facilities expire on august  the senior subordinated notes are due in full on august  required principal payments are adjusted after each voluntary prepayment of principal we make on the term loans 
as of december   the term b loan facility requires quarterly payments of million  with a final payment of million due on the maturity date 
as of december   the canadian term loan facility requires quarterly payments of thousand  with a final payment of million due on the maturit y date 
blount international  inc 
as a result of the refinancing transactions  the company has one registered debt security  the senior subordinated notes 
these notes are issued by blount  inc  are fully and unconditionally  jointly and severally  guaranteed by the company and all of its domestic subsidiaries guarantor subsidiaries other than blount  inc all guarantor subsidiaries of these senior subordinated notes are owned  directly or indirectly  by the company

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
we do not have any variable interest entities or off balance sheet arrangements as defined by this pronouncement 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity components  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and consistent with industry practice 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record reductions to selling prices as products are shipped 
these reductions are based on competitive and market conditions  in addition to specific customer contracts in some instances 
these reductions are estimated and recorded at the time of shipment either through a reduction to invoice or the establishment of an accrual for payment at a later date 
the amount accrued may increase or decrease prior to payment due to customer performance and market conditions 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses against our recorded accounts receivable 
such allowance is based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customers financial statements and conditions through monitoring services 
based on these reviews  additional allowances may be required and are recorded in the appropriate period 
specific industry market conditions can significantly increase or decrease the level of inventory on hand in any of our business units 
we adjust for changes in demand by reducing or increasing production levels 
we estimate the required inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventory by assessing inventory turns and market selling prices on a product by product basis 
we maintain such reserves until a product is sold or market conditions require a change in the reserves 
we perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level 
we also perform an impairment analysis of goodwill whenever circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the impairment tests are performed by determining the fair values of the reporting units using a discounted projected cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values of the reporting units  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
events or changes in circumstances may occur that could create underperformance relative to projected future cash flows  which would create future impairments 
we offer certain warranties with the sale of our products 
the warranty obligation is recorded at the point of revenue recognition as a charge to cost of goods sold and as a liability on the balance sheet  and is estimated based upon historic customer claims  supplier performance and new product reliability analysis 
should a change in trend occur in customer claims  an increase or decrease in the warranty liability may be necessary 
we incur expenses in connection with product liability claims as a result of alleged product malfunctions or defects 
we maintain insurance for a portion of this exposure and record a liability for our non insured obligations 
we estimate our product liability obligations on a case by case basis  in addition to a review of product performance trends 
these estimated obligations may be increased or decreased as more information on specific cases becomes available or performance trends change 
we determine our post retirement obligations on an actuarial basis that requires management to make certain assumptions 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to be used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation and the anticipated trend in health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and consideration is given to market conditions  as well as to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and no 
 employers blount international  inc 
accounting for post retirement costs other than pensions 
actual results could differ materially from these assumptions 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was for and we anticipate the same rate to be utilized in we believe this rate is reasonable  given the asset composition and long term historic trends 
we lowered our discount rate assumption to to determine our plan liabilities at december   from in the previous year  due to the market declines in benchmark interest rates 
we assumed that health care costs in would increase by and future increases would decline by per year until is reached 
our annual post retirement expenses can be impacted by changes in these assumptions 
a change in the return on assets would change annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the discount rate as of december  would result in million in increased pension e xpenses in  and a increase in the discount rate as of december  would decrease pension expense in by million 
a increase in the health care cost trend assumption for and beyond would change annual post retirement medical costs by approximately million a year and a decrease in the health care cost trend assumption for and beyond would change annual post retirement medical costs by approximately million a year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
included in recorded tax liabilities are estimated amounts related to uncertain tax positions 
actual tax liabilities may differ materially from these estimates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as of december  we have a deferred tax asset valuati on allowance of million

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be applied prospectiv ely and are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application permitted

the long term impact of the adoption of sfas no

the sec has recently clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of sfas no

had we been accounting for such stock options using the accelerated amortization schedule for those employees that became eligible for retirement within the vesting period  the effect on stock based compensation expense in the pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in note would be immaterial for all periods presented

forward looking statements forward looking statements in this report  including without limitation management s outlook  guidance  expectations  beliefs  plans  indications  estimates  anticipations  and their variants  as defined by the private securities litigation reform act of  are based upon available information and upon assumptions that the company believes are reasonable  however  these forward looking statements involve certain risks and should not be considered indicative of actual results that the company may achieve in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivatives 
when utilized  derivatives are used as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 
see interest rate risk and commodity price risk below for discussion of our expectations regarding future use of interest rate and commodity price derivatives 
interest rate risk 
we manage our ratio of fixed to variable rate debt with the objective of achieving a mix that management believes is appropriate 
historically  we have  blount international  inc 
on occasion  entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed and variable interest rates based on agreed upon notional amounts and we have entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the interest rate of an anticipated debt issue 
at december  and  no derivative financial instruments were outstanding to hedge interest rate risk 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt outstanding by million 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates on our variable rate long term debt for the duration of one year would increase interest expense by approximately million in foreign currency exchange risk 
approximately of the outdoor products segment s sales and of its operating costs and expenses were transacted in foreign currencies in as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of the outdoor products segment s reported sales and operating income 
historically  our principal exposures have been related to local currency operating costs and expenses in canada and brazil  and local currency sales and expenses in europe 
during the past three years  we have not used derivatives to manage any foreign currency exchange risk and  at december   no foreign currency exchange derivatives were outstanding 
the table below illustrates the estimated effect of a hypothetical immediate change in major currencies defined for us as the euro  canadian dollar and brazilian real effect of weaker us dollar dollar amounts in thousands sales cost of sales operating income euro    canadian dollar    brazilian real commodity price risk 
we secure raw materials through purchasing functions at each of our operating divisions 
these functions are staffed by professionals who determine the sourcing of materials by assessing quality  availability  price and service of potential vendors 
when possible  multiple vendors are utilized to ensure competitive prices and to minimize risk of lack of availability of materials 
some of these raw materials are subject to price volatility over time 
we have not hedged against the price volatility of any raw materials within our operating segments by using any derivative instruments during  or our largest sourced commodity is steel  purchases of which in the year ended december  amounted to approximately million 
a hypothetical immediate change in the price of steel would have an estimated million effect on pre tax income in we utilize multiple suppliers to purchase steel 
raw material price volatility has not been significant in recent years  with the exception of steel pricing  which has risen sharply over the past few years 
we estimate the impact of this increase resulted in our cost of purchased steel to be million higher in than in  and million higher in than in partially to offset this cost increase  some selling prices to our customers have been increased 
we source many of our outdoor care products from asia through brokers and we anticipate expanding this practice in our other divisions 
for example  we believe that we can source both timber harvest ing and lawnmower components at a lower cost from international locations 
historically  we have not incurred any issues of significance in sourcing internationally  in part due to the fact that there are multiple suppliers for the products we purchase
