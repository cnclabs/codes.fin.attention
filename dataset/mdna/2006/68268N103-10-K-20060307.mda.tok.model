item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under item executive summary overview northern border partners is a publicly traded delaware limited partnership formed in our common units are listed on the nyse under the trading symbol nbp 
our purpose is to acquire  own and manage pipeline and other midstream energy assets 
our equity consists of a general partner interest and a limited partner interest 
oneok is our majority general partner and holds a combined general and limited partner interest in us of 
we provide natural gas transportation services and are a leading transporter of natural gas imported from canada to the us in addition  we gather  process and compress natural gas  fractionate natural gas liquids  and transport coal slurry 
our operations are conducted through the following three business segments interstate natural gas pipeline  natural gas gathering and processing  and coal slurry pipeline 
in  the interstate natural gas pipeline segment accounted for of our consolidated operating income 
operating revenue of this segment is derived from transportation contracts under ferc regulated tariffs 
customers with firm service transportation agreements pay a fee known as a demand charge to reserve pipeline capacity  regardless of use  for the term of their contracts 
firm service transportation customers also pay a fee known as a commodity charge that is based on the volume of natural gas they transport 
customers with interruptible service transportation agreements may utilize available capacity on our pipelines after firm service transportation requests are satisfied 
interruptible service customers are assessed commodity charges only 
in  of the interstate natural gas pipeline segment s revenue was derived from demand charges 
the natural gas gathering and processing segment accounted for of our consolidated operating income in operating revenue of this segment is derived primarily from percentage of proceeds and fee based contracts 
under percentage of proceeds contracts  we retain a percentage of the commodities that we gather and process in exchange for our services 
we are exposed to commodity price risk when we sell the natural gas and natural gas liquids we retain in the open market 
we use derivative instruments to mitigate our sensitivity to fluctuations in the price of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
information about our business  properties and strategy can be found under item  business  and a description of our risk factors can be found under item a  risk factors 
our business environment a healthy long term natural gas supply outlook is critical for our operations 
western canada supply trends are particularly important to us because the majority of the natural gas we transport is produced in the western canada sedimentary basin 
we estimate that northern border pipeline transported approximately of canada s natural gas export volume in in  canadian natural gas supplies available for export were relatively flat compared with prior years 
canadian natural gas supplies available for export could be impacted by the development of oil sand reserves due to increased natural gas consumption associated with production 
increased production of crude oil from oil sand reserves in canada could reduce natural gas available for export to the us if production and the related demand for natural gas are significantly greater than supply growth 
despite this possibility  we anticipate that canadian natural gas supplies available for export in will be similar to once new pipeline projects associated with the mackenzie delta in northern canada and alaska are constructed  we could have access to new supply sources 
we gather and process unconventional natural gas produced in the powder river basin and conventional natural gas in the williston and wind river basins 
unconventional natural gas differs from conventional natural gas only by its reservoirs  which have characteristics that make production more difficult compared with conventional natural gas reservoirs 
we expect coalbed methane gas production in the powder river basin to remain flat or increase moderately in we expect casinghead gas production in the williston basin to increase at least through but at a slower rate of growth compared with because of curtailment of crude oil production due to refinery outages and constraints in crude oil pipeline shipments 
this situation in the williston basin  which began in late  is expected to continue moderately affecting natural gas production at least through we serve natural gas markets in the midwestern us and provide our customers with access to the chicago market area  which is the third largest market area hub in north america 
although domestic demand for natural gas is expected to remain near levels in  relatively high prices may significantly impact natural gas supply and demand 
strong natural gas prices may lead to increased production  supply source and market competition  and demand destruction and volatility 
supply competition from other sources of natural gas can adversely impact demand for transportation on our pipelines 
new supply from the rocky mountain region transported by a competitor impacted demand for service on northern border pipeline at certain times during and will continue to put pressure on us when market demand is light 
in august  kinder morgan energy partners  lp kinder morgan and sempra pipelines storage proposed to construct a natural gas pipeline that would transport natural gas from the rocky mountain region to the upper midwestern and eastern us in february  kinder morgan announced that the bcf d   mile rockies express pipeline was fully subscribed 
the proposed project s interim service to the mid continent region  anticipated to begin in late  may adversely impact the value of transportation service on our pipelines which currently serve the midwestern us markets 
production in the wind river basin  where we own an equity interest in a gathering system  however  may increase as a result of the greater pipeline access the project is expected to provide 
temperatures in the us were above normal averages from december through november  according to the noaa national climate data center 
during the first half of  the market responded by increasing natural gas storage injection activity  which resulted in natural gas in storage at levels greater than the five year average 
with ample natural gas already in storage and the us experiencing higher than normal summer temperatures during the third quarter of  demand for canadian natural gas increased to meet demand for electricity 
in addition  demand for natural gas from the chicago market area increased as a result of decreased production in the gulf coast region due to infrastructure disruptions following hurricanes katrina and rita 
december began with unusually cold conditions across the us that retreated in the last two weeks of the year and above normal temperatures resumed in january natural gas storage is essential to balance natural gas supply with temperature driven seasonal demand 
as the market gains the ability to better align its demand with supply by utilizing natural gas storage  we anticipate demand for transportation services will become increasingly volatile 
with new canadian storage projects expected to go in service during  we anticipate that increased storage may reduce demand for northern border pipeline s transportation capacity during the spring and early summer months and increase demand during the winter months 
year in review in  income from continuing operations of million exceeded income from continuing operations by due to improved results from the gathering and processing segment and the benefit of non recurring items which offset decreased demand for transportation capacity on northern border pipeline 
during the second quarter of  increased storage injection activity of canadian natural gas negatively impacted demand for northern border pipeline s firm service transportation when several contracts expired 
in order to maximize revenue  northern border pipeline discounted transportation rates primarily on a short term basis 
as western canadian working gas in storage rose to high levels and summer temperatures were higher than normal  demand for northern border pipeline s transportation capacity also increased 
while we anticipate that demand for northern border pipeline s transportation capacity in will be similar to demand based on our expectations of canadian natural gas supply and demand for natural gas in the midwestern us  the level of discounting in the future may vary from depending upon transient market conditions  which are difficult to predict 
in  northern border pipeline accounted for of our consolidated operating revenue 
the outcome of northern border pipeline s rate case filed in november could have a significant impact on our financial results because the resulting tariff will specify the maximum rates the pipeline can charge its customers for natural gas transportation service 
in december  the ferc identified the issues raised in the proceeding and accepted the proposed rates but suspended their effectiveness until may  at that time  northern border pipeline will collect the new rates  which will be subject to refund until final resolution of the rate case following hearings conducted by the ferc or by settlement 
a change in northern border pipeline s rates will not affect earnings until final resolution with the ferc staff and a majority of our customers is reached and subsequently approved by the ferc  which may not occur until we continue to seek internal growth opportunities to expand our business 
we commenced construction on several interstate natural gas pipeline projects in in september  the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity for northern border pipeline s chicago iii expansion project  which will increase the pipeline s transportation capacity from harper  iowa to the chicago market area by mmcf d to mmcf d 
the additional capacity is fully subscribed for five and one half years to ten years 
the chicago iii expansion project is expected to be in service in april in october  midwestern gas transmission received a positive environmental assessment from the ferc for its eastern extension project 
the eastern extension project will extend midwestern gas transmission s transportation service miles into tennessee 
the eastern extension project s proposed in service date of november will likely be delayed since the ferc s certificate of public convenience and necessity for the project is still pending 
in november  midwestern gas transmission completed its southbound expansion project  which increased the pipeline s southbound capacity by mdth d 
our overall business strategy encompasses a focus on growth opportunities that will balance our supply source and market risk exposures 
since  our business mix has evolved from primarily interstate pipeline transportation service operations to our present mix  which includes natural gas gathering and processing operations based on ebitda 
strong natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in resulted in improved consolidated results due to our natural gas gathering and processing segment 
in august  we acquired an additional interest in fort union gas gathering to bring our total interest to 
during  several events marked the end of our relationship with enron 
in may  our transition from cce holdings  through which enron provided certain services to oneok was completed 
in june  northern border pipeline  crestone gathering and bear paw energy sold their unsecured claims against enron and enron north america to a third party  which sale is reflected in our operating results 
in addition  enron was the grantor of the enron gas pipeline employee benefit trust trust  which when taken together with the enron corp 
medical plan for inactive participants medical plan constituted a voluntary employees beneficiary association or veba under the internal revenue code 
the trust was established as a result of a regulatory requirement for the inclusion of certain costs for post employment medical benefits in the rates established for the affected pipelines  including northern border pipeline 
in  enron began the necessary steps to partition the assets of the trust and the related liabilities of the medical plan among all of the participating employers of the trust  including northern plains  and requested the enrolled actuary to prepare an analysis and recommendation for the allocation of the trust s assets and associated liabilities 
in june  enron filed an amended motion in bankruptcy court seeking approval to terminate the trust and to distribute its assets among certain identified companies 
if enron s relief is granted as requested  northern plains would assume retiree benefit liabilities  estimated as of november   of approximately million and trust assets of approximately million 
northern natural gas company  a participating employer of the trust through june   along with other parties filed a motion alleging that the allocation of assets and liabilities of the trust should be decided in a pending lawsuit filed in the us district court for the district of nebraska and not in bankruptcy court 
the lawsuit filed in nebraska was dismissed 
on february   we announced a series of proposed transactions expected to increase unitholder value and facilitate additional growth opportunities  including the sale of a partnership interest in northern border pipeline to tc pipelines  northern plain s acquisition of transcanada s general partner interest and our purchase of oneok s entire gathering and processing  natural gas liquids  and pipelines and storage segments 
upon completion of these transactions  oneok will own approximately million of our limited partner units  which  when combined with the general partnership interest acquired from transcanada  will increase their total interest in us to 
we expect the acquisition of oneok s assets and the sale of a portion of our interest in northern border pipeline will be immediately accretive to our distributable cash flow 
in addition  we anticipate increasing our cash distribution to unitholders by the end as a result of greater cash flow associated with the additional assets 
the acquisition will result in a more diversified master limited partnership and an improved ability to fund future growth 
additional information about the proposed transactions is included under liquidity and capital resources  of this section  item  business general development of business  item a  risk factors  item  legal proceedings  item  market for registrant s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  and item  certain relationships and related transactions 
we believe we are well positioned for growth in the natural gas industry continues to be a critical component of the energy infrastructure in the us we expect strong natural gas prices and continually improving technology will encourage producers to replace depleted reserves with new supply sources providing the natural gas transportation and gathering and processing sectors with growth opportunities 
our commitment to fee based businesses and disciplined hedging policies will continue to be the foundation upon which we will strive to grow our businesses and provide consistent distributions to unitholders 
black mesa on december   black mesa s transportation contract with the coal supplier of the mohave generating station expired and our coal slurry pipeline operations were shut down as expected 
we expect the impact associated with the shutdown will be a reduction of net income of approximately million in  which includes approximately million to million of operations and maintenance expense we expect to incur related to stand by costs 
under a consent decree  the mohave generating station must complete significant pollution control investments to operate in the future 
in addition  issues surrounding the use of an alternative water source for the coal slurry pipeline must be resolved 
the original water source was an aquifer in the navajo nation and hopi tribe joint use area 
black mesa is working to resolve coal slurry transportation issues and interested parties continue to negotiate water and coal supply issues so that operations may resume in the future 
if these issued are resolved and the project receives a favorable environmental impact statement  portions of the pipeline would be modified or reconstructed to repair normal wear related to use 
if the pipeline is reconstructed  we anticipate black mesa s capital expenditures for the project will be approximately million to million beginning in late and  supported by revenue from a new transportation contract  for an anticipated in service date during if the mohave generating station is permanently closed  we expect to incur pipeline removal and remediation costs of approximately million to million  net of salvage  and a non cash impairment charge of approximately million related to the remaining undepreciated cost of the pipeline assets and goodwill 
we may be required to take an impairment charge in accordance with gaap prior to final resolution of the issues concerning mohave generating station even though the project may ultimately proceed 
each quarter  we will take into consideration our assumptions and estimates about economic conditions and the probability of black mesa s future profitability 
if an event or change in circumstance occurs that potentially impacts our assumptions and estimates  we will be required to test the assets for impairment 
if our testing indicates that the carrying amount of black mesa s assets exceed their fair value  we would recognize an impairment charge 
additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates related to asset impairment is included under the following sections  critical accounting estimates  and in note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions  with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty  that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the following summarizes our critical accounting estimates  which should be read in conjunction with note of the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
we review goodwill for possible impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill might exceed its current fair value 
an assessment is made for each of our business segments by comparing the fair value of the business  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to the book value  including goodwill  of each reporting unit 
in addition  we obtained a business valuation from an independent valuation firm of our coal slurry pipeline segment in if the fair value of the business is less than the book value including the goodwill  goodwill is deemed to be impaired and we are required to perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second test  we calculate the fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated fair value of the goodwill  we will record a goodwill impairment charge 
we determine fair value using the discounted cash flow method for each of our business segments 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
our assumptions and estimates are based on our current business strategy taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions  as well as our analysis of future expectations 
our evaluation of our coal slurry pipeline segment incorporated an assessment of the probabilities of permanent closure of the mohave generating station 
see executive summary of this section for further discussion of black mesa s shutdown 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill for each of our business segments using the methodology described above 
we determined there is no goodwill impairment 
the business valuation of the coal slurry pipeline segment we received from the independent valuation firm concluded there was no impairment to goodwill 
if actual results differ from our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to a goodwill impairment charge 
at december   we had million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   goodwill per business segment was million  million and million for our interstate natural gas pipeline  natural gas gathering and processing and coal slurry pipeline segments  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may exceed their fair value 
we assess our long lived assets for impairment based on sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fair values are based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
if the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which is based on future discounted cash flow 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we will prepare a fair value analysis when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may exceed the fair value 
management reviews our assets at the end of each reporting period to determine if any events that would trigger asset impairment have occurred 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
our assumptions and estimates are based on our current business strategy  taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions as well as our analysis of future expectations 
using the impairment review methodology described herein  we determined there was no asset impairment in if actual results differ from our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair values  we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
regulatory assets the interstate natural gas pipeline segment s accounting policies conform to sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
we consider several factors to evaluate our continued application of the provisions of sfas no 
such as potential deregulation of our pipelines  anticipated changes from cost based ratemaking to another form of regulation  increasing competition that limits our ability to recover costs  and regulatory actions that limit rate relief to a level insufficient to recover costs 
certain assets that result from the ratemaking process are reflected on the balance sheet as regulatory assets 
if we determine future recovery of these assets is no longer probable as a result of discontinuing application of sfas no 
or other regulatory actions  we would be required to write off the regulatory asset at that time 
as of december   the interstate natural gas pipeline segment reflected regulatory assets of million that we expect to recover from our customers over varying time periods up to years 
contingencies our accounting for contingencies covers a variety of business activities  including contingencies for legal and environmental liabilities 
we accrue these contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we base our estimates on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution 
actual results may differ from our estimates resulting in an impact  positive or negative  on earnings

operating income was relatively flat as a result of the significantly greater contribution by the natural gas gathering and processing segment offset by decreased operating income from the interstate natural gas pipeline segment 
both the interstate natural gas pipeline and the natural gas gathering and processing segments benefited from the sale of their bankruptcy claims related to enron and enron north america in income from continuing operations increased million  or  despite higher interest expense of million as a result of interest rates 
equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million  or  due to the settlement of our preferred a shares with bighorn gas gathering and improved results from our gathering and processing joint ventures interests 
discontinued operations included an after tax gain of million related to the sale of border midstream s undivided interest in the gregg lake obed pipeline in interstate natural gas pipeline segment income from continuing operations decreased million  or  in compared with primarily as a result of the following unsold transportation capacity on northern border pipeline  discounted transportation rates on northern border pipeline  and increased operations and maintenance expense  partially offset by the sale of northern border pipeline s bankruptcy claims against enron and enron north america 
operating revenue decreased million in compared with due to northern border pipeline s decreased demand for transportation capacity 
during the second quarter of  contracts for mmcf d of capacity on the port of morgan  montana to ventura  iowa portion of the pipeline expired 
some of this firm transportation capacity was not sold 
to maximize revenue  northern border pipeline discounted transportation rates primarily on a short term basis and sold most of its remaining capacity in revenue from firm service transportation decreased million as a result of uncontracted and discounted capacity 
partially offsetting this decrease  northern border pipeline recognized revenue of million from the sale of its bankruptcy claims for transportation contracts and associated guarantees against enron and enron north america 
in  northern border pipeline recognized revenue of million due to an additional day of transportation service because of the leap year 
operations and maintenance expense increased million  or  in compared with primarily due to the settlement or anticipated settlement of several outstanding issues related to enron which reduced expenses in the resolution of our potential obligation for costs related to the termination of enron s cash balance plan  the settlement for certain administrative expenses for and  and an adjustment to our allowance for doubtful accounts related to bankruptcy claims held by northern border pipeline reduced expenses by million in in  operational gas volume imbalances on viking gas transmission resulted in a million net increase of operations and maintenance expense 
interest expense increased million in compared with due to higher average interest rates partially offset by decreased average debt outstanding 
equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates represent earnings from our one third interest in guardian pipeline 
minority interests in net income represent the minority interest in northern border pipeline 
natural gas gathering and processing segment income from continuing operations increased million  or  in compared with primarily as a result of the following increased gathering and processing volumes in the williston basin  higher commodity prices realized on equity natural gas and natural gas liquids derived from percentage of proceeds contracts  the sale of bear paw energy and crestone gathering s bankruptcy claims against enron and enron north america  the settlement of preferred a shares in bighorn gas gathering  and increased equity earnings from our joint venture interests 
operating revenue increased million  or nearly  in compared with due to our williston basin results 
williston basin operating revenue is derived primarily from the sale of natural gas and natural gas liquids gathered and processed under percentage of proceeds contracts 
williston basin gathering and processing volumes increased mmcf d  or  as a result of accelerated production and drilling activity across the entire basin driven by strong natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
the charlie creek expansion project and beaver creek expansion project also helped to increase volume and improve utilization at our grasslands facility 
optimization projects at the grasslands and baker facilities increased natural gas liquids recoveries 
the increased williston basin volumes more than offset the decreased powder river basin volumes related to production declines and the diversion of a producer s volume to its own gathering lines during the year 
better prices were also realized on our sales of natural gas and natural gas liquids retained through percentage of proceeds contracts  which also contributed to the segment s increased operating revenue 
the weighted average price of natural gas realized  net of the effects of hedging  was per mmbtu in compared with per mmbtu in the weighted average price of natural gas liquids realized  net of the effects of hedging  was per gallon in compared with per gallon in commodity sales more than offset the impact of modestly lower gathering rates in the powder river basin 
product purchases increased million in compared with product purchases as a percent of operating revenue increased to of operating revenue in compared with of operating revenue in due to declining percentage of proceeds contract margins 
product purchases reflect the amounts we paid to producers for raw natural gas 
operations and maintenance expense increased million  or  in compared with operations and maintenance expense included additional expenses related to expansions  pipeline repairs and employee costs of million offset by the recovery of bear paw energy and crestone gathering s allowance for doubtful accounts related to enron and enron north america of million in in  resolution of our potential obligation for costs related to the termination of enron s cash balance plan and an adjustment to our allowance for doubtful accounts related to bankruptcy claims reduced expenses by million 
we also sold two non strategic gathering systems and compressor equipment in the powder river basin and recognized a million gain in operations and maintenance expense in equity earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million  or  in compared with increased volumes and transportation rates are reflected in our equity earnings from our investments in bighorn gas gathering  fort union gas gathering and lost creek gathering 
crestone energy s acquisition of an additional interest in fort union gas gathering also contributed to our equity earnings growth 
we also recognized million of equity earnings related to our preferred a shares held in bighorn gas gathering that were due to us for and resulting from a settlement agreement with our partner in bighorn gas gathering 
provisions of the joint venture agreement provided for cash flow incentives based on well connections to the gathering system 
the settlement agreement cancelled and effectively redeemed bighorn gas gathering s outstanding preferred a shares held by us and preferred b shares held by our partner in bighorn gas gathering and eliminated future incentives 
in  we recorded million of equity earnings related to our preferred a shares that were due to us for coal slurry pipeline segment on december   our coal slurry pipeline operations were shut down 
we incurred one time termination costs of million in the fourth quarter which were reflected in the segment s operations and maintenance expense 
comparison of the year ended december   with year ended december  consolidated results operating revenue increased million  or  in compared with as a result of higher interstate natural gas pipeline segment revenue due to expired regulatory conditions and improved natural gas gathering and processing segment results 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our natural gas gathering and processing segment s tangible assets and goodwill 
excluding the impairment charge  operating income increased million  or  in compared with due to several enron related settlements and the sale of non strategic gathering and processing assets which reduced expenses in income from continuing operations  excluding the impairment charge  increased million  or  which included lower interest expense of million as a result of decreased average debt outstanding 
discontinued operations included an after tax gain of million related to the sale of the gladys and mazeppa processing plants located in alberta  canada in interstate natural gas pipeline segment income from continuing operations increased million  or  in compared with primarily as a result of the following increased revenue  decreased northern border pipeline operations and maintenance expense  and decreased northern border pipeline interest expense 
operating revenue increased million in compared with due to improved results from all three interstate natural gas pipelines 
northern border pipeline s operating revenue increased million primarily as a result of expired regulatory conditions under its previous rate case settlement  which enabled the pipeline to generate and retain million from the sale of short term firm capacity and million from new service revenue 
northern border pipeline also recognized revenue of million due to an additional day of transportation service because of the leap year 
in  viking gas transmission s operating revenue was million higher primarily because results did not include the pipeline s revenue prior to the pipeline s january  acquisition date 
midwestern gas transmission s revenue included operational gas sales which increased its revenue million in operations and maintenance expense decreased million in compared with primarily due to the settlement or anticipated settlement of several outstanding issues related to enron which reduced expenses in  including the resolution of costs related to the termination of enron s cash balance plan of million  the settlement for certain administrative expenses for and of million and an adjustment to our allowance for doubtful accounts related to bankruptcy claims held by northern border pipeline of million 
interest expense decreased million in compared with due to northern border pipeline s lower average debt outstanding as a result of equity contributions from its general partners that were used to repay outstanding indebtedness 
natural gas gathering and processing segment income from continuing operations increased million  or  in compared with excluding the effect of impairment charges that were recorded in  primarily as a result of the following the sale of non strategic assets in the powder river basin  and estimated recoveries of bankruptcy claims against enron and enron north america 
in  we accelerated our annual impairment testing due to lower throughput volumes for the segment 
we determined that impairment existed related to our tangible assets and goodwill 
we recorded an impairment charge of million as a result  which consisted of million related to tangible assets in the powder river basin and million for goodwill related to the segment 
operating revenue increased million  nearly  in compared with due to our williston basin results 
gathering and processing volumes for our williston basin operations increased mmcf d  or  as a result of increased drilling activity due to strong commodity prices  which partially offset lower gathering volumes in the powder river basin 
we also benefited from higher prices on our natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the weighted average price of natural gas realized  net of the effects of hedging  was per mmbtu in compared with per mmbtu in the weighted average price of natural gas liquids realized  net of the effects of hedging  was per gallon in compared with per gallon in product purchases increased million  or  in compared with product purchases as a percent of operating revenue increased to of operating revenue in compared with of operating revenue in product purchases reflect the amounts we paid to producers for raw natural gas 
operations and maintenance expense decreased million  or  in compared with in  the average daily volume gathered in the powder river basin was down compared with due to well production declining more than anticipated despite modest growth in drilling activity 
we sold two non strategic gathering systems and compressor equipment in the powder river basin  resulting in a million gain which reduced operations and maintenance expense in in addition  we renegotiated certain gathering contracts to mitigate volumetric risk and reduce operations and maintenance expense 
operations and maintenance expense was also reduced due to the settlement or anticipated settlement of several outstanding issues related to enron  including a reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts of million and the resolution of costs related to the termination of enron s cash balance plan of million 
liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities and bank credit facilities 
we fund our operating expenses  debt service and cash distributions to limited and general partners primarily with operating cash flow 
capital resources for acquisitions and maintenance and growth expenditures are funded by a variety of sources  including cash generated from operating activities  borrowings under bank credit facilities  issuance of senior unsecured notes or sale of additional limited partner interests 
our ability to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on our financial condition  credit ratings and market conditions 
we believe that our ability to obtain financing at reasonable rates and our history of consistent cash flow from operating activities provide a solid foundation to meet our future liquidity and capital resource requirements 
short term liquidity we use cash from operating activities and bank credit facilities as our primary sources of short term liquidity 
in may  we entered into a million five year revolving credit agreement with certain financial institutions 
under this agreement  we borrowed million to pay the outstanding balance of our existing million revolving credit agreement and terminated that agreement 
at our option  the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings may be the lender s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread that is based on our long term unsecured debt ratings 
we are required to comply with certain financial  operational and legal covenants  including the maintenance of an ebitda net income plus minority interests in net income  interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization to interest expense ratio of greater than to and a debt to adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted for pro forma operating results of acquisitions made during the year ratio of no more than to if we consummate one or more acquisitions that exceed million in total purchase price  the allowable ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda is increased to to for two calendar quarters following the acquisition 
if we breach any of these covenants  amounts outstanding may become due and payable immediately 
also in may  northern border pipeline entered into a million five year revolving credit agreement with certain financial institutions 
under this agreement  northern border pipeline borrowed million to pay the outstanding balance on its existing million revolving credit agreement and terminated that agreement 
similar to our revolving credit agreement  northern border pipeline may select the lender s base rate or the libor plus a spread that is based on northern border pipeline s long term unsecured debt ratings as the interest rate on the loan 
northern border pipeline is required to comply with certain financial  operational and legal covenants  including the maintenance of an ebitda to interest expense ratio of greater than to and a debt to adjusted ebitda ratio of no more than to if northern border pipeline consummates one or more acquisitions that exceed million in total purchase price  the allowable ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda is increased to to for two calendar quarters following the acquisition 
if northern border pipeline breaches any of these covenants  amounts outstanding may become due and payable immediately 
the fair value of our variable rate debt is approximately the carrying value since the interest rates are periodically adjusted to reflect current market conditions 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement were million and we were in compliance with the covenants of our agreement 
the average interest rate on our debt at december   was 
at december   northern border pipeline s outstanding borrowings under its credit agreement were million and they were in compliance with the covenants of their agreement 
the average interest rate on northern border pipeline s debt at december   was 
long term financing on february   we announced a series of transactions that will involve long term financing 
information about the proposed transactions is included under executive summary of this section 
debt securities we periodically issue long term debt securities to meet our capital resource requirements 
all of our outstanding debt securities are senior unsecured notes with similar terms except for interest rates  maturity dates and prepayment premiums 
as of december   the total liability on our outstanding senior notes was  million 
our senior note issuances of million due in and million due in are borrowed at fixed interest rates of and  respectively 
the indentures of the notes do not limit the amount of unsecured debt we may incur  but they do contain material financial covenants  including restrictions on incurrence  assumption or guarantee of secured indebtedness 
the indentures also contain provisions that require us to offer to repurchase the notes at par value if either standard poor s rating services or moody s investor services rate the notes below investment grade and the investment grade rating is not reinstated for a period of days 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the notes was approximately million 
in  the interest expense related to our outstanding senior notes was million

environmental our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties  enforcement actions and remedial liabilities 
dunavan superfund site in july  the us epa notified midwestern gas transmission and several other non affiliated parties of possible liability pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and requested information related to the dunavan oil site located in oakwood  illinois 
the epa identified midwestern gas transmission as possibly transporting and disposing of used oil at the contaminated site and classified midwestern gas transmission as a de minimis party 
we believe costs related to resolving this matter will not materially impact our results of operations or financial position

forward looking statements the statements in this annual report that are not historical information  including statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations  economic performance or related assumptions  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements may include words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  should and other words and terms of similar meaning 
although we believe that our expectations regarding future events are based on reasonable assumptions  we can give no assurance that our goals will be achieved 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include the impact of unsold capacity on northern border pipeline being greater or less than expected  the ability to market pipeline capacity on favorable terms  which is affected by future demand for and prices of natural gas  competitive conditions in the overall natural gas and electricity markets  availability of supplies of canadian and us natural gas  availability of additional storage capacity  weather conditions  and competitive developments by canadian and us natural gas transmission peers  final orders by the ferc which adversely impact changes requested in northern border pipeline s november rate case  performance of contractual obligations by our customers  the ability to recover operating costs  costs of property  plant and equipment and regulatory assets in our ferc regulated rates  timely receipt of approval by the ferc for construction and operation of midwestern gas transmission s eastern extension project and required regulatory clearances  our ability to acquire all necessary rights of way and obtain agreements for interconnects in a timely manner  and our ability to promptly obtain all necessary materials and supplies required for construction  rate of development  well performance and competitive conditions near our natural gas gathering systems in the powder river and williston basins and our investments in the powder river and wind river basins  prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids  composition and quality of the natural gas we gather and process in our plants  impact on drilling and production by factors beyond our control  including the demand for natural gas and refinery grade crude oil  producers desire and ability to obtain necessary permits  reserve performance  and capacity constraints on the pipelines that transport natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids from producing areas and our facilities  efficiency of our plants in processing natural gas and extracting natural gas liquids  renewal of the coal slurry pipeline transportation contract under reasonable terms and our success in completing the necessary reconstruction of the coal slurry pipeline  impact of potential impairment charges  developments in the december   filing by enron of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code affecting our settled claims  ability to control operating costs  conditions in the capital markets and our ability to access the capital markets  risks inherent in the use of information systems in our respective businesses  implementation of new software and hardware  and the impact on the timeliness of information for financial reporting  our ability to consummate the acquisition of the oneok subsidiaries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  our ability to successfully integrate the operations of oneok with our current operations  the dilution of our current unitholders ownership interests upon issuance of units to oneok in connection with the acquisition  and acts of nature  sabotage  terrorism or other similar acts causing damage to our facilities or our suppliers or shippers facilities 
these factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward looking statements 
other factors could also have material adverse effects on our future results 
these and other risks are described in greater detail under item a  risk factors 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these factors 
other than as required under securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information  subsequent events or change in circumstances  expectations or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview our exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity prices 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions 
we are exposed to market risk due to interest rate and commodity price volatility 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we utilize financial instruments  including forwards  swaps  collars and futures to manage the risks of certain identifiable or anticipated transactions and achieve a more predictable cash flow 
our risk management function follows established policies and procedures to monitor interest rates and natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing activities to ensure our hedging activities mitigate market risks 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we record financial instruments on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities based on fair value 
we estimate the fair value of financial instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
changes in financial instruments fair value are recognized in earnings unless the instrument qualifies as a hedge under sfas no 
and meets specific hedge accounting criteria 
qualifying financial instruments gains and losses may offset the hedged items related results in earnings for a fair value hedge or be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income for a cash flow hedge 
interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
we regularly assess the impact of interest rate fluctuations on future cash flows and evaluate hedging opportunities to mitigate our interest rate risk 
fair value hedges interest rate swaps we maintain a significant portion of our debt at fixed rates to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations and utilize interest rate swap agreements to convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt to manage interest expense 
our interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges under sfas no 
because they mitigate fluctuations in the market value of the underlying fixed rate debt 
under these agreements  we pay counterparties variable interest rates based on libor and receive interest payments based on the senior notes fixed rate 
effective notional hedged fixed rate debt period covered by swap interest rate amount senior notes  fixed rate  january to march million due march senior notes  fixed rate  january to march million due march as of december   the fair value of our hedges in effect was a liability of million 
consolidated interest expense for reflected a million benefit from these swap agreements 
if interest rates hypothetically increased compared with rates in effect as of december   our annual consolidated interest expense would increase and our consolidated income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million 
cash flow hedges forward starting interest rate swaps in december  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million in anticipation of a ten year senior note issuance 
we paid million to counterparties when the swap agreements expired in late may and early june of in june  we entered into a treasury lock interest rate agreement with a total notional amount of million  which expired in july at which time we paid million to the counterparty 
as of december   there were no forward starting interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
commodity price risk our interstate natural gas pipelines generally are not exposed to commodity price risk because they do not own the natural gas they transport 
northern border pipeline and viking gas transmission own the natural gas necessary to maintain efficient pipeline operations and shippers provide the natural gas necessary to operate the compressor stations 
midwestern gas transmission collects a fixed amount of natural gas for its operations 
when the amount of natural gas utilized by midwestern gas transmission differs from the amount provided by its shippers  the pipeline must buy or sell natural gas and is exposed to commodity price risk 
bear paw energy receives a significant portion of its revenue from the sale of commodities in exchange for gathering and processing services and is exposed to market risk due to its sensitivity to natural gas and natural gas liquids prices 
to reduce our exposure to natural gas and natural gas liquids price volatility  we enter into commodity financial instruments  including price swaps and collars  which are designated as cash flow hedges 
in  we entered into a limited number of commodity financial instruments to manage our earnings on equity natural gas and natural gas liquids 
our equity volumes for were hedged as follows weighted average average hedge hedged commodity hedged volume price per unit natural gas in mmbtu d  natural gas liquids in gallons d  as of january   our projected natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes were hedged for as follows weighted projected equity average average hedge hedged commodity volume range hedged volume price per unit natural gas in mmbtu d    natural gas liquids in gallons d    our natural gas is hedged based on pricing indexes at colorado interstate gas cig and northern natural gas nng ventura 
our natural gas liquids are hedged based on pricing indexes at conway and koch west texas intermediate wti 
if the weighted average price of natural gas hypothetically decreased per mmbtu compared with the price at december   annual net income would decrease approximately million based on our projected volumes as of january  if the weighted average price of natural gas liquids hypothetically decreased per gallon compared with the price in effect as of december   annual net income would decrease approximately million based on our projected volumes as of january  additional information about our financial instruments is included in note of the consolidated financial statements
