item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which appear in item of part ii of this annual report 
overview the corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
our net income was million  an increase of from net income of million 
the increase in net income was due to strategic decisions made by the management during and  the bank s ability to maintain its net interest margin  and a focus on controlling our operating costs 
management viewed as a transition year  implementing several strategies that were expected to positively impact net income in future periods 
this was achieved in as earnings per share increased to from in and in an average annual growth rate of from to operations in were impacted by the following significant factors focus on loan growth impact on net interest margin loan growth in all market areas continued to be a primary focus  resulting in a net increase in the loan portfolio of million during management s preference towards originating adjustable  prime rate based loans during the past several years as well as during  has benefited us in the current rising interest rate environment 
continued loan growth in  coupled with the upward re pricing of the loan portfolio  resulted in an increase in interest income on loans of million on a fully taxable equivalent basis as compared with additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table following 
funding for the loan growth in was generated primarily from certificates of deposit gathered in the bank s local market areas and some expansion of our demand deposit base 
however  a large portion of the new time deposits received in were in denominations of  or more  which typically require higher interest rates than core deposits 
this reliance on higher rate time deposits and the general increase in interest rates throughout increased deposit interest expense by approximately million when compared to however  the decline in our long term borrowings due to early redemptions had a positive impact of decreasing our interest expense by million 
the combination of loan growth  the effect of rising interest rates on our assets and liabilities  and the shortened maturities of our long term debt resulted in an overall increase in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million in when compared to the overall net interest margin increased during the year from in to in the net interest margin was positively impacted by several balance sheet restructuring strategies during these included the early redemption and re issuance of junior subordinated debentures and the early redemption of million in fhlb advances  both contributing to reduced borrowing costs in during the fourth quarter of  the bank sold million in residential mortgage loans 
the proceeds from the sale were reinvested into the investment portfolio  primarily in municipal bonds  lengthening the duration of the portfolio  reducing asset sensitivity and increasing the tax equivalent yield 
early redemption of long term borrowings in december  the bank prepaid million of long term fhlb advances having a weighted average rate of  resulting in a net gain of 
million after the payment of 
million in prepayment fees 
the prepayment was funded with a million brokered certificate of deposit which will mature in april and million in short term borrowings 
the repayment of the brokered cd and daily borrowings will come from scheduled maturities in the investment portfolio having an average weighted rate of 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income in increased by million over  driven primarily by continued growth in service charge income as well as increased production in our trust and insurance lines of business 
we also recognized a gain of 
million on the prepayment of long term fhlb advances 
these increases were offset by a decline of 
million in realized gains on the sale of investment securities as compared to operating expenses in  net of the early redemption costs of 
million related to the long term borrowings  increased by in comparison to this minimal increase was due to management s close monitoring of operating costs and a decrease in professional fees related to compliance with laws and regulations such as the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition to strong operating results  the bank continued to invest in its core market areas during a new branch office was opened during the first quarter of and a temporary mobile banking unit was opened during the third quarter  both located in morgantown  west virginia 
the bank anticipates that a new banking office will replace the temporary unit late in in addition  the corporation purchased a  square foot building in oakland  maryland for million in december to house its operations center 
this space will relieve congestion in the corporation s headquarters as well as provide capacity for the bank s anticipated growth 
management estimates that the new facility will be ready for use in the fourth quarter of the corporation continued its tradition of paying dividends to shareholders during and  in fact  increased them to per share  a increase from per share in the corporation has paid quarterly cash dividends consistently since  the year in which the holding company was formed 
we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products by existing competitors and potential new entrants in its markets  changes in interest rates  and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of the our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with the specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  change in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed below in this item under the caption allowance and provision for loan losses and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
the corporation has million of core deposit intangible assets which are subject to amortization and million in goodwill primarily related to the huntington national bank branch acquisition that occurred in  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
management has concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as a result of the evaluation 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is the largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the years dollars in thousands 
interest income interest expense net interest income net interest margin net interest income increased million in when compared to  due primarily to the increase in interest income of million  offset by an increase in interest expense of million 
interest income from loans increased by million  due to the million increase in the average balance of loans in and a slight increase of basis points in the average yield on loans 
the increase in total interest expense in was due to increased interest expense on deposits of million offset by a decrease in interest expense on long term borrowings of million 
interest expense on deposits increased primarily due to a million increase in average balances and a basis point increase in the average yield on time deposits over  the decrease in interest expense on long term borrowings was primarily due to the million decrease in the average balance coupled with the basis point decrease in average yield on these borrowings 
net interest income increased million in when compared to due primarily to the increase in interest income of million  offset by a slight increase in interest expense of 
million 
interest income from loans increased by million  due to the million increase in the average loan balance in  offset by a basis point decrease in average yield on loans 
interest expense increased in compared to  due to a decrease in interest on deposits offset by increased interest expense on borrowings of million 
deposit interest declined primarily due to the basis point decrease in average yield on time deposits of less than  interest on borrowings increased due to a million increase in average balance of short term borrowings  coupled with a basis point increase in average yield on these borrowings

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased to million in  compared to million in the million decrease in the provision was due primarily to the decrease in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans to 
in from 
in and a decrease in specific allocations as compared to the decrease in specific allocations in was caused by the decline in the number of commercial loans requiring such allocations 
the provision for loan losses increased by million in when compared to due to several factors  including the increase in the loan portfolio of million during  the increase in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans to

trust department income is directly affected by the performance of the equity and bond markets  and by the amount of assets under management 
trust income has increased steadily during the past three years as a result of development efforts in this area and increases in the average market value of assets under management in the trust department  which was million  million and million for years  and  respectively 
during  the trust department experienced higher estate administration fees than normal as a result of the settlement of a large estate 
estate fees are non recurring fee income and vary from year to year 
securities gains losses are the most variable component of other operating income 
during  the bank recorded losses in the security portfolio of 
million 
net securities gains for of

million 
gains for resulted from the decision to sell certain mortgage backed securities that were exhibiting accelerated paybacks due to the historically low interest rate environment  as well as the sale of corporate and other debt securities to utilize certain capital loss carry forwards 
the gross securities losses in resulted primarily from the write down and ultimate sale of freddie mac preferred equity securities 
these preferred securities initially exhibited other than temporary impairment in  resulting in a 
million write down in that year

salaries and wages increased by million in over  and 
million in over the increase in both periods is directly related to increased staffing to support our growth objectives and increases in performance based incentives 
other expenses decreased by 
million in when compared to due to reduced professional fees associated with various compliance costs in  such as the sarbanes oxley act 
additionally  we experienced cost savings in associated with corporate restructurings that occurred during other expenses increased by million in when compared to  due to a full year of amortization expense related to the core deposit intangible

expenses related to early redemption of long term borrowings consisted of 
million and million in early payment penalties in and  respectively  and a 
million write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the early redemption of subordinated debentures in occupancy and equipment expenses increased by only 
million from to the 
million increase from to was due to a full year of operating expenses in related to the huntington national bank branch acquisition that occurred in mid  the opening of a new branch office in martinsburg  west virginia and maintenance contracts related to the bank s new bank wide security system 
applicable income taxes income tax expense amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the resulting effective tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate year to year is due primarily to corporate restructurings in february and may the other items which lowered our effective tax rates from the federal statutory rate in and were tax exempt income from securities and loans and tax exempt boli income 
these same items were offset in by the significant increase in ordinary income as compared to consolidated balance sheet review overview our total assets reached billion at december   representing an increase of million from year end the year end total asset mix shows a consistent percentage of loans as a percentage of total assets over the past three years  as illustrated below year end percentage of total assets net loans investments the year end total liability mix shows an increased reliance on deposits as a source of funding during the three year period and the reduced reliance on borrowings  as illustrated below year end percentage of total liabilities total deposits total borrowings loan portfolio through the bank and the oakfirst loan centers  we are actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in garrett  allegany  washington  and frederick counties in maryland  mineral  hardy  berkeley  monongalia counties in west virginia  and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of its loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits and the continuous monitoring and reporting of asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided an effective check and balance for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate  and to a lesser extent  by equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding an internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the caption banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december  for all periods presented 
summary of loan portfolio dollars in thousands table loans outstanding as of december commercial residential mortgage installment residential construction lease financing total loans during  gross loans increased by million  or  over this growth was focused in our commercial million and residential mortgage million loan portfolios  and remains consistent with management s objectives over the past several years 
continued efforts were made to increase the percentage of loans in the portfolio with adjustable interest rates 
at year end  adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at year end commercial loans increased in  following a increase in origination of new commercial loans remained high in  as our lenders continued to identify new customer opportunities and expand existing customer relationships in all of our market areas  while maintaining existing standards of credit worthiness 
however  new loan volume was offset by high levels of repayment  stifling growth as compared to prior years 
most new commercial loans were priced on a variable rate basis  resetting monthly  which proved to be very popular with business borrowers 
commercial loans secured by real estate were at the end of  compared to in residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  in when compared to this follows a increase in over actual residential mortgage growth in of million over was offset by million in loan sales during the fourth quarter of the loans selected for sale were identified through an extensive analysis of the mortgage portfolio and included primarily adjustable rate products that management believed presented limited opportunities for improved yields in the next few years 
proceeds from the loan sale were invested in the bank s investment portfolio  primarily in higher yielding tax exempt municipal securities 
the majority of the growth in the mortgage loan portfolio continues to be in adjustable rate mortgage products although the bank did offer fixed rate mortgages in select market areas 
fixed interest rate loans make up of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to of total loans at the end of consumer installment loans in decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease reflects management s continued shift toward more commercial loans with less emphasis on the highly competitive consumer loan market 
specifically  less focus was placed on generating new indirect auto loans during indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of installment loans  at the end of and at the end of the remaining lease financing portfolio was repaid in and we dissolved this line of business 
during  gross loans increased million over to million 
the key contributors to this strong loan growth in were commercial million and residential mortgage million loans 
the commercial portfolio grew in  following a increase in this growth was primarily attributable to additional business with existing customer relationships and a more aggressive pricing strategy  while maintaining strong credit worthiness and underwriting standards 
residential mortgage loans grew in following a increase in the growth was attributable to a combination of an aggressive marketing campaign to solicit and retain existing mortgage customers as well as the offering of a competitive adjustable rate mortgage product as an alternative to the fixed rate offerings in the market 
consumer installment loans decreased in following a increase in the decrease reflected management s desire to focus efforts on growing the more profitable commercial and mortgage portfolios a strategy that continued through the majority of the decline was in the indirect auto loan portfolio resulting from less aggressive pricing strategies

management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due

allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
we use the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan and lease losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer and residential mortgage loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency and non accruals  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by information obtained from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for those loans on the watchlist in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured  for the small business administration and farm service agency guaranteed portion of loans  or for loans that are sufficiently collateralized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
the allowance for loan losses also includes an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses decreased to million at year end  from million at year end several factors contributed to the 
million decrease in the balance of the allowance in  including a decrease in the balance of non accrued loans from million in to million in  a decrease in impaired loans from 
million in to 
million in  and a decrease in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
to  due to a decline in the amount of commercial and installment loan charge offs during at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to 
of total loans  which was four times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at year end  from million at year end several factors contributed to the 
million increase in the balance of the allowance  including an increase in the total loan portfolio of million during the year  a slight increase in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans to 
in from 
in  caused primarily by a higher level of commercial loan charge offs  offset by reduced installment loan charge offs  and a specific allocation of 
million related to three commercial loans that are on non accrual status  based on a thorough analysis of the related collateral securing these loans 
as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  the allowance for loan losses is considered adequate as of december  and table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years

changes in the allocation over time reflect changes in the composition of the loan portfolio risk profile and refinements to the methodology of determining the allowance

the significant increase in municipal bonds is part of management s strategy to generate additional tax exempt income 
total investment securities decreased by million in compared to the year end balance in this decrease was due to the proceeds of maturing investment securities being utilized to fund the growth of the corporation s loan portfolio 
the composition of the investment portfolio changed during  with almost half of the portfolio as of year end being held in us government and agency securities 
this increase in us government and agency securities is directly related to the increase in our cash management product  an overnight repurchase agreement program for business customers 
the us government and agency securities are held as collateral for this product 
at december   the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of million  which represents the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the comparable amount at december  was a net unrealized gain of 
million 
the fair value of securities available for sale decreases whenever interest rates increase and vice versa 
the impact on bond prices of rising interest rates at the end of and throughout is reflected in the unrealized net loss position of the investment portfolio at year end further increases in interest rates after december   if sustained  will adversely impact the fair value of securities available for sale in in comparison to the year end balance

the million increase in deposits in over resulted from our purchase of brokered certificates of deposit to fund our significant loan growth  as traditional deposit growth could not satisfy demand

during both and  higher rate long term borrowings were repaid early and replaced with lower cost short term borrowings 
this strategy  in conjunction with continued emphasis on increasing low cost in house deposits  has been one of the contributing factors to the increase in net interest income and net interest margin in management will continue to closely monitor interest rates within the context of its overall asset liability management process 
see the interest rate sensitivity section of this item for further discussion on this topic 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million and an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier ii capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier i ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratio for year end was 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

liquidity the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain sufficient funds to satisfy the needs of depositors and borrowers 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds and investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
at december   such liquid assets totaled million 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions  and the corporation s ability to renew maturing deposits 
the corporation s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
when appropriate  we take advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable us to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   our available borrowing capacity through the fhlb and other financial institutions was approximately million 
we actively manage our liquidity position under the direction of the asset and liability management committee of the corporation s board of directors 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by this committee under prescribed policies and procedures are intended to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands  which will include completing the renovations to the facility acquired for its operations center 
additionally  liquidity needs for future branch expansion will be evaluated as such opportunities arise 
management anticipates opening additional branches or expanding current facilities in its existing market footprint annually or bi annually for the next several years 
for information about our borrowings  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report and is incorporated herein by reference 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to service its junior subordinated debt 
the main sources of funding for the holding company include dividends from the bank and access to the capital markets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  the bank is subject to significant regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the holding company 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million 
as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the bank could have paid to the corporation without regulatory approval was million 
interest rate sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
management has not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that we become liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is liability sensitive there is a negative impact to net interest income when interest rates increase 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of the corporation s earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
further discussion of the nature of certain obligations and commitments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referenced in the table below  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report 
payments due by period contractual obligations note less than more than in millions reference total year years years years long term debt fhlb advances junior subordinated debt operating leases data processing and telecommunications services time deposits commitment expiration by period commitments note less than more than in millions reference total year years years years loan commitments letters of credit at december   our off balance sheet arrangements were limited to loan commitments and letters of credit discussed above
