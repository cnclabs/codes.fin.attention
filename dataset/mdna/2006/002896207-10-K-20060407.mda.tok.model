the company s significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following policies are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for  primarily with either cash or credit card 
catalogue and e commerce sales are recorded upon customer receipt of merchandise 
amounts relating to shipping and handling billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and the related direct shipping costs are classified as stores and distribution expense 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
the company reserves for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable 
the company s gift cards do not expire or lose value over periods of inactivity

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or market utilizing the retail method 
the retail method of inventory valuation is an averaging technique applied to different categories of inventory 
at the company  the averaging is determined at the stock keeping unit sku level by averaging all costs for each sku 
an initial markup is applied to inventory at cost in order to establish a cost to retail ratio 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the retail and cost components of inventory on hand so as to maintain the already established cost to retail relationship 
the use of the retail method and the recording of markdowns effectively values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
at the end of the first and third fiscal quarters  the company reduces inventory value by recording a markdown reserve that represents the estimated future anticipated selling price decreases necessary to sell through the current season inventory 
additionally  as part of inventory valuation  an inventory shrinkage estimate is made each period that reduces the value of inventory for lost or stolen items 
the company performs physical inventories throughout the year and adjusts the shrink reserve accordingly 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant judgments and estimates including  among others  imu  markdowns and shrinkage  which could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that this inventory valuation method is appropriate since it preserves the cost to retail relationship in ending inventory 
property and equipment depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for financial reporting purposes on a straight line basis  using service lives ranging principally from years for buildings  the lesser of years or the life of the lease for leasehold improvements and to years for other property and equipment 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortizations are removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
major remodels and improvements that extend service lives of the assets are capitalized 
long lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability is questionable 
factors used in the evaluation include  but are not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent results of operations and projected cash flows 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance with respect to applicability to the company s operations 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because management believes the full amount of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
the effective tax rate utilized by the company reflects management s judgment of the expected tax liabilities within the various taxing jurisdictions 
contingencies in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments may be required

table of contents accordingly  no compensation expense for options has been recognized because all options are granted at fair market value on the grant date 
the company recognizes compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards to associates and non associate directors 
for the disclosure requirement of sfas no 
 the company s equity compensation expense related to stock options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock option grants  which requires the company to estimate the expected term of the stock option grants and expected future stock price volatility over the term 
the company uses the vesting period of the stock option as a proxy for the term of the option 
estimates of expected future stock price volatility are based on the historic volatility of the company s stock for the period equal to the expected term of the stock option 
the company calculates the historic volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the differences in the natural logarithms of the weekly stock closing price  adjusted for dividends and stock splits 
the fair market value calculation under the black scholes valuation model is particularly sensitive to changes in the term and volatility assumptions 
increases in term or volatility will result in a higher fair market valuation of stock option grants 
assuming all other assumptions disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation  being equal  a increase in term will yield a increase in the black scholes valuation  while a increase in volatility will yield a increase in the black scholes valuation 
the company believes that changes in term and volatility will not have a material effect on the company s results since the number of stock options granted during the period was not material

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the adoption of fin did not have any effect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
impact of inflation the company s results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  the company believes that the effects of inflation  if any  on its results of operations and financial condition have been minor
