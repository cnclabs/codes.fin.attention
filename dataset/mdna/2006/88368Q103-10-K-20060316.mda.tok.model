the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview history thestreet 
com  inc collectively  with its wholly owned subsidiaries  the company was organized in june as a delaware limited liability company and converted to a delaware c corporation in may the company creates business and investment content  which it makes available through online publications  content syndication and audio and video programming 
the company receives revenue from subscriptions  advertising and sponsorship sales  syndication and radio programming 
in late  we created independent research group llc irg research 
from april to june  as a registered broker dealer and member of the national association of securities dealers  inc  irg research provided proprietary equity research and brokerage services to institutional clients and received revenue from trading commissions 
during that time  we invested heavily to expand irg research s staff and product offerings in an effort to increase its revenue 
however  in light of market forces driving industry consolidations and increased competition  in the second quarter of  we discontinued its operations rather than continue to expend resources in an increasingly challenging environment in which the profitability timetable would likely not be met 
the discontinuation resulted in the termination of approximately employees and various contracts  including a lease for office space 
in the second quarter of  in connection with the discontinuation  we incurred a one time balance sheet write off of approximately  and a one time charge relating to future cash expenditures of approximately million 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
current state of the company the company s total net revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately to approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the company s net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased approximately to approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  with respect to overall expenses over the periods  revenue sharing agreements  fees paid to outside contributors  legal fees  overall compensation and related costs and consulting expenses increased  while online marketing expenditures decreased 
as a result  total operating expenses increased by approximately  to approximately million  for the recent year  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
subscription revenue 
subscription revenue  the largest component of net revenue  increased by approximately to approximately million  for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to subscription revenue growth for several services  primarily in the second half of the year  when the company experienced strong growth in both page views and unique visitors 
we believe this growth is due largely to our success in i signing and implementing agreements with large  high traffic portal companies to direct users to our web sites  ii promoting our brands  products and services through television and radio programs hosted by contributor james j 
cramer  and iii publishing proprietary  paid content on our free  flagship web site to help generate interest in our subscription based services 
these and other efforts  we believe  helped the company to grow its base of paying subscribers by approximately  during the year ended december  in order to take advantage of these trends  in january  the company entered into an agreement with cbs radio  inc to broadcast its radio program  realmoney with jim cramer  in major markets not accessible with our previous broadcast partner 
the company plans in to increase use of its online  direct response marketing program to promote its services and to continue to expand its use of co marketing and other distribution arrangements that do not require up front customer acquisition expenditures 
as a result  we expect the company s sales and marketing expenditures for to increase from levels 
because the company s online advertising contracts generally have the short terms and early cancellation provisions typical of the industry  the company is able to adjust its expenditures on a weekly or monthly basis  depending on the return on investment of the campaigns 
advertising revenue 
advertising revenue increased by approximately for the year ended december   to approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable primarily to strong growth in the number of unique visitors to the company s web sites and the addition of content to the company s free  flagship web site  both of which helped to increase the number of page views generated by the company s web sites 
the continued strength of the online advertising market also contributed to the increase 
these factors in turn led to an increase in the number of advertisers choosing to place their advertisements in the company s publications  which allowed the company to charge higher advertising rates 
the company plans to continue to add content including video  audio  web logs  or blogs  and non financial content to its free  flagship web site in an effort to increase page views and attract more advertisers from outside the financial industry  and expand its advertising sales staff to take advantage of the current positive trends in the online advertising market 
we also anticipate that  due to these trends  the proportion of the company s total revenue that comes from advertising is likely to increase in the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
see liquidity and capital resources 
recent events on february   the company announced that its board of directors had decided to discontinue the strategic alternative review process it began in october with the engagement of allen company llc 
on february   the company announced that its board of directors had declared the company s first quarterly cash dividend on its common stock 
the cash dividend of per share of common stock will be payable on march  to all stockholders of record at the close of business on march  the company anticipates paying regular quarterly dividends on its common stock going forward 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions  specifically for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the useful lives of fixed assets  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  as well as accrued expense estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates its revenue primarily from subscriptions and advertising 
subscription revenue represents fees paid by customers for access to particular services for the term of the subscription 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are charged directly to companies that subscribe to the service 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
the company calculates net subscription revenue by deducting actual refunds from cancelled subscriptions and chargebacks of disputed credit card charges from gross revenue 
net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods 
deferred revenue relates to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized 
advertising revenue is derived from the sale of internet sponsorship arrangements and from the delivery of banner and email advertisements on the company s web sites  and is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
although infrequent  company obligations could include guarantees of a minimum number of times that users of the company s web sites click through to the advertisers web site  or take additional specified action  such as opening an account 
in such cases  revenue is recognized as the guaranteed click throughs or other relevant delivery criteria are fulfilled 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to the company s nationally syndicated daily radio program  realmoney with jim cramer  and syndication revenue 
revenue for the radio program is recognized ratably as the program is broadcast 
syndication revenue is recognized ratably over the period the service is provided to the syndication partner 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its advertisers to make required payments and for paid subscriptions that are cancelled and refunded or charged back by the subscriber 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
although results of prior estimates have been in line with management s expectations  should the financial condition of the company s advertisers and subscribers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets three years for computer equipment  including capitalized software and web site development costs  and five years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the respective lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  the company stopped the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  and completed the required transitional fair value impairment test on its goodwill and certain other intangible assets  the results of which had no impact on the company s financial statements 
based upon annual impairment tests as of september   and  no impairment was indicated for the company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
business concentrations and credit risk financial instruments that subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and accounts receivable 
the company maintains all its cash and cash equivalents in five financial institutions 
the company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions 
the company s customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations  generally does not require collateral  and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information 
to date  actual losses have been within management s expectations 
stock based compensation as of october   the company elected early adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements and this statement requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based upon estimated fair values

stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r for the three months ended december  was  the impact of stock based compensation expense has been significant to reported and pro forma results of operations and per share amounts see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of each option grant has been estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model and includes several assumptions  including the risk free interest rate and the expected volatility of the company s common stock price 
for each increase in the risk free interest rate used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated impact to the company s total operating expense and total pro forma expense for the year ended december  would increase by approximately  and  respectively 
for each increase in the expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model  the resulting estimated impact to the company s total operating expense and total pro forma expense for the year ended december  would increase by approximately  and  respectively 
because options are expensed over up to four years from the date of grant  the foregoing estimated increases include potential expense for options granted during the years ended december     and in calculating the amount of each variable that is included in the black scholes options pricing model ie  option exercise price  stock price  option term  risk free interest rate  annual dividend rate  and volatility  we used the weighted average of such variable for all grants issued in a given year 
income taxes the company accounts for its income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that the tax change occurs 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

on june   the company and its individual defendants together with the company s insurance carriers entered into a settlement with the plaintiffs 
the settlement is subject to a hearing on fairness and approval by the court overseeing the litigation 
although the lawsuit against the company is an independent cause of action vis a vis the lawsuits pending against other issuers in the consolidated proceeding  and no issuer is liable for any wrongdoing allegedly committed by any other issuer  the proposed settlement between the plaintiffs and the issuers is being done on a collective basis 
generally  under the terms of the settlement  in exchange for the delivery by the insurers of the company and the other defendants of an undertaking guaranteeing that the plaintiffs will recover  in the aggregate  billion from the underwriters  and the assignment to the plaintiffs by the issuers of their interests in claims against the underwriters for excess compensation in connection with their ipos  the plaintiffs will release the non bankrupt issuers from all claims against them the bankrupt issuers will receive a covenant not to sue and their individual defendants
