table of contents proved reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or conclusive formation test 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas oil and or oil water contacts  if any  and ii the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled  but which can be reasonably judged as economically productive on the basis of available geological and engineering data 
in the absence of information on fluid contacts  the lowest known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower proved limit of the reservoir 
reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when successful testing by a pilot project  or the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  provides support for the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based 
estimates of proved reserves do not include i oil that may become available from known reservoirs but is classified separately as indicated additional reserves  ii oil  gas  and natural gas liquids  the recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because of uncertainty as to geology  reservoir characteristics  or economic factors  iii oil  gas  and natural gas liquids  that may occur in undrilled prospects  and iv oil  gas  and natural gas liquids  that may be recovered from oil shales  coal  gilsonite and other such sources 
proved developed reserves 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
proved reserve additions 
the sum of additions to proved reserves from extensions  discoveries  improved recovery  acquisitions and revisions of previous estimates 
reserve additions 
changes in proved reserves due to revisions of previous estimates  extensions  discoveries  improved recovery and other additions and purchases of reserves in place 
reserve life 
a measure of the productive life of an oil and gas property or a group of properties  expressed in years 
reserve life is calculated by dividing proved reserve volumes at year end by production volumes 

table of contents royalty 
an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage or of the proceeds of the sale thereof  but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage 
royalties may be either landowner s royalties  which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted  or overriding royalties  which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner 
standardized measure 
the present value  discounted at per year  of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved reserves  computed by applying sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and held constant throughout the productive life of the reserves except for consideration of price changes to the extent provided by contractual arrangements  and deducting the estimated future costs to be incurred in developing  producing and abandoning the proved reserves computed based on current costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
future income taxes are calculated by applying the statutory federal and state income tax rate to pre tax future net cash flows  net of the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to oil and gas operations 
upstream 
the portion of the oil and gas industry focused on acquiring  exploiting  developing  exploring for and producing oil and gas 
working interest 
an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations

table of contents part i items and business and properties general we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the activities of acquiring  developing  exploiting  exploring and producing oil and gas properties in the united states 
we own oil and gas properties in six states with principal operations in the los angeles and san joaquin basins onshore california  the santa maria basin offshore california  the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana  including the gulf of mexico  and the val verde portion of the greater permian basin in texas 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development and exploitation opportunities as well as newer properties with development  exploitation and exploration potential 
we use derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
oil and gas reserves as of december  we had estimated proved reserves of mmboe  of which was comprised of oil and was proved developed 
we have a total proved reserve life of over years and a proved developed reserve life of over years 
we believe our long lived  low production decline reserve base combined with our active hedging strategy should provide us with relatively stable and recurring cash flow 
as of december  and based on year end spot market prices of per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas  as adjusted for area and quality differentials  our reserves had a standardized measure of billion 
the following table sets forth information with respect to our oil and gas properties as of and for the year ended december  dollars in millions california other total proved reserves mmboe percent oil proved developed reserves mmboe production mmboe standardized measure estimated future income taxes are calculated on a combined basis using the statutory income tax rate  accordingly  the standardized measure is presented in total only 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our reserves based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum consulting firms of netherland  sewell associates  inc in and and netherland  sewell associates  inc and ryder scott company in the reserve volumes and values were determined under the method prescribed by the sec  which requires the application of year end prices for each year  held constant throughout the projected reserve life 
as of december  dollars in thousands oil and gas reserves oil mbbls proved developed proved undeveloped gas mmcf proved developed proved undeveloped mboe standardized measure average year end realized prices oil per bbl gas per mcf year end spot market prices oil per bbl gas per mcf reserve life years our year end standardized measure includes future development costs related to proved undeveloped reserves of million in  million in and million in based on prices in effect at year end with adjustments based on location and quality 
the market price for california crude oil differs from the established market indices due primarily to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
at the end of the basis differentials for california crude oil had widened significantly and the difference between the year end spot market price and our average year end realized price for was significantly greater than in other periods 
a measure of the productive life of an oil and gas property or a group of properties  expressed in years 
reserve life is calculated by dividing proved reserve volumes at year end by production volumes 
production volumes are based on annualized fourth quarter production and are adjusted  if necessary  to reflect property acquisitions and dispositions 
during the three year period ended december  we participated in exploratory wells  of which were successful  and development wells  of which were successful 
during this period  we incurred aggregate oil and gas acquisition  exploitation  development and exploration costs of billion  approximately of which was for acquisition  exploitation and development activities 
during this period proved reserve additions totaled mmboe 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves  and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
many of the 
table of contents factors that impact these estimates are beyond our control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
in addition  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities and cash flows based upon the same available data 
therefore  the standardized measure shown above represents estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with sec guidelines  the reserve engineers estimates of future net revenues from our properties  and the present value of the properties  are made using oil and gas sales prices in effect as of the dates of such estimates and are held constant throughout the life of the properties  except where the guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations but excluding the effect of any hedges we have in place 
historically  the prices for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
since december  we have not filed any estimates of total net proved oil or gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the sec 
acquisitions we intend to be opportunistic in pursuing selective acquisitions of oil or gas properties or exploration projects 
we will consider opportunities located in our current core areas of operation as well as projects in other areas that meet our investment criteria 
property acquisitions in april we acquired certain california producing oil and gas properties  primarily located in the los angeles basin of onshore california with some smaller properties located in adjacent ventura county  from a private company for million 
in september we acquired an additional interest in the point arguello unit  rocky point development project and related facilities  offshore california  from subsidiaries of chevron usa inc this acquisition increased our working interest in that operation to 
acquisition of nuevo energy company in may we acquired nuevo energy company nuevo in a stock for stock transaction 
in the acquisition  each outstanding share of nuevo common stock was converted into shares of pxp common stock and nuevo became our wholly owned subsidiary 
at the closing of this transaction we issued million additional pxp common shares and assumed million in net debt and million of term convertible securities  series a  or tecons 
prior to the acquisition  nuevo was engaged in the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing and producing oil and gas primarily onshore and offshore california and in west texas 
we accounted for the transaction as a purchase under purchase accounting rules effective may  acquisition of tec energy corporation in june  we acquired tec energy corporation tec for approximately million in cash and common stock plus million to retire tec s outstanding debt 
prior to the acquisition  
table of contents tec was engaged in the upstream activities of acquiring  exploiting  developing and producing oil and gas in east texas and the gulf coast region  both onshore and in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
we accounted for the transaction as a purchase under purchase accounting rules effective june  exploitation  development and exploration we expect to continue our reserve and production growth through the exploitation and development of our existing inventory of projects in each of our primary operating areas 
to complement the exploitation and development activities  we expect to continue to expand on our success in exploratory drilling by taking advantage of our exploratory projects in south louisiana  texas and the gulf of mexico 
to implement the plans  we will focus on allocating investment capital prudently after rigorous evaluation  optimizing production practices  realigning and expanding injection processes  performing stimulations  recompletions  artificial lift upgrades and other operating margin and reserve enhancements  focusing geophysical and geological talent  employing modern seismic applications  establishing land and prospect inventory practices to reduce costs  and using new technology applications in drilling and completion practices 
by implementing our exploitation  development and exploration plan  we seek to increase cash flows and enhance the value of our asset base 
in doing so  we add to and enhance our proved reserves 
during the three year period ended december  our additions to proved reserves  excluding reserves added as a result of acquisition activities  totaled mmboe 
during this period we incurred aggregate oil and gas exploitation  development and exploration costs of million 
the company has a million capital budget for approximately to of the capital budget is allocated to the development of existing proved reserves 
spending on exploitation projects is expected to be about  with exploration spending  primarily in the deep water gulf of mexico middle and lower miocene trend  accounting for the remainder of the capital budget 
the capital budget includes estimated capitalized general and administrative and interest expense of approximately million 
approximately to of the budget is expected to be spent on california onshore projects and to is expected to be spent offshore california 
approximately to is expected to be spent in the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana and includes expected participation in new prospect areas in the gulf of mexico 
the remainder of the budget is expected to be spent in the permian basin in west texas 
description of properties los angeles and san joaquin basins in california la basin we essentially hold a working interest in most of our la basin properties  including interests in the montebello  inglewood  inglewood satellite  las cienegas  sansinena and other smaller la 
table of contents basin fields  and operate producing and waterflood injection wells in the fields 
the la basin properties are characterized by lighter crude to degree api  wells from  feet to over  feet at our deep inglewood project and include both primary production and waterfloods 
in april we purchased certain la basin assets that were producing approximately mboe per day at acquisition 
the properties included proved undeveloped drilling locations and wells targeted for workover  of which were initiated in in we spent million on capital projects in the la basin 
the inglewood field accounted for million or of the capital associated with la basin projects 
our net average daily production from our la basin properties in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
during the first three quarters of we completed wells at inglewood in the shallow vickers rindge waterflood interval and in the deeper sentous and moynier intervals 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated an aggressive development program and completed wells with an additional wells in progress at year end 
an additional wells are budgeted in this program is an acceleration of our historical shallow development program as well as the initiation of a deeper waterflood program 
in we will also begin development drilling on some of the properties that were purchased in early san joaquin basin we hold interests in the cymric  midway sunset  south belridge  buena vista hills and various other fields in the san joaquin basin 
our san joaquin properties are generally characterized by heavier oil to degree api  and shallow wells generally less than  feet that require cyclic or continuous thermal stimulation 
these properties also produce lesser amounts of lighter oil and natural gas under primary recovery 
in  we spent million on capital projects in the san joaquin basin and drilled wells 
in the south belridge field we spent million and drilled wells  in the cymric field we spent million and drilled wells  in the midway sunset field we spent million and drilled wells and in the other fields we spent million and drilled wells 
our net average daily production from our san joaquin basin properties in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
san joaquin drilling in will encompass both development of existing tertiary recovery steamfloods as well as expansion and initial development of new primary recovery and steamflood projects 
the development will largely be focused in the midway sunset  cymric and mount poso fields 
other onshore california we hold a working interest net revenue interest in the arroyo grande field located in san luis obispo county  california 
the field is primarily under continuous steam injection 
we have drilled wells to downsize the injection patterns in the currently developed area from five acres to one and a quarter acres to accelerate recoveries  and realigned steam injection within these areas to increase the efficiency of the recovery process 
in we began planning and feasibility engineering for the installation of a reverse osmosis water treatment plant and water out take facilities needed to remove water from the producing reservoir and increase operating efficiency 
during  an initial environmental study was completed  preliminary engineering for various water out take options was completed  and phase i of a pilot plant study was successfully completed 
phase ii of the pilot plant study will be conducted in along with submittal of permit applications to the various regulatory agencies 

table of contents during we will continue with an active program of side track drilling existing wells  converting existing wells to steam injection  and recompleting wells to open additional pay intervals 
accelerated drilling of new wells is anticipated in in the fourth quarter of our net production from the field averaged mboe per day 
santa maria basin offshore california point arguello unit p e we are the operator and hold working interests in the point arguello unit and the various partnerships owning the related transportation  processing and marketing infrastructure 
we are also the operator of federal offshore lease p and have agreements in place between the p owners and the point arguello unit owners that will allow us to participate with at least a working interest in the development of the east half of the p lease 
the companies from which we purchased our interests in the point arguello unit retained responsibility for the majority of the abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms  removing and disposing of all existing pipelines  and removing  dismantling  disposing and remediating all existing onshore facilities 
we are responsible for our share of other abandonment costs which primarily consist of well bore abandonment s and conductor removals 
in october  we successfully completed the initial development well  the c  into the p e field also known as the rocky point structure 
the well had an initial production rate of in excess of mboe per day gross 
subsequent to the initial well two additional wells  the c and c  were drilled  neither of which achieved expected results 
we successfully re drilled the c well and completed it at an initial rate of mboe per day gross in november following the success of this redrill we solicited and received approval from our partners to re drill the c to better geological objectives as revealed by the c and confirmed by the c redrill 
the c was completed in february at an initial rate of mboe per day gross 
based on the results of these two side track near horizontal wells  a new well  the c  will be drilled with operations currently underway 
further rocky point drilling beyond the c well is not presently anticipated  however  opportunities for additional drilling in the main point arguello field are under review 
in  we spent million on point arguello unit p e capital projects and our net average daily oil production in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
point pedernales 
we hold a working interest in the offshore pt 
pedernales field which includes one platform and support facilities which lie within the onshore lompoc field 
the offshore pt 
pedernales field utilizes one platform to exploit the federal ocs monterey reservoir utilizing extended reach directional wells 
in we spent million on capital projects in this field 
our combined net average daily production from our pt 
pedernales field and lompoc field in the fourth quarter of was mboe per day 
our drilling program includes four infill development wells in the point pedernales field 
efforts are also underway to obtain the necessary permits and leasehold rights to allow us to exploit the offsetting tranquillon ridge monterey structure  utilizing directional wells drilled from the existing platform to a reservoir within the three mile state water jurisdictional limit 
we currently have one extended reach directional well drilled into and producing from the portion of the tranquillon structure that extends beyond the three mile limit into federal waters 
gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana in  we spent million on exploration and development projects in the gulf coast basin 
we participated in a total of wells  four of which were successful and three of which were in 
table of contents progress at year end 
in the breton sound extension area  which is located east southeast of new orleans  we spent million and drilled three exploratory wells  two of which were successful 
our net average production for this area was mboe per day in the fourth quarter of in our gulf coast basin projects will be primarily gas focused 
in the breton sound area we expect to drill four to six exploitation wells  including wells delayed from due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
in the deep water gulf of mexico we expect to participate in four to eight wells 
in january chevron corporation announced a deepwater oil discovery at the big foot prospect in walker ridge block  approximately miles south of new orleans 
the big foot discovery well is located in approximately  feet of water and was drilled to a total depth of  feet 
further appraisal drilling will be required to determine the commercial potential of the discovery 
we own a working interest in the big foot prospect 
permian basin in west texas we are the operator with working interests ranging from to in the pakenham field in west texas which currently has producing gas wells 
the field is located in terrell county  texas within the overall permian basin complex of west texas on the southern margin of the val verde basin 
in we spent million on capital projects that included both drilling and recompletion opportunities 
production from the field averaged mboe per day in the fourth quarter of in we will continue low risk development drilling and recompletions 
texas exploration in we will participate in some higher risk prospects in texas  targeting significant gas potential 
we anticipate to wells will be drilled on a series of prospects that were acquired in wyoming we anticipate securing the required permits to allow drilling in  dependent on permit timing and seasonal considerations  on a gas prospect in wyoming s green river basin that was acquired during property divestments we periodically evaluate and from time to time have elected to sell certain of our mature producing properties that we consider to be nonstrategic 
such sales enable us to focus on our core properties  maintain financial flexibility and redeploy the proceeds therefrom to activities that we believe potentially have a higher financial return 
in may we closed the sale to xto energy  inc of interests in producing properties located in east texas and oklahoma for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were primarily used to fund the transactions to eliminate all of our oil price swaps and collars as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations derivative instruments and hedging 
in december  we completed the sale of certain properties located offshore california and onshore south texas  new mexico  and south louisiana 
these unrelated transactions included the divestment of platforms in federal and state waters off the coast of california and three related onshore facilities and essentially all our remaining assets in south texas and new mexico 
these divestments were conducted via negotiated and auction transactions 
in aggregate  we received net proceeds of approximately million from these transactions 
we retained certain abandonment obligations in connection with the offshore california properties

historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including location and quality differentials  seasonality  economic conditions  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing and gas producing countries  the actions of opec  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had  and could have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value and volumes of our proved reserves and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 

table of contents we use various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risks 
the derivatives provide us protection on the volumes if prices decline below the prices at which the derivatives are set 
however  ceiling prices in our derivatives may cause us to receive less revenue on the volumes than we would receive in the absence of the derivatives 
a substantial portion of our oil and gas reserves are located in california and approximately of our production is attributable to heavy crude generally degree api gravity crude oil or lower 
the market price for california crude oil differs from the established market indices in the us  due principally to the higher transportation and refining costs associated with heavy oil 
our heavy crude is primarily sold to conocophillips under a year contract which expires on december  this contract provides for pricing based on a percentage of the nymex crude oil price for each type of crude oil that we produce and deliver to conocophillips in california 
this percentage may be renegotiated every two years  with the current percentage rates eligible for renegotiation effective at the end of we are currently receiving approximately of the nymex index price for crude oil sold under the conocophillips contract  representing approximately of our total crude oil production 
approximately of our crude oil production is sold through plains all american pipeline  lp paa with sold under contracts that provide for nymex less a fixed price differential currently averaging nymex less and the remainder sold under contracts that provide for monthly field posted prices 
these contracts expire at various times in through the marketing agreement with paa provides that paa will purchase for resale at market prices certain of our oil production for which paa charges a marketing fee of either or per barrel based upon the contract the barrels are resold under 
prices received for our gas are subject to seasonal variations and other fluctuations 
approximately of our gas production is sold monthly based on industry recognized  published index pricing 
the remainder is priced daily on the spot market 
fluctuations between the two pricing mechanisms can significantly impact the overall differential to the henry hub 
during  and sales to paa accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues and during and sales to conocophillips accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during such periods no other purchaser accounted for more than of our total revenues 
the loss of any single significant customer or contract could have a material adverse short term effect  however  we do not believe that the loss of any single significant customer or contract would materially affect our business in the long term 
we believe such purchasers could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
however  their role as the purchaser of a significant portion of our oil production does have the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that they may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary decreases in a significant portion of our oil and gas production

under the terms of the agreements cook hill properties will be responsible for creating a development plan and obtaining all necessary permits for real estate development in an environmentally responsible manner on the surface estates of our holdings at our montebello property in los angeles county  our lompoc property in santa barbara county and our arroyo grande property in san luis obispo county 
cook hill properties is a participant in the venture and can earn an additional incentive on each property 
in the course of our business  certain of our properties may be subject to easements or other incidental property rights and legal requirements that may affect the use and enjoyment of our property 
title to properties our properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions 
we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business 
we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties 
we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets 
although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business 
competition our competitors include major integrated oil and gas companies and numerous independent oil and gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of our larger competitors possess and employ financial and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
these competitors are able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  there is substantial competition for prospects and resources in the oil and gas industry 
regulation our operations are subject to extensive regulations 
many federal  state and local departments and agencies are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  laws and regulations binding on the 
table of contents oil and gas industry and its individual participants 
the failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
however  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors 
due to the myriad complex federal  state and local regulations that may affect us directly or indirectly  you should not rely on the following discussion of certain laws and regulations as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our operations 
osha 
we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  or osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the united states environmental protection agency community right to know regulations  and similar state statutes require that we maintain certain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to our employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances

the mms has broad authority to regulate our oil and gas operations on offshore leases in federal waters 
it must approve and grant permits in connection with our drilling and development plans 
additionally  the mms has promulgated regulations requiring offshore production facilities to meet stringent engineering and construction specifications restricting the flaring or venting of gas  governing the plugging and abandonment of wells and controlling the removal of production facilities 
under certain circumstances  the mms may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases  as discussed in risk factors governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  might impose regulations that increase our costs and may terminate or suspend our operations 
the mms has proposed regulations that would permit it to expel unsafe operators from offshore operations 
the mms has also established rules governing the calculation of royalties and the valuation of oil produced from federal offshore leases and regulations regarding costs for gas transportation 
delays in the approval of plans and issuance of permits by the mms because of staffing  economic  environmental or other reasons could adversely affect our operations 
regulation of production 
oil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
state and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the regulation of the spacing  plugging and abandonment of wells 
many states also restrict production to the market demand for oil and gas  and several states have indicated interest in revising applicable regulations 
these regulations limit the amount of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
also  each state generally imposes an ad valorem  production or severance tax with respect to production and sale of oil  gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
pipeline regulation 
we have pipelines to deliver our production to sales points 
our pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement  and management of pipeline facilities 
in addition  we must permit access to and copying of records  and must make certain reports and provide information  as required by the secretary of transportation 
the states in which we have pipelines have comparable regulations 
some of our pipelines related to the point arguello unit are also subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements 

table of contents sale of gas 
the ferc regulates interstate gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions 
although the ferc does not regulate gas producers such as us  the agency s actions are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the gas industry 
to date  the ferc s pro competition policies have not materially affected our business or operations 
it is unclear what impact  if any  future rules or increased competition within the gas industry will have on our gas sales efforts 
the ferc  the united states congress or state regulatory agencies may consider additional proposals or proceedings that might affect the gas industry 
we cannot predict when or if these proposals will become effective or any effect they may have on our operations 
we do not believe  however  that any of these proposals will affect us any differently than other gas producers with which we compete 
environmental 
our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to safety  health and environmental protection  including the generation  storage  handling  emission and transportation of materials and the discharge of materials into the environment 
other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include  but are not necessarily limited to  the marine mammal protection act  the marine protection  the research and sanctuaries act  the endangered species act  the fish and wildlife coordination act  the fishery conservation and management act  the migratory bird treaty act and the national historic preservation act 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and for certain other activities  limit or prohibit construction  drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
as with our industry generally  our compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain  upgrade and close equipment and facilities 
although these regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position because our competitors that comply with such laws and regulations are similarly affected 
environmental laws and regulations have historically been subject to change  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on our operations 
if a person violates these environmental laws and regulations and any related permits  they may be subject to significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
if we were to discharge hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment  we could  to the extent the event is not insured  incur substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage 
permits 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding and insurance requirements to drill  operate  plug and abandon  and restore the surface associated with our wells  and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandonment of wells  the disposal of fluids and solids used in connection with our operations and air emissions associated with our operations 
also  we have permits from the city and county of los angeles  california  the city of culver city  california  the city of la habra heights  california  the city of commerce  california  the county of kern  california  the county of ventura  california  the city of montebello  california  the city of beverly hills  california and the county of santa barbara  california to operate crude oil  natural gas and related pipelines and equipment that run within the boundaries of these governmental entities 
the permits required for various aspects of our operations are subject to revocation  modification and renewal by issuing authorities 

table of contents plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we receive an indemnity with respect to those costs 
although we obtained environmental studies on our properties in california and we believe that such properties have been operated in accordance with standard oil field practices  certain of the fields have been in operation for over years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to comply with such rules and regulations 
in connection with the purchase of certain of our onshore california properties  we received a limited indemnity for certain conditions if they violate applicable local  state and federal environmental laws and regulations in effect on the date of such agreement 
we believe that we do not have any material obligations for operations conducted prior to our acquisition of these properties  other than our obligation to plug existing wells and those normally associated with customary oil field operations of similarly situated properties 
current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations may require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations  and there can be no assurance that any portion of such amounts will be recoverable under the indemnity 
we estimate our cash expenditures related to plugging  abandonment and remediation will be approximately million 
due to the long life of our onshore california reserve base we do not expect our cash outlays for such expenditures for these properties will increase significantly in the next several years 
although our offshore california properties have a shorter reserve life  third parties have retained the majority of the obligations for abandoning these properties 
in connection with the sale of certain properties offshore california in december we retained the responsibility for certain abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms 
the present value of such abandonment costs  million million undiscounted  are included in our asset retirement obligation as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we agreed to guarantee the performance of the purchaser with respect to the remaining abandonment obligations related to the properties approximately million 
the fair value of our obligation  million  is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
employees as of january  we had full time employees  of whom were field personnel involved in oil and gas producing activities 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock or debt securities 
volatile oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our success is largely dependent on oil and gas prices  which are extremely volatile 
any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and gas below current levels will have a negative impact on our business operations and future revenues 
moreover  oil and gas prices depend on factors we cannot control  such as supply and demand for oil and gas and expectations regarding supply and demand  weather  actions by the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  political conditions in other oil producing and gas producing countries including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas  the prices of foreign exports and the availability of alternate fuel sources  general economic conditions in the united states and worldwide  and governmental regulations 
with respect to our business  prices of oil and gas will affect our revenues  cash flows  profitability and earnings  our ability to attract capital to finance our operations and the cost of such capital  the amount that we are allowed to borrow  and the value of our oil and gas properties and our oil and gas reserve volumes 
estimates of oil and gas reserves depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies could adversely affect the quantity and value of our oil and gas reserves 
the proved oil and gas reserve information included in this document represents only estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimates were calculated using oil and gas prices in effect on the dates indicated in the reports 
any significant price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our reserves 
petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other comparable producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and gas prices  and 
table of contents assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered  the timing of the recovery of oil and gas reserves  the production and operating costs incurred  and the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will vary from estimates and the variances may be material 
the discounted future net revenues included in this document should not be considered as the market value of the reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net revenues will also be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which the sec requires to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on the cost of capital in effect from time to time and risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general 
if we are unable to replace the reserves that we have produced  our reserves and revenues will decline 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop and acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable which  in itself  is dependent on oil and gas prices 
without continued successful exploitation  acquisition or exploration activities  our reserves and revenues will decline as a result of our current reserves being depleted by production 
we may not be able to find or acquire additional reserves at acceptable costs 
the geographic concentration and lack of marketable characteristics of our oil reserves may have a greater effect on our ability to sell our oil compared to other companies 
a substantial portion of our oil and gas reserves are located in california 
because our reserves are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors  our business is subject to local conditions more than other  more diversified companies 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  natural disasters  and restrictive regulations  that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
our california oil production is heavier than premium grade light oil 
due to the processes required to refine this type of oil and the transportation requirements  it is difficult to market california oil 
table of contents production outside california 
additionally  the margin sales price minus production costs on heavy oil sales is generally less than that of lighter oil due to price differentials  and the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter grades of oil 
we intend to continue to enter into derivative contracts for a portion of our crude oil production  which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and which may cause volatility in our reported earnings 
we use derivative instruments to manage our commodity price risk 
this practice may prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the derivative agreement 
the level of derivative activity depends on our view of market conditions  available derivative prices and our operating strategy 
for  our crude oil derivative position consists exclusively of purchased put option contracts with a strike price of on  barrels per day 
the only cash settlements we are required to make on these contracts are option premiums  which are expected to total approximately million per month 
in return  to the extent the daily average nymex price for west texas intermediate crude oil is less than  we will receive the difference between and the daily average nymex price for west texas intermediate crude oil 
our crude oil derivative position also includes purchased put option contracts with a strike price of on  barrels per day in and crude oil price collars on  barrels per day with a floor of and an average ceiling of in and in a typical collar transaction  we have the right to receive from the counterparty the excess of the floor price specified in the derivative agreement over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the specified quantity 
if the floating price exceeds the floor price and is less than the ceiling price  no payment is required by either party 
if the floating price exceeds the ceiling price  we must pay the counterparty this difference multiplied by the specified quantity 
if we have less production than we have specified under the collars when the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we must make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
if these payments become too large  the remainder of our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  our derivative agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty defaults on its contract obligations 
see item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks for a summary of our current derivative positions 
since all of such derivative contracts are accounted for under mark to market accounting we expect continued volatility in our reported earnings due to gains and losses on these contracts as changes occur in the nymex price indexes 
our offshore operations are subject to substantial regulations and risks  which could adversely affect our ability to operate and our financial results 
we conduct operations offshore california and louisiana 
our offshore activities are subject to more extensive governmental regulation than our other oil and gas activities 
in addition  we are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating offshore  including risks relating to hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  oil field service costs and availability  compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations  remediation and other costs resulting from oil spill releases of hazardous materials and other environmental damages  and failure of equipment or facilities 

table of contents the majority of our oil production in california is dedicated to two customers and as a result  our credit exposure to those customers is significant 
we have entered into oil marketing arrangements with paa and with conocophillips under which paa or conocophillips purchase the majority of our net oil production in california 
we generally do not require letters of credit or other collateral from paa or from conocophillips to support these trade receivables 
accordingly  a material adverse change in paa s or conocophillips s financial condition could adversely impact our ability to collect the applicable receivables  and thereby affect our financial condition 
operating hazards  natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities  which may not be fully covered by our insurance 
the oil and gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  gas or well fluids  fires  pollution  and releases of toxic gas 
in addition  our operations in california are susceptible to damage from natural disasters such as earthquakes  mudslides and fires and our gulf of mexico operations are susceptible to hurricanes 
any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries  fatalities  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages  or property damage  which could expose us to liabilities 
the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce  or even eliminate  the funds available for exploration  development  and acquisition  or could result in a loss of our properties 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities 
the insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years 
as a result  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability  especially environmental liability  is currently available at reasonable cost 
if we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  then our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may not be successful in acquiring  exploiting  developing or exploring for oil and gas properties 
the successful acquisition  exploitation or development of  or exploration for  oil and gas properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and gas prices and operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities  and other factors 
these assessments are necessarily inexact 
as a result  we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property  or may not recognize an acceptable return from properties we do acquire 
in addition  our exploitation and development and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves 
our operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of inadequate capital or other factors  such as title problems  
table of contents weather  compliance with governmental regulations or price controls  mechanical difficulties  or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment 
in addition  exploitation and development costs may greatly exceed initial estimates 
in that case  we would be required to make unanticipated expenditures of additional funds to develop these projects  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  exploration for oil and gas  particularly offshore  has inherent and historically higher risk than exploitation and development activities 
future reserve increases and production may be dependent on our success in our exploration efforts  which may be unsuccessful 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for oil and gas  or distribution problems in meeting this demand  could adversely affect our business 
our success is materially dependent upon the demand for oil and gas 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the demand for and supply of oil and gas  the availability of alternative energy sources  the proximity of reserves to  and the capacity of  oil and gas gathering systems  pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
we may also have to shut in some of our wells temporarily due to a lack of market or adverse weather conditions including hurricanes 
if the demand for oil and gas diminishes  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in addition  there are limitations related to the methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production  any of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our operations 
successfully implementing our strategies will depend  in part  on our management team 
the loss of members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
our exploration and exploitation success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professionals 
competition for experienced professionals is extremely intense 
if we cannot attract or retain experienced technical personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
we do not have key man insurance 
governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  might impose regulations that increase our costs and may terminate or suspend our operations 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations as interpreted by governmental agencies and other bodies  including those in california  vested with broad authority relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
existing laws and regulations  or their interpretations  could be changed  and any changes could increase costs of compliance and costs of operating drilling equipment or significantly limit drilling activity 

table of contents under certain circumstances  the united states minerals management service  or mms  may require that our operations on federal leases be suspended or terminated 
these circumstances include our failure to pay royalties or our failure to comply with safety and environmental regulations 
the requirements imposed by these laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to new interpretations 
environmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
the oil and gas business is subject to environmental hazards  such as oil spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances  and historic disposal activities 
these environmental hazards could expose us to material liabilities for property damages  personal injuries or other environmental harm  including costs of investigating and remediating contaminated properties 
we also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating 
a variety of stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of our business and impose strict requirements for  among other things well drilling or workover  operation and abandonment  waste management  land reclamation  financial assurance under the oil pollution act of  and controlling air  water and waste emissions 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production  and may affect our costs of acquisitions 
in addition  environmental laws may  in the future  cause a decrease in our production or cause an increase in our costs of production  development or exploration 
pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
some of our onshore california fields have been in operation for more than years  and current or future local  state and federal environmental and other laws and regulations may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these laws and regulations 
in addition  approximately acres of our acres in the montebello field have been designated as california coastal sage scrub  a known habitat for the coastal california gnatcatcher  which is a type of bird designated as threatened under the federal endangered species act 
a variety of existing laws  rules and guidelines govern activities that can be conducted on properties that contain coastal sage scrub and gnatcatchers and generally limit the scope of operations that we can conduct on this property 
the presence of coastal sage scrub and gnatcatchers in the montebello field and other existing or future laws  rules and guidelines could prohibit or limit our operations and our planned activities for this property 

table of contents our acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future  which could adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our growth strategy may include acquiring oil and gas businesses and properties 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully 
furthermore  acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  the need to integrate acquired operations  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies  difficulty in assuming recoverable reserves  future production rates  operating costs  infrastructure requirements  environmental and other liabilities  and other factors beyond our control  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired business  and an increase in our expenses and working capital requirements 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from the acquired businesses or realize other anticipated benefits of those acquisitions 
our net income could be negatively affected by stock based compensation charges 
stock appreciation rights sars are subject to variable accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r effective january  sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
under sfas r our sars will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
as a result  we expect volatility in our earnings as our stock price changes 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method pursuant to apb accordingly  we have historically recognized compensation expense for our sars based on changes in intrinsic value 
the final expense recognized at settlement under either accounting method will equal the cash payment to settle the sar 
the adoption of sfas r may cause additional volatility in reported earnings 
we recognized million  million and million of sar expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we expect that certain of our restricted stock awards will become subject to variable accounting in any awards that become subject to variable accounting will be accounted for in a similar manner to our existing sars and will create additional volatility in our reported earnings 
we will adopt sfas r effective january  we are completing our assessment of sfas r and the effect it will have on our financial statements 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price plus the liabilities assumed  including deferred income taxes recorded in connection with the transaction  over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
at december  goodwill totaled million and represented of our total assets 

table of contents goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent of any excess of its carrying amount over the residual fair value of the reporting unit 
such impairment could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity 
the most significant factors that could result in the impairment of our goodwill would be significant declines in oil and gas prices and or reserve volumes which would result in a decline in the fair value of our oil and gas properties

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
company overview we are an independent oil and gas company primarily engaged in the activities of acquiring  developing  exploiting  exploring and producing oil and gas properties in the united states 
we own oil and gas properties in six states with principal operations in the los angeles and san joaquin basins onshore california  the santa maria basin offshore california  the gulf coast basin onshore and offshore louisiana  including the gulf of mexico  and the val verde portion of the greater permian basin in texas 
assets in our principal focus areas include mature properties with long lived reserves and significant development and exploitation opportunities as well as newer properties with development  exploitation and exploration potential 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and our revolving credit facility 
at december  we had approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we have a capital budget for  excluding acquisitions  of million 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity through our cash from operations and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility to meet our short term and long term normal recurring operating needs  derivative obligations  debt service obligations  contingencies  anticipated capital expenditures and expenditures under our stock repurchase program 
in addition  the majority of our capital expenditures and expenditures under our stock repurchase program are discretionary and could be curtailed if our cash flows declined from expected levels 
our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas  the success of our acquisition and drilling activities and the operational performance of our producing properties 
we use derivative instruments to manage our commodity price risk 
this practice may prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the derivative agreement 
the level of derivative activity depends on our view of market conditions  available derivative prices and our operating strategy see derivative instruments and hedging 
acquisitions and dispositions in april we acquired certain california producing oil and gas properties from a private company for million 
the properties are primarily located in the los angeles basin of onshore california with some smaller properties located in adjacent ventura county 
the transaction was financed under our credit facility 
in september we acquired an additional interest in the point arguello unit  rocky point development project and related facilities  offshore california  from subsidiaries of chevron usa inc this acquisition increased our working interest to

table of contents in june  we acquired tec for a combination of cash and common stock 
we accounted for the acquisition of tec as a purchase effective june  see items and business and properties acquisitions tec energy corporation 
we periodically evaluate and from time to time have elected to sell certain of our mature producing properties that we consider to be nonstrategic 
such sales enable us to focus on our core properties  maintain financial flexibility and redeploy the proceeds therefrom to activities that we believe potentially have a higher financial return 
in may we closed the sale to xto energy  inc of interests in producing properties located in east texas and oklahoma for net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were primarily used to fund the transactions to eliminate all of our oil price swaps and collars as discussed in derivative instruments and hedging 
in december  we completed the sale of certain properties located offshore california and onshore south texas  new mexico and south louisiana 
these divestments were conducted via negotiated and auction transactions and we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in a series of unrelated transactions in the first and second quarters of we sold our interests in certain non core producing properties in new mexico  texas  mississippi  louisiana and illinois for proceeds of approximately million 
derivative instruments and hedging in may we completed a series of transactions that eliminated our collars on  barrels of oil per day with a floor price of and an average ceiling price of and our swaps on  barrels of oil per day with an average price of at a pre tax cost of approximately million approximately million attributable to the collars and million attributable to the swaps 
the collars were not accounted for as hedges  therefore  the million loss in the fair value of these instruments was currently recognized in our income statement and there will be no income statement effect subsequent to march  we used hedge accounting for the swaps through march and as a result the million loss in fair value attributable to the swaps has been deferred in other comprehensive income oci and will be recognized as a noncash reduction to oil revenues in when the hedged production is sold 
the million cash payment for the collars is reflected as a financing cash outflow in our statement of cash flows and the million cash payment for the swaps is reflected as an operating cash outflow in our statement of cash flows 
these payments reduced derivative liabilities on our balance sheet 
for  our crude oil derivative position consists exclusively of purchased put option contracts with a strike price of 
the only cash settlements we are required to make on these contracts are option premiums  which are expected to total approximately million per month 
in return  to the extent the daily average nymex price for west texas intermediate crude oil is less than  we will receive the difference between and the daily average nymex price for west texas intermediate crude oil 
in addition to the put options  our crude oil hedge position includes additional put options in and collar positions in and in we also have call options on  mmbtu per day of natural gas 
see item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks for a summary of our current derivative positions 
as all of such derivative contracts are accounted for under mark to market accounting we expect continued volatility in our reported earnings due to gains and losses on these contracts as changes occur in the nymex price index 

table of contents general we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development activities are capitalized 
our revenues are derived from the sale of oil  gas and natural gas liquids 
we recognize revenues when our production is sold and title is transferred 
our revenues are highly dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our levels of production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including supply and demand  economic conditions  foreign imports  the actions of opec  political conditions in other oil producing countries  and governmental regulation  legislation and policies 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter to determine a ceiling value of our properties 
the rules require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed the allowed ceiling 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will fluctuate in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had  and will likely have in the future  an adverse effect on the carrying value of our estimated proved reserves  our reserve volumes and our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
our oil and gas production expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel involved in production activities  steam gas costs  electric costs  maintenance costs  production  ad valorem and severance taxes  and other costs necessary to operate our producing properties 
depletion of capitalized costs of producing oil and gas properties is provided using the units of production method based upon estimated proved reserves 
for the purposes of computing depletion  estimated proved reserves are redetermined as of the end of each year and on an interim basis when deemed necessary 
general and administrative expenses g a consist primarily of salaries and related benefits of administrative personnel  office rent  systems costs and other administrative costs

our cash flows depend on many factors  including the price of oil and gas  the success of our acquisition and drilling activities and the operational performance of our producing properties 
we use derivative instruments to manage our commodity price risk 
this practice may prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the derivative agreement

stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the shares will be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions at our discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
we expect that the funds for these purchases will come primarily from cash flow in excess of capital investments

our stock price was per share on december  versus per share on december  and we recognized million of expense in we incur cash expenditures upon the exercise of sars  but our common shares outstanding do not increase

if all of the vested sars were exercised  based on  the price of our common stock as of december   we would pay million to holders of the sars 
in we made cash payments of million for sars that were exercised during that period 

table of contents commitments and contingencies contractual obligations 
at december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years are as follows in thousands and and thereafter operating leases producing property remediation commodity derivative contracts long term debt interest on debt other operating leases relate primarily to obligations associated with our office facilities and certain cogeneration operations in california 
the obligation for commodity derivative contracts represents the cost to purchase certain crude oil put options and natural gas call options that will be paid when such options are settled and amounts payable in related to contracts that matured in the obligation for producing property remediation consists of obligations associated with the purchase of certain of our california properties 
the long term debt and interest payments amounts consist of amounts due under our credit facility  notes and notes and interest payments to maturity 
the principal amount under our credit facility varies based on our cash inflows and outflows and the amounts reflected in this table assume the principal amount outstanding at december  remains outstanding to maturity with interest and commitment fees calculated at the rates in effect at that date 
our liabilities also include asset retirement obligations million current and million long term that represent the estimated fair value at december  of our obligations with respect to the retirement abandonment of our oil and gas properties 
each reporting period the liability is accreted to its then present value 
the ultimate settlement amount and the timing of the settlement of such obligations is unknown because they are subject to  among other things  federal  state and local regulation and economic factors

environmental matters 
as discussed under business properties regulation environmental  as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  
table of contents the environment 
typically when producing oil and gas assets are purchased  one assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we have received an indemnity in connection with such purchase 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect on these indemnities 
often these regulations are more burdensome on older properties that were operated before the regulations came into effect such as some of our properties in california that have operated for over years 
we have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
we also maintain insurance coverage for environmental matters  which we believe is customary in the industry  but we are not fully insured against all environmental risks 
there can be no assurance that current or future local  state or federal rules and regulations will not require us to spend material amounts to comply with such rules and regulations 
in january we discovered and self reported a violation related to flared gas emissions in excess of permitted levels on properties acquired in the nuevo acquisition 
estimated excess emissions from the san joaquin valley casing vent recovery system located on the gamble lease were approximately tons over a day period 
we brought the facility into compliance within days of discovering the violation 
we settled this matter in for  plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
consistent with normal industry practices  substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that  upon termination of economic production  the working interest owners plug and abandon non producing wellbores  remove tanks  production equipment and flow lines and restore the wellsite 
typically  when producing oil and gas assets are purchased the purchaser assumes the obligation to plug and abandon wells that are part of such assets 
however  in some instances  we received an indemnity with respect to those costs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to collect on these indemnities 
we estimate our cash expenditures related to plugging  abandonment and remediation will be approximately million 
due to the long life of our onshore california reserve base we do not expect our cash outlays for such expenditures for these properties will increase significantly in the next several years 
although our offshore california properties have a shorter reserve life  third parties have retained the majority of the obligations for abandoning these properties 
in connection with the sale of certain properties offshore california in december we retained the responsibility for certain abandonment costs  including removing  dismantling and disposing of the existing offshore platforms 
the present value of such abandonment costs  million million undiscounted  are included in our asset retirement obligation as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we agreed to guarantee the performance of the purchaser with respect to the remaining abandonment obligations related to the properties approximately million 
the fair value of our obligation  million  is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
for a further discussion of our obligations to incur plugging  abandonment and remediation costs  see items and business and properties plugging  abandonment and remediation obligations 
other commitments and contingencies 
as is common within the industry  we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved crude oil and natural gas properties and the marketing  transportation and storage of crude oil 
it is management s belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
operating risks and insurance coverage 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and gas  including well blowouts  cratering  
table of contents explosions  oil spills  releases of gas or well fluids  fires  pollution and releases of toxic gas  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
our operations in california  including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles  are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury  property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern california 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against all risks  either because insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we maintain coverage for earthquake damages in california but this coverage may not provide for the full effect of damages that could occur and we may be subject to additional liabilities 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured against could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with operating our pipelines  including the potential loss of significant revenues 
consistent with insurance coverage generally available to the industry  our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution  with broader coverage for sudden and accidental occurrences 
sale of nuevo s congo operations 
upon our acquisition of nuevo  we became a party to an existing agreement between nuevo  cms nomeco oil gas co 
cms and a third party 
under the agreement  nuevo and cms may be liable to the third party for the recapture of dual consolidated losses dcls in connection with each company s acquisition of congolese properties 
nuevo and cms agreed to indemnify each other for any act that would cause the third party to experience a liability from the recapture of dcls as a result of a triggering event 
cms sold its interest in the congolese properties to a subsidiary of perenco  sa perenco in both cms and perenco  have received from the internal revenue service irs  in accordance with the us consolidated return regulations  a closing agreement confirming that the transaction will not trigger recapture 
we and perenco have finalized closing agreements with the irs confirming that neither our merger with nuevo  nor the sale of our interest in the congolese properties to perenco will trigger recapture 
the estimated remaining contingent liabilities are million relative to nuevo s former interest  and million relative to cms former interest  for which we would be jointly liable 
we believe the occurrence of a triggering event in the future is remote and we do not believe the agreements will have a material adverse affect upon us 
industry concentration financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable with respect to our oil and gas operations and derivative instruments related to our hedging activities 
during  and sales to paa accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues and during and sales to conocophillips accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during such periods no other purchaser accounted for more than of our total revenues 
the loss of any single significant customer or contract could have a material adverse short term effect  however  we do not believe that the loss of any single significant customer or contract would materially affect our business in the long term 
we believe such purchasers could be replaced by other purchasers under contracts with similar terms and conditions 
however  their role as the purchaser of a significant portion of our oil production does have the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that they may be affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
the seven financial institutions that are contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts all have standard poor s ratings of a or better and all seven of the financial institutions are participating lenders in our revolving credit facility 
at december  we were in a net liability position with all such counterparties 

table of contents there are a limited number of alternative methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in our having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production which could have a negative impact on future results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and factors that may affect future results based on the accounting policies which we have in place  certain factors may impact our future financial results 
the most significant of these factors and their effect on certain of our accounting policies are discussed below 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
prices for oil and gas have historically been volatile 
decreases in oil and gas prices from current levels will adversely affect our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserve volumes and value 
if the industry experiences significant prolonged future price decreases  this could be materially adverse to our operations and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures 
periodically  we enter into derivative arrangements relating to a portion of our oil and gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce our exposure to adverse price fluctuations 
derivative instruments used are typically fixed price swaps and collars and purchased puts and calls 
while the use of these types of instruments limits our downside risk to adverse price movements  we are subject to a number of risks  including instances in which the benefit to revenues and cash flows is limited when commodity prices increase 
we do not use hedge accounting for certain of our derivative instruments  because the derivatives do not qualify or we have elected not to use hedge accounting 
these derivative contracts are marked to market each quarter with fair value gains and losses  both realized and unrealized  recognized currently as a gain or loss on mark to market derivative contracts on the income statement 
consequently  we expect continued volatility in our reported earnings as changes occur in the nymex indexes 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making or receiving a payment from the counterparty 
the estimation of fair values of derivative instruments requires substantial judgment 
we estimate the fair values of our derivatives using an option pricing model 
the option pricing model utilizes various factors including nymex and over the counter price quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows outflows over the lives of the derivative instruments are discounted using rates under our revolving credit facility 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
for a further discussion concerning our risks related to oil and gas prices and our hedging programs  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
write downs under full cost ceiling test rules 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter 
under these rules  capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes may not exceed a ceiling equal to the standardized measure including  for this test only  the effect of any related hedging activities  plus 
table of contents the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized net of related tax effects 
these rules generally require that we price our future oil and gas production at the oil and gas prices in effect at the end of each fiscal quarter and require a write down if our capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  even if prices declined for only a short period of time 
we have had no write downs due to these ceiling test limitations since given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly in the future  even if only for a short period of time  write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur 
write downs required by these rules do not directly impact our cash flows from operating activities 
oil and gas reserves 
our proved reserve information is based on estimates prepared by outside engineering firms 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than these estimates 
estimates of proved reserves may be different from the actual quantities of oil and gas recovered because such estimates depend on many assumptions and are based on operating conditions and results at the time the estimate is made 
the actual results of drilling and testing  as well as changes in production rates and recovery factors  can vary significantly from those assumed in the preparation of reserve estimates 
as a result  such factors have historically  and can in the future  cause significant upward and downward revisions to proved reserve estimates 
you should not assume that the standardized measure reflects the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
a large portion of our reserve base approximately at december  is comprised of oil properties that are sensitive to oil price volatility 
historically  we have experienced significant upward and downward revisions to our reserves volumes and values as a result of changes in year end oil and gas prices and the corresponding adjustment to the projected economic life of such properties 
prices for oil and gas are likely to continue to be volatile  resulting in future downward and upward revisions to our reserve base 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves including future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the ceiling test discussed above 
in addition  increases in costs required to develop our reserves would increase the rate at which we record dd a expense 
we are unable to predict changes in future development costs as such costs are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
stock based compensation 
sars are subject to variable accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
we will adopt sfas r effective january  sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
under sfas r our sars will be remeasured to fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
as a result  we expect volatility in our earnings as our stock price changes 

table of contents prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method pursuant to apb accordingly  we have historically recognized compensation expense for our sars based on changes in intrinsic value 
the final expense recognized at settlement under either accounting method will equal the cash payment to settle the sar 
the adoption of sfas r may cause additional volatility in reported earnings 
we recognized million  million and million of sar expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we expect that certain of our restricted stock awards will become subject to variable accounting in any awards that become subject to variable accounting will be accounted for in a similar manner to our existing sars and will create additional volatility in our reported earnings 
we will adopt sfas r effective january  we are completing our assessment of sfas r and the effect it will have on our financial statements 
goodwill 
in a purchase transaction  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price plus the liabilities assumed  including deferred income taxes recorded in connection with the merger  over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
at december  goodwill totaled million and represented approximately of our total assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized  it is tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
a two step impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
we follow the full cost method of accounting and all of our operations are located in the united states 
we have determined that for the purpose of performing an impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 the company is the reporting unit 
sfas states that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and shall be used as the basis for the measurement  if available 
accordingly  we use the quoted market price of our common stock to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
an impairment of goodwill could significantly reduce earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and stockholders equity 
the most significant factors that could result in the impairment of our goodwill would be significant declines in oil and gas prices and or estimated reserve volumes which would result in a decline in the fair value of our reporting unit 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas r 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r that requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial 
table of contents statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas and supersedes apb public entities other than those filing as small business issuers were originally required to apply sfas r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  on april  the sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance dates for sfas r 
the commission s new rule allows registrants to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year 
we will adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective approach as allowed under sfas r 
under this approach  the valuation of equity instruments ie  restricted stock and restricted stock units granted prior to the adoption of r will not be affected  however  the valuation of liability instruments ie  sars granted prior to the adoption of r will be revalued under a fair value approach instead of the previously applied intrinsic valuation 
in addition  sfas r requires us to begin estimating expected future forfeitures under each stock compensation plan 
we are completing our assessment of sfas r and the effect it will have on our financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in sfas a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the company 
fin states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable 
fin is intended to provide more information about long lived assets and future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities 
our financial position  results of operations or cash flows were not impacted by the implementation of fin sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring voluntary changes in accounting principles to be reported using retrospective application  unless impracticable to do so 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
application is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt sfas on january  and we do not believe that our financial position  results of operations or cash flows will be impacted 
eitf accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
steam generators utilized in our thermal recovery operations in california are fueled by natural gas 
in certain instances we have entered into buy sell contracts that allow us to exchange gas we produce elsewhere for gas delivered to our thermal recovery operations 
we did not enter into buy sell contracts in periods prior to our acquisition of nuevo energy company in may in september in issue no 
 the eitf reached a consensus that two or more inventory transactions with the same counterparty should be viewed as a single nonmonetary if the transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another as determined in accordance with issue no 


table of contents we have determined that transactions under certain of our buy sell contracts should be presented net in accordance with issue no 
we will apply issue no 
effective january  and  accordingly  certain costs included in operating costs in and will be included as a reduction of revenues in and subsequent periods 
our financial position  results of operations or cash flows will not be impacted by the implementation of issue no 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks commodity price risk we use various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to commodity price risk on sales of oil and gas production 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the changes in fair value  both realized and unrealized  are recognized currently in our income statement as gain loss on mark to market derivative contracts 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making or receiving a payment from the counterparty 
if a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting  any unrealized gain or loss is deferred in accumulated oci  a component of stockholders equity  until the hedged oil and gas production is sold 
realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are designated as a hedge and qualify for hedge accounting are generally included in oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged volumes are sold 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain in oci until the related product has been delivered 
in may we completed a series of transactions that eliminated our collars on  barrels of oil per day with a floor price of and an average ceiling price of and our swaps on  barrels of oil per day at an average price of at a pre tax cost of approximately million approximately million attributable to the collars and million attributable to the swaps 
the collars were not accounted for as hedges  therefore  the million loss in the fair value of these instruments was currently recognized in our income statement and there will be no income statement effect subsequent to march  we used hedge accounting for the swaps through march and as a result the million loss in fair value attributable to the swaps has been deferred in oci and will be recognized as a noncash reduction to oil revenues in when the hedged production is sold 
these payments reduced derivative liabilities on our balance sheet 
in we entered into a series of transactions that resulted in us now holding nymex put options with a strike price of per barrel on  barrels of oil per day in and these put options cost an average of per barrel for and per barrel for  which will be paid when the options are settled 
we have elected not to use hedge accounting for the puts  consequently  the puts are marked to market with fair value gains and losses recognized as a gain or loss on mark to market derivative contracts on the income statement 
we purchase natural gas that is utilized in our steam flood operations 
in october we acquired nymex call options with a strike price of per mmbtu on  mmbtu of natural gas per day in these call options cost an average of per mmbtu  which will be paid when the options are settled 
we have elected not to use hedge accounting for the calls  consequently  the calls will be marked to market with fair value gains and losses recognized as a gain or loss on mark to market derivative contracts on the income statement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements derivative instruments and hedging activities for a complete discussion of our hedging activities

the fair value of outstanding crude oil and natural gas commodity derivative instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a price increase are shown in the table below in millions december  fair value effect of price increase fair value effect of price increase derivatives designated as cash flow hedges derivatives not designated as hedging instruments the fair value of the commodity derivative contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from independent reporting services compared to the contract price of the agreement  and approximate the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at period end 
all positions offset physical positions exposed to the cash market 
none of these offsetting physical positions are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board increase in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
we have nymex put options with a strike price of per barrel on  barrels of oil per day in and these put options cost an average of per barrel for and per barrel for a total of million  which will be paid when the options are settled 
we also have nymex call options with a strike price of per mmbtu on  mmbtu of natural gas per day in these call options cost an average of per mmbtu a total of million  which will be paid when the options are settled 
such amounts is not included in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the foregoing table 
the seven financial institutions that are contract counterparties for our derivative commodity contracts all have standard poor s ratings of a or better and all seven of the financial institutions are participating lenders in our revolving credit facility 
at december  we were in a net liability position with all such counterparties 

table of contents our management intends to continue to maintain derivative arrangements for a portion of our production 
these contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
our derivative arrangements provide us protection on the volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these derivatives are set  but ceiling prices in our derivatives may cause us to receive less revenues on the volumes than we would receive in the absence of derivatives 
price differentials 
our realized wellhead oil and gas prices are lower than the nymex index level as a result of area and quality differentials 
see items and business and properties product markets and major customers 
approximately of our gas production is sold monthly off of industry recognized  published index pricing and the remainder is priced daily on the spot market 
fluctuations between the two pricing mechanisms can significantly impact the overall differential to the henry hub 
interest rate risk we use both fixed and variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
our notes and notes are fixed rate notes and are not subject to market risk 
our senior revolving credit facility and our short term credit facility have variable rates 
at december  million was outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility at an effective interest rate of 
no amounts were outstanding under our short term credit facility at december  based on the million outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility at december   on an annualized basis a change in the effective interest rate would result in a million change in our interest costs
