except for the accelerated vesting  all other material terms and conditions of the previously granted awards remain unchanged 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made to reduce non cash compensation expense that would otherwise have been recorded in future periods following the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which became effective for the company on march  the accelerated vesting resulted in a one time non cash stock based compensation charge of approximately  or

critical accounting policies the company believes that the accounting policies listed below are those that are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 
inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically the company has been able to return excess items to vendors for credit or sell such inventory to wholesalers 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the amount paid in consideration for an acquisition in excess of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill for acquisitions made after june  the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually  typically during the third quarter of the fiscal year  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
these impairment tests include management estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by operating unit 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such instances  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company shortens the depreciable life of the related assets to coincide with the planned sale or closing date 
self insurance reserves the company is largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted 
warranty the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to sales  except for tire road hazard warranties which are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin the warranty reserve and warranty expense related to all product warranties at and for the fiscal years ended march  and were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from stores added since march   and a comparable store sales increase of 
the company also sold some slower moving inventory for approximately million to icon international  a barter company 
there were selling days in fiscal year compared to selling days in fiscal year adjusting for days  comparable store sales increased 
the bulk sale of inventory to icon was an important transaction for the company 
the sale will help to improve inventory turns  which becomes a higher priority as interest rates continue to rise  and in light of the accounting rules of emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which require that vendor rebates be recognized as inventory turns 
as new vendor agreements fall under these rules  inventory turns have a more direct impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit than in the past 
during the year  stores were added and were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors  including an increase in tire sales and scheduled maintenance services 
price increases in several product categories also contributed to the sales improvement 
while comparable store traffic declined slightly  average ticket increased 
management believes that soft economic conditions resulted in consumers deferring repairs to their vehicles 
however  most repairs can only be deferred for a period of time 
when customers did come in to have their vehicles repaired  they spent more on average  most likely because the problem with their vehicle had worsened due to additional wear 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers typically provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will continue to contribute positively to comparable store sales in future years  and have helped to mitigate the decline in exhaust which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
the exhaust decline resulted primarily from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on most new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s 
additionally  the company continued to reward store employees with pay programs focused on high customer service scores 
management believes that  in spite of the sluggish economic environment  it is continuing to build the trust of its customers  through quality  integrity and fair pricing  and is gaining an advantage over some of its competitors 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to an increase in material costs due to a shift in mix to the lower margin categories of tires and maintenance services 
on a consolidated basis  tires represented of sales in fiscal as compared to of sales in fiscal maintenance services increased from of sales to of sales  while the core services of brakes  exhaust and steering all decreased as a percent of sales from the prior year 
the company also experienced cost increases in oil and tires 
additionally  the bulk sale of inventory to icon was at a lower margin than monro s typical sales  although there were no labor costs  and accounted for a slight decrease in gross margin 
however  price increases  as well as the recognition of vendor rebates against cost of goods in concert with inventory turns in accordance with eitf  helped to partially offset the aforementioned margin pressures 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases in technician labor and occupancy costs  which are included in cost of sales 
technician labor costs decreased due to better operational control and improved productivity 
additionally  the increase in tire sales  which carry lower labor costs as compared to other service categories  helped to decrease labor costs as a percent of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal also decreased as compared to fiscal  as the company  with improved sales  was able to leverage these largely fixed costs 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million  but decreased as a percentage of sales to compared to in the decrease is partially due to the leveraging of fixed costs against sales  including the bulk inventory sale

price increases in several product categories also contributed to the sales improvement 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to an increase in material costs due to a shift in mix to the lower margin categories of tires and maintenance services 
included in the maintenance categories are oil changes which increased approximately on a comparable store basis over the prior year 
the company promoted oil changes to drive traffic during the year  by slightly lowering the selling price in the second half of fiscal  while experiencing an increase in the cost of oil 
this had the effect of lowering margin in the maintenance category as compared to the prior year 
additionally  transmission and coolant flushes increased in fiscal over on a comparable store basis  partially due to increased emphasis by management and increased selling prices

without mr 
tire s results  gross profit increased from last year to this year  partially due to a reduction in total material costs  as well as through increased leveraging of distribution and occupancy costs 
the improvement in material costs apart from the acquired mr 
tire stores was due primarily to a reduction in outside purchases 
the company has continued to add inventory to its stores and warehouses in fiscal in a concerted effort to reduce outbuys 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  remained flat as compared to fiscal the increase in expenditures is primarily due to the store direct costs associated with new stores  as well as increased store manager wages to improve the quality and retention of this highly important position for the company  increased insurance costs  increased expense to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements and increased utility costs

total capital required to open a new store ranges  on average based upon the last five fiscal years openings excluding the acquired stores and bj s locations  from  to  depending on whether the store is leased  owned or land leased 
total capital required to open a store within a bj s wholesale club is substantially less than for a greenfield store 
the company also plans to continue to seek suitable acquisition candidates

within the aforementioned million revolving credit facility  the company has available a sub facility of million for the purpose of issuing standby letters of credit 
the line requires fees aggregating 
annually of the face amount of each standby letter of credit  payable quarterly in arrears

certain of the company s long term debt agreements require  among other things  the maintenance of specified interest and rent coverage ratios and amounts of net worth 
they also contain restrictions on dividend payments 
the company is in compliance with these requirements at march  these agreements permit mortgages and specific lease financing arrangements with other parties with certain limitations 
from time to time  the company enters into interest rate hedge agreements  which involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts

at year end march and  approximately of the company s long term debt  excluding capital leases  was at fixed interest rates and therefore  the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates

million based upon the company s debt position at fiscal year ended march  and 
million for fiscal year ended march   given a change in libor
