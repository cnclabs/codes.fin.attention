item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies are as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies  which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are as follows allowance for loan losses 
arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in 
back to index ways currently unforeseen 
although we believe that we use the appropriate information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause an increase in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
the allowance for loan losses discussion in item provides additional information about the allowance 
income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation and evaluation of the timing and recognition of resulting tax liabilities and assets 
management uses the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
management must assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset  including the carry forward of a portion of the charitable contribution  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in conjunction with the acquisition of woronoco bancorp in  goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset equal to the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets were recorded for the fair value of core deposits and non compete agreements 
the valuation techniques used by management to determine the carrying value of assets acquired in the acquisition and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates which were used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations

total impaired loans increased to million from million during the ratio of net loan charge offs decreased to of average total loans in  compared to in while the company believes that the long run credit losses implicit in the portfolio are higher than the current level of charge offs  management did not feel at year end that there were any evident signals of near term changes in the levels of charge offs and problem loans 
the allowance for loan losses declined to of total loans at year end  compared to at the prior year end 
this was primarily due to the addition of low risk residential mortgage and home equity loans from woronoco 
the total loan loss allowance increased by million to million at year end  primarily due to a million allowance for loan losses acquired from woronoco 
the specific allowance for impaired loans increased only slightly to  from  during this period 
this reserve decreased to of total impaired loans from during the year  indicating better average collateral coverage of impaired loans 
the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans improved to x at year end  compared to x at year end investment securities

the end result of the year s changes in was an increase in municipal bonds and obligations including industrial revenue bonds and a decrease in mortgage backed securities 
the bank had increased its mortgage backed securities portfolio in to leverage the bank s capital and to take advantage of a steep yield curve 
due to the leverage of the woronoco acquisition and the flattening of the yield curve in  the bank decreased this portfolio 
the increase in the municipal securities portfolio was due to the acquisition of woronoco  which had a higher concentration in these tax advantaged securities 
additionally  equity securities increased due to the additional fhlbb stock added through the woronoco acquisition 
fhlbb stock totaled million at year end the total net unrealized loss on investment securities was million at year end  compared to a gain of million at the prior year end

the bank has promoted lower cost transaction accounts as a significant component of its strategic growth 
excluding the impact of acquired balances  total transaction deposits increased by million during the year 
borrowings totaled million at year end  increasing by million from million at year end this increase included million in borrowings acquired with woronoco  partially offset by the deleveraging program  under which the proceeds of loan and securities sales were used to repay borrowings 
additionally  proceeds from deposit growth were used to replace maturing borrowings during the year 
borrowings included million of junior subordinated debentures issued 
back to index by the company in june in conjunction with a trust preferred security offering used to supplement the bank s regulatory capital 
equity 
stockholders equity totaled million at year end  increasing by million  or  from year end consideration for the woronoco acquisition included the issuance of million new common shares valued at million  with an additional million credit to equity for the value of outstanding woronoco stock options 
the esop termination had no negative impact on stockholders equity because the related charge to earnings was offset by credits to unearned compensation and additional paid in capital 
these credits also offset the million impact of the prepayment of the esop loan  which resulted in the transfer of  shares to treasury stock 
the contribution of earnings was mostly offset by dividends  additional treasury stock purchases of million  and a million net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income due to gains recorded on securities sales and lower debt securities prices due to higher interest rates 
the company announced an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per share in august  representing a increase from per share in prior quarters 
goodwill increased to million and identifiable intangible assets increased to million at year end due mainly to the woronoco acquisition 
as a result  year end tangible book value per share was  compared to at year end the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets measured at year end  compared to at the prior year end  due to the issuance of new common shares and the deleveraging program executed in conjunction with the woronoco acquisition 
the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets measured at year end  a decrease from at year end  reflecting the impact of the higher goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the acquisition 
at year end  the bank met all regulatory capital requirements and the bank continued to satisfy the conditions necessary to be classified as well capitalized in accordance with federal regulatory standards 
the bank paid million in cash dividends to the company during relating to the acquisition of woronoco bancorp 
substantially all of the net assets acquired were contributed to the bank by the company as additional paid in capital 
because the bank s dividends exceeded retained earnings from recent operations in accordance with certain regulatory measurements  the bank s dividends to the company in required specific regulatory approval

these instruments are described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income for was million  compared to million in results in included a non cash charge of million for the termination of the employee stock ownership plan esop 
this charge had no negative impact on stockholders equity due to offsetting credits to unearned compensation and additional paid in capital 
diluted earnings per share totaled in  compared to in the fourth quarter was the first full quarter after the integration of the acquired woronoco operations 
fourth quarter net income totaled million in  compared to million in fourth quarter diluted earnings per share totaled in both years  due to the impact of additional shares issued in conjunction with the woronoco acquisition 
the fourth quarter return on assets measured in  compared to in the fourth quarter return on equity measured compared to  reflecting the additional equity recorded for the issuance of shares for the acquisition 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  due to the balance sheet growth 
the net interest margin fully taxable equivalent decreased to from  including the impact of the woronoco acquisition and deleveraging 
the primary impact of market conditions was the flattening of the interest rate yield curve  which narrowed the marginal earnings spread on many asset liability combinations 
the flattening of the yield curve was due to a steady increase in short term rates during the year  with a much smaller increase in long term rates 
the increase in short term rates benefited the bank s interest sensitive assets  but also produced significant competition for deposits  which had fallen to very low rates in recent years 
the net impact of these market conditions was unfavorable  and management sought to mitigate this by promoting transaction deposit accounts and relationship deposit offerings  and also by continuing to focus on commercial loan growth 
the decline in the net interest margin also included a annualized impact from the purchase of bank owned life insurance in the fourth quarter of 
back to index due to rising interest rates  both asset yields and liability costs increased during in recent years  the bank has generally positioned itself to be slightly asset sensitive in order to obtain the benefit of anticipated rising interest rates 
in the case of a sudden interest rate shock  the bank was modestly liability sensitive at the end of this change in sensitivity primarily reflected the effect of higher optionality in the woronoco balance sheet under the higher interest rate conditions prevailing at the end of the bank believed that its year end interest rate risk was generally neutral to the impact of gradual parallel shifts in interest rates based on its interest sensitivity model 
however  changes in the yield curve and in other market conditions could continue to be unfavorable based on the year end conditions and outlook  and the bank continued to pursue strategies aimed at mitigating this impact 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by the company 
the level of the allowance is a critical accounting estimate  which is subject to uncertainty 
the level of the allowance at december  was discussed in the previous section on asset quality in the discussion of financial condition at year end net loan charge offs were at a five year low in  and the ratio of net charge offs to average loans declined to a relatively low in the provision for loan losses was also the lowest amount in the five year history  and the provision has generally trended down as charge offs have declined 
the provision measured of net charge offs in  compared to in the prior year 
non interest income 
non interest income increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to the addition of the woronoco contribution beginning on june  together with higher securities gains and organic revenue growth 
service fee income totaled million for the year  and measured of average assets  compared to of average assets in the previous year 
about half of the improvement in this ratio was due to growth in insurance commissions and loan servicing fees  and this growth was directly tied to the woronoco acquisition 
woronoco operated a property and casualty insurance subsidiary which has been renamed the berkshire insurance group 
additionally  woronoco had a larger residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio 
the other half of the improvement in this ratio was primarily due to growth in overdraft fees  as was the first full year of operations of the bank s courtesy overdraft protection program

also included in these charges were interim staffing and systems costs of woronoco operations in the third quarter through the conversion in august 
the ratio of non interest expense to average assets was in  compared to in excluding the esop termination and merger and conversion expenses  this ratio decreased to in  illustrating the efficiencies resulting from the merger 
the company estimated that total cost savings and integration efficiencies related to the woronoco acquisition equated to about of woronoco s first quarter non interest expense  excluding merger related charges 
these cost savings exceeded the company s original objective for cost savings 
expenses in included  in operating costs of new branches and expanded commercial lending 
additionally  amortization of intangible assets increased to million in due to the amortization of the core deposit intangible and non competition agreement intangible assets recorded as part of the woronoco acquisition 
income tax expense and discontinued operations 
the effective income tax rate measured in  excluding the esop termination charge and a related  benefit  compared to in the bank benefits from securities purchased in 
back to index the bank s subsidiary securities corporations  which are taxed at a lower state income tax rate

results in also included net losses of  in the first six months  representing the after tax loss on discontinued operations of eastpoint technologies  llc  which was sold in june comprehensive income 
comprehensive income includes changes in accumulated other comprehensive income  which consist of changes after tax in the unrealized market gains and losses of investment securities available for sale and net gain loss on derivative instruments 
the company recorded million in total comprehensive income in compared to million in this reflected the lower net income recorded  along with a million other net comprehensive loss in related primarily to changes in securities values  which is discussed further in the securities note of the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and net income 
net income for the year was a record million  compared to million for net income from continuing operations totaled million for the year  compared to million for  excluding the loss from discontinued operations of eastpoint technologies  llc  which was sold in june earnings from continuing operations were a record per diluted share for the year  an increase of over prior year results 
net income after the loss from discontinued operations was per diluted share  an increase of over prior year results 
the company s performance in benefited from a million increase in net interest income  resulting from growth in loans and investments 
total service fee income increased by in  while non interest expense growth was limited to 
the return on average stockholders equity increased to in  compared to in the return on average assets increased to from for the same periods 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in average earning assets increased by million  or in this growth in earning assets more than offset the impact of a decrease in the net interest margin to in from in the prior year 
interest rates had declined to relative lows in and  prompting higher prepayment speeds for loans and mortgage backed securities 
these proceeds were reinvested at lower yields  reflecting lower market rates and management s strategy to shorten the duration of these assets 
the company used borrowings to fund earning asset growth  lowering the cost of new funds compared to higher costing time certificates of deposit 
average earning asset growth was concentrated in average investment securities  which increased by million in  reflecting securities purchased during and  as well as the securitization of million in residential mortgages during that period 
the yield on investment securities improved to in from in the yield on loans decreased to from 
the benefit of prime rate increases in was more than offset by the impact of prepayments and the mortgage securitization 
due to the declining loan yield and the shift in mix towards lower yielding investment securities  the yield on earning assets decreased to from 
average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  in growth in average interest bearing deposits totaled million  or  and was concentrated in money market accounts  the average balance of which increased by million  or 
in the generally low rate environment  and with short term rates increasing for the first time in several years  deposit demand favored money market accounts compared to time certificates of deposit  the average balance of which decreased by million during the year 
now and savings account rates also decreased in the low rate environment 
these changes led to a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits to in  compared to in the prior year 
average borrowings increased by million  or  in as the bank borrowed in a range of targeted maturities from one month to four years to fund asset growth 
the cost of borrowings decreased to from 
these decreases in deposit and borrowing costs both contributed to the decline in the cost of interest bearing liabilities to from 
the reduction in funding costs helped to mitigate the impact of declining asset yields 
additionally  the decrease in the net interest margin reflected the higher leveraging strategy in also contributing to this change was a million investment in a bank owned life insurance boli contract  shifting earnings on this amount from interest income to non interest income 
the bank benefited from a million  or  increase in average non interest bearing demand deposit accounts 
the bank s relationship oriented promotional strategies has resulted in the growth of these attractive balances 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was million in  an increase of  or  from the provision measured of net loan charge offs in this measurement was in due primarily to the reversal of about million of previously provided loan loss provision subsequent to the sale of the remaining sub prime automobile loan portfolio in december

the primary source of funding for the company is dividend payments from the bank 
additional sources of liquidity are proceeds from borrowings and capital offerings 
the main uses of liquidity are the payment of stockholder dividends  purchases of treasury stock  and debt service on outstanding debentures 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends as discussed in the stockholders equity note to the consolidated financial statements 
the bank s primary source of liquidity is customer deposits 
additional sources are borrowings  repayments of loans and investment securities  and the sale and repayments of investment securities 
the bank closely monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis 
sources of borrowings include advances from the fhlbb and a repurchase agreement line of credit with a nationally recognized broker dealer 
the greatest sources of uncertainty affecting liquidity are deposit withdrawals and usage of loan commitments  which are influenced by interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the bank relies on competitive rates  customer service  and long standing relationships with customers to manage deposit and loan liquidity 
based on its historical experience  management believes that it has adequately provided for deposit and loan liquidity needs 
the bank must satisfy various regulatory capital requirements  which are discussed in the regulation and supervision section of item and in the stockholders equity note to the consolidated financial statements 
at year end  the company was engaged in its seventh stock repurchase program as further described in item please see the equity section of the discussion of financial condition for additional information about liquidity and capital at year end contractual obligations

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the company s financial instruments 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
a further presentation of the company s off balance sheet arrangements is presented in footnote  off balance sheet activities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for  the company did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operation or cash flows 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of berkshire bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on berkshire bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations 
impact of new accounting pronouncements please refer to the note on recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the bank seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the loan and investment committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the earnings of berkshire bank 
the bank has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 

back to index quantitative aspects of market risk 
berkshire hills uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that an instantaneous increase or decrease of market interest rates would cause assuming a simultaneous parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
loans  deposits and borrowings are expected to reprice at the new repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
the model includes the effects of on balance sheet derivative instruments acquired by woronoco for the purpose of interest rate risk management 
the results of those simulations for the next twelve months are shown below change in interest rates basis net interest income points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands at december  static at december  static the model indicates that the bank was modestly liability sensitive to a rate shock at year end  compared to a modest asset sensitivity at year end this change was primarily due to the woronoco acquisition and to the impact of higher interest rates on optionality in the balance sheet 
this sensitivity is generally reduced in a more likely ramp scenario in which rates gradually change over a one year period 
the modeled sensitivities are within the bank s risk management parameters 
the reduction in net interest income in the event of a basis point downward shock was due to deposit pricing floors incorporated into the model 
due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  these computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change as follows now accounts ranging between and depending on product type  money market accounts ranging between and depending on the balance and product type  and savings accounts 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it focuses on a rate shock  versus more gradual ramped changes  and that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
a key interest rate change in was the flattening of the yield curve  which generated downward pressure on net interest income 
the model assumptions about deposit rate sensitivity in were as follows now accounts  money market accounts ranging between and depending on the balance  and savings accounts 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
