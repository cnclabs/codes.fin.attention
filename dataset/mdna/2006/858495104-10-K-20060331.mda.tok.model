item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in thousands introduction the following discussion provides an assessment of the results of our operations and liquidity and capital resources together with a brief description of certain accounting policies 
accordingly  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this report 
overview we  through our operating subsidiaries  are one of the world s leading manufacturers of musical instruments 
our strategy is to capitalize on our strong brand names  leading market positions  strong distribution networks  and quality products 
piano segment sales of our pianos are influenced by general economic conditions  demographic trends and general interest in music and the arts 
the operating results of our piano segment are primarily affected by steinway sons grand piano sales 
given the total number of these pianos that we sell in any year  sold in  a slight change in units sold can have a material impact on our business and operating results 
our results are also influenced by sales of boston and essex pianos  which together represented over of total piano units sold but less than of total piano revenues in our boston and essex piano lines are manufactured in asia  each by a single manufacturer 
the ability of these manufacturers to produce and ship products to us could impact our business and operating results 
in  approximately of piano sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in asia 
for the year ended december   our piano segment sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
piano outlook for overall  we expect a relatively stable year for our piano segment with respect to sales and gross profit 
we intend to focus on reducing existing inventory levels  developing our distribution structure in china and implementing various manufacturing improvement initiatives in the upcoming year 
we currently have sufficient  but not excessive  manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated or increased demand 
band segment our student band instrument sales are influenced by trends in school enrollment  general attitudes toward music and the arts  and our ability to provide competitively priced products to our dealer network 
management estimates that of our domestic band sales are generated through educational programs  the remainder is sales to amateur or professional musicians or performing groups  including symphonies and orchestras 
our sales growth has been adversely affected in recent years by the abundance of competitively priced imported student instruments available to our dealers and their ability to purchase these products directly from offshore sources 
in order to compete with these mass merchandised offshore instruments  we restructured our product offerings to include quality  competitively priced brand name imported instruments that are built to our specifications 
we now offer quality controlled  brand name products at multiple price points through distribution channels which support the music education market 
our product offerings are tailored to the needs of traditional school music dealers who provide full service rental programs to beginning band students  as well as music retailers and e commerce dealers selling directly to end consumers from their stores or through the internet 
we believe our product offerings have helped us remain competitive at various price points and will continue to do so in the future 
in  beginner instruments accounted for approximately of band orchestral unit shipments and approximately of band instrument revenues  with advanced and professional instruments representing the balance 
in  approximately of band sales were in the united states  in europe and the remaining primarily in canada and asia 
for the year ended december   our band sales were million  representing of our total revenues 
band outlook for we are entering with increased orders for both us made and sourced products and expect to see improvement in both revenues and gross profit in the coming year 
focused sales efforts have resulted in an expanding customer base in the u 
s  particularly for percussion instruments  and in our export markets 
we are working more closely with our customers to understand their requirements so we may improve the coordination of product availability with their needs 
we expect continued improvement in the flow of sourced product from our suppliers as we monitor their capacity 
our efforts to improve productivity at our various facilities should continue to yield more efficient production levels 
this  coupled with an increase in sales of sourced products  should lead to improved margins in inflation and foreign currency impact although we cannot accurately predict the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or results of operations in recent years 
sales to customers outside the united states represented of consolidated sales in we record sales in euro  japanese yen  british pounds  and chinese yuan 
in  we generated of our international sales through our piano segment 
foreign exchange rate changes impacted sales by less than million in the current year 
although currency fluctuation affects international sales  it also affects cost of sales and related operating expenses 
consequently  it generally has not had a material impact on operating income 
we use financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and currency options to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on firm and anticipated cash flow exposures and certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the affected division 
we do not purchase currency related financial instruments for purposes other than exchange rate risk management 
taxes we are subject to us income taxes as well as tax in several foreign jurisdictions in which we do business 
some of these foreign jurisdictions have higher statutory rates than the united states 
in addition  certain of our operations are subject to both us and foreign taxes 
however  in such cases we receive a credit against our us taxes for foreign taxes paid equal to the percentage that such foreign income as adjusted for reallocated interest represents of the total income subject to us tax 
accordingly  our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to us income and the absorption of foreign tax credits in the united states 
in  we were able to utilize foreign tax credits carried forward from prior years due to the higher proportion of our foreign source income to overall income 
in  we were able to use the majority  but not all  of the foreign tax credits generated in that period 
however  because the american jobs creation act of the act extended the foreign tax credit carryover period  we were able to recognize a partial benefit for the excess foreign tax credits generated in in  we were unable to utilize approximately one third of the foreign tax credits generated in the current period 
this  coupled with the income generated in higher rate jurisdictions such as germany  resulted in an increase in our overall tax rate in the current year 
the strengthening of our domestic piano and band businesses is expected to result in less effective use of our foreign tax credits and credit carryforwards in the upcoming year 
we also anticipate higher pretax income in many of the states in which we do business 
these events may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate for our overall tax rate will also be influenced by our ability to effectively use losses generated in certain tax jurisdictions 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year change for the years ended december  net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization total operating expenses income from operations other income  net net interest expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview in we continued strengthening our band business 
our purchase of substantially all of the assets of g 
leblanc corporation in august resulted in sales growth for the segment 
we merged the administrative office operations of leblanc into our existing operations in may  thereby eliminating duplicative administrative costs 
production at our woodwind facility  which was low in the early part of the year as we trained new workers  had significantly improved by the end of the period  and we continue to experience period over period improvement in our band segment margins 
our domestic piano division sales decreased due to unusually high turnover in sales personnel at the retail level  coupled with decreased demand for our boston piano lines 
however  overall piano segment sales remained stable  primarily due to the revenue generated by our european divisions 
piano margins declined slightly due to inefficiencies at both piano manufacturing facilities 
net sales net sales increased million as a result of the increase in band division sales  which was caused primarily by incremental sales of leblanc product through the first three quarters of overall band unit shipments increased  due to the increase in brass and woodwind unit shipments of the largest component of the band business 
total piano sales remained stable at million 
domestically  sales declined  in part due to attrition of retail sales staff in the early part of the year  as well as the decrease in unit shipments of our boston piano lines 
in the us  mid and lower priced piano sales are being adversely impacted by the influx of low priced asian imports 
however  the shift in mix towards higher priced units sold by our german division resulted in consistent piano segment revenues 
gross profit gross profit improved million driven by an increase in band sales and band margins 
band margins were less affected by atypical charges in the current period 
these costs totaled million in  and arose from the sell through of purchased leblanc inventory  which was written up to fair value upon acquisition 
in the prior period  atypical charges totaled million  comprised of million from the sell through of purchased leblanc inventory  and million from severance costs associated with plant closures 
band margins also benefited from a large  high margin sales transaction in the beginning of the fourth quarter 
piano segment gross profit decreased million despite the beneficial sales mix towards higher margin grands sold by our german division 
the adverse impact of factory inefficiencies due in part to the disruptions caused by implementing production line improvements  as well as a larger book to physical inventory adjustment at our domestic piano manufacturing facility were the primary causes of the piano margin decrease 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million  despite the decrease in external costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  which were approximately million less in the incremental operating expenses are primarily sales and marketing  million of which resulted from commissions associated with the large sales transaction described above 
piano sales commissions also increased as a result of the favorable performance by the german division 
in addition  this division had incremental public relations and advertising costs of million as a result of its th anniversary celebrations 
lastly  million in additional operating expenses were associated with leblanc  and were incurred in the early part of the year  prior to the consolidation of band administrative offices 
non operating expenses non operating expenses increased million in approximately million of this increase relates to losses on extinguishment of debt  which resulted from the buyback of million of our senior notes at  and the write off of the corresponding deferred financing costs 
a shift of million from foreign exchange gains to foreign exchange losses also contributed to the expense increase 
we incurred additional interest costs of approximately million due to the increase in interest rates during the year 
the remainder of the expense increase primarily results from reclassification of certain items from non operating expenses to operating expenses 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year change for years ended december  net sales band piano total sales cost of sales band piano total cost of sales gross profit band piano total gross profit operating expenses facility rationalization total operating expenses income from operations other income  net net interest expense income before income taxes income tax provision net income overview was a year committed to improvement of our band business 
we continued the facility rationalization project started in  closing one of our elkhart  indiana plants in april and moving production into existing facilities 
our redesigned distribution policy enabled us to grow our e commerce  catalog  music retailer  professional  and export sales categories 
our expanded product line  which includes lower priced  brand name sourced instruments  has been well accepted in the marketplace  and we experienced increases in sales of these products once we worked through product availability issues 
however  we maintained lower than normal production levels for certain products in order to manage inventory levels  which adversely impacted margins 
we were presented with the opportunity to purchase substantially all of the assets of g 
leblanc corporation  which enabled us to strengthen our existing band product lines 
leblanc faced the same excess capacity issues we have experienced  having announced the closure of one of its manufacturing facilities just prior to the acquisition 
accordingly  we expect our overall production rationalization activities to extend beyond the timeframe originally anticipated as we factor leblanc s production capabilities into our analysis 
our piano business had a very successful year 
domestic wholesale sales remained strong  and retail sales were bolstered by the two additional retail stores that were fully operational for all of our european business remained stable  while our asian business improved  primarily due to our shanghai facility being operational since spring although sales and marketing expenses were higher than expected  these costs were more than offset by margin improvements due to improved production levels  efficiencies  and product mix 
net sales net sales increased million 
this resulted in part from a increase in steinway grand unit shipments  as well as a million benefit attributable to foreign exchange 
the total piano sales increase of million also reflects the increase in higher priced retail unit sales resulting from our additional domestic storefronts being operational for the full year  as well as strong wholesale shipments throughout the year 
band orchestral instrument sales increased million on an overall unit increase of 
the band sales increase includes million attributable to the leblanc acquisition  with the remainder resulting from core business growth  especially professional brass and percussion instruments 
gross profit gross profit improved million primarily due to the piano margin improvement from to 
higher domestic production levels  overseas production and labor efficiencies  and improved retail sales were the primary driver of the increase 
a shift in our international divisions sales mix towards higher margin grands sold also contributed to the improvement 
although band segment gross profit improved million  gross margins declined slightly 
atypical charges affecting margin in totaled million  comprised primarily of severance and higher costs associated with the acquisition write up of leblanc inventory to fair value 
in  atypical charges totaled million  including severance costs  strike costs  and inventory impairment charges 
despite the reduction in atypical charges and improved margins on imported student products  gross margins decreased slightly from to 
this was primarily due to increased freight expenses  production inefficiencies for some woodwind products  and reduced production levels of certain brass instruments 
significant increases in costs of raw materials such as silver and copper also adversely affected band gross margins 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million despite the million decrease in impairment charges taken in the prior year 
over million of this increase resulted from external costs associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance project 
million of the increase is attributable to foreign exchange  and we incurred incremental expenses of million associated with leblanc 
the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from increased advertising and promotional costs and increased bonus payments 
non operating expenses non operating expenses increased million primarily due to the additional interest expense resulting from our issuance of million of senior notes in february liquidity and capital resources we have relied primarily upon cash provided by operations  supplemented as necessary by seasonal borrowings under our domestic working capital line  to finance our operations  repay long term indebtedness  finance acquisitions  and fund our capital expenditures 
our overseas divisions  particularly in asia  are normally in a borrowing position on their lines 
these borrowings are likely to be less than million at any given time 
in  our domestic line went virtually unused for the year  in  our borrowings peaked at approximately million  as a result of our acquisition of the net assets of leblanc  and in our borrowings peaked at approximately million due to seasonal borrowings 
cash flows our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  net income changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net income to cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities in  cash flows from operating activities increased million despite the increase in cash used for accounts payable of million 
this improvement was largely due to the increase in cash provided by inventory and receivables of million  which resulted from improved management of work in process inventory and receivables collections at our band division 
in  cash flows from operating activities decreased million 
this resulted primarily from working capital changes  as inventory increased in part to support our expansion in asia  and receivables increased in conjunction with band sales increases 
collectively  these working capital changes used million more than in the prior period 
cash transferred to workers compensation and environmental depositary trust funds which replaced more expensive letters of credit previously used also negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities 
in  cash flows from operating activities of million were driven by our control over inventory  reduced manufacturing levels  and management of our accounts receivable and payable 
the use of cash for investing activities decreased million  as million was used to fund our acquisition of leblanc in in  cash used for acquisitions was limited to the million final purchase price adjustment for leblanc 
capital expenditures were slightly lower than in prior periods at million in  million in  and million in see capital expenditures discussion below 
the remainder of the decrease is due to the proceeds from sales of fixed assets  which provided an incremental million in the period 
in  cash flows from financing activities decreased million due in part to the million decrease in proceeds from issuance of stock 
in addition  we repaid approximately million on our line borrowings in the current year  whereas borrowings provided cash of million in the prior period 
lastly  in december  we repurchased million of our own senior notes at of face value  which resulted in a use of cash of million 
in  cash provided by financing activities of million resulted from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activities totaling million  which more than offset the million in net borrowings and scheduled debt repayments 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of scheduled debt repayments of million  counterbalanced in part by net borrowings of million on our foreign lines of credit 
these borrowings were made primarily to support an increase in working capital 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures consist primarily of machinery and equipment upgrades and replacements  facility upgrades  and telephone and computer system enhancements 
we expect capital spending in to be in the range of million  relating to plant improvements  production equipment purchases  and facility improvements 
seasonality consistent with industry practice  we sell band instruments almost entirely on credit utilizing the two financing programs described below 
due to these programs  we have large working capital requirements during certain times of the year when band instrument receivable balances reach highs of approximately million in august and september  and lesser requirements when they are at lows of approximately million in january and february 
the financing options  intended to assist dealers with the seasonality inherent in the industry and facilitate the rent to own programs offered to students by many retailers  also allow us to match our production and delivery schedules 
the following forms of financing are offered to qualified band instrument dealers a receivable dating payments on purchases made from october through august of the following year are due in october 
dealers are offered discounts for early payment 
b note receivable financing dealers that meet certain credit qualifications may convert open accounts to a note payable to us 
the note program is offered primarily in october and coincides with the receivable dating program 
the terms of the notes generally include payment over a nine to twelve month period with interest ranging from 
interest rates are contingent upon credit ratings and borrowing periods 
in certain situations  long term arrangements for up to months may be offered 
in most instances  the note receivable is secured by dealer inventories and receivables 
off balance sheet arrangements in  certain customers of our leblanc subsidiary financed notes receivable with a third party  to which we have a recourse obligation 
as of december   million of these notes remain outstanding 
we have included a corresponding recourse obligation of million in our financial statements at period end 
our total maximum recourse obligation under this arrangement includes the outstanding balance on the notes  as well as any interest or late fees that may be incurred by our customers 
we generally do not provide extended financing arrangements to our piano dealers 
to facilitate long term financing required by some dealers  we have arranged financing through third party providers 
we generally provide no guarantees with respect to these arrangements 
retail financing obligations certain of our retail sales overseas were financed by our customers through a local bank under an arrangement that included an obligation on our part to repurchase pianos seized by the bank upon default of the customer 
the buyback price is established as a percentage of the original sales price  starting at in the first year and declining to in the fifth year of the loan 
this program ceased in the first quarter of nevertheless  because our obligation continues until the bank is paid in full by the customer  our commitment can remain outstanding for up to years the maximum term of the consumer loan 
our maximum obligation under this arrangement is estimated to be approximately million million at the december  exchange rate 
to date  we have not been required to repurchase any pianos under this program and we believe the likelihood of such repurchases in the future is remote 
accordingly  we have not recognized a liability for this obligation in our financial statements 
further  in the unlikely event of a repurchase  we believe the proceeds received upon our resale of the piano would exceed the amount payable to the bank 
pensions and other postretirement benefits when determining the amounts to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to our domestic pension and other postretirement benefits  we used a long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was developed with input from our actuaries and our investment committee  and is consistent with prior years 
we believe that is consistent with the historical long term return trends on our domestic pension assets and our expectations for future returns 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations for our domestic plans is based on long term bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency 
the resulting discount rate decreased from at december  to at december  the discount rates and rates of returns on plan assets for our foreign pension and other postretirement benefit plans were similarly developed utilizing long term rates of return and discount rates reasonably expected to occur in the applicable jurisdiction 
borrowing activities and availability our real estate term loan  acquisition term loan  and domestic  seasonal borrowing requirements are accommodated through a committed credit facility with a syndicate of domestic lenders the credit facility 
the credit facility provides us with a potential borrowing capacity of million in revolving credit loans  and expires on september  borrowings are collateralized by our domestic accounts receivable  inventory  and fixed assets 
as of december   there were no revolving credit loans outstanding and availability based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances was approximately million  net of letters of credit 
the real estate term loan is payable in monthly installments of million and includes interest at average day libor at december  plus 
this term loan is secured by all of our interests in the steinway hall property 
the acquisition term loan was repayable in monthly installments of million through august and monthly installments of million from september through september the acquisition term loan and revolving credit loans bear interest at average day libor plus 
subsequent to year end  the acquisition term loan was paid in full 
all of our borrowings under the credit facility are secured by a first lien on our domestic inventory  receivables  and fixed assets 
open account loans with german banks also provide for borrowings of up to million million at december  by steinway s foreign subsidiaries 
an additional revolving loan provides borrowing capacity of up to million million at the december  exchange rate 
on april   we issued million senior notes due in december we repurchased million of our senior notes at 
in december we repurchased million of our senior notes at 
in february we purchased  shares of our ordinary common stock directly from our then largest institutional shareholder 
in exchange  we issued million in principal amount of our senior notes due under the existing indenture 
we issued these bonds at a premium of 
this transaction increased our treasury stock by million 
at december   our total outstanding indebtedness amounted to million  consisting of million of senior notes  million on the real estate term loan  million on the acquisition term loan  and million of notes payable to foreign banks 
cash interest paid was million in  million in  and million in all of our debt agreements contain covenants that place certain restrictions on us  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make investments in other entities and to pay cash dividends 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  and do not anticipate any compliance issues in our bond indenture contains limitations  based on net income among other things  on the amount of discretionary repurchases we may make of our ordinary common stock 
our intent and ability to repurchase additional ordinary common stock either directly from shareholders or on the open market is directly affected by this limitation 
we have reserved  shares of our existing treasury stock to be utilized for the exercise of outstanding stock options under our amended and restated stock plan 
these options have no impact on our cash flow or the number of shares outstanding unless and until the options are exercised 
we experience long production and inventory turnover cycles  which we constantly monitor since fluctuations in demand can have a significant impact on these cycles 
we were able to effectively utilize cash flow from operations to fund our debt and capital requirements and paid off our seasonal borrowings on our domestic line of credit 
looking forward to  we anticipate that both our piano and band divisions will perform consistently throughout the period 
our intention is to keep our balance sheet strong by managing accounts receivable  working to reduce inventory levels  and repaying debt 
other than the restructuring of our long term debt as described below  we do not have any current plans or intentions that will have a material impact on our liquidity in  although we may consider acquisitions that may require funding from operations or from our credit facilities 
other than those described  we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  or costs of resources that are expected to materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
accordingly  we believe that cash on hand  together with cash flows anticipated from operations and available borrowings under the credit facility  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  fund continuing capital requirements and satisfy our working capital and general corporate needs through recent events on february   we repaid our acquisition term loan  which had an outstanding balance of million as of december  as a result of the write off of associated deferred financing costs  we recorded a loss of million on extinguishment of this debt in the first quarter of on february  we completed a million offering of senior notes at of face value  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
we used million of the proceeds to redeem million of our senior notes including accrued interest and associated premiums pursuant to our tender offer to repurchase these notes 
the early retirement of these notes will generate a net loss on extinguishment of million in the first quarter 
this net loss is comprised primarily of million of tender and consent premiums paid to bondholders  as the million of loss on write off of deferred financing costs is essentially offset by the million of gain recorded due to our write off of the bond premium associated with the pre existing senior notes 
we shall use the remainder of the proceeds from issuance of the senior notes  supplemented by cash on hand  to pay outstanding debt issuance costs  such as legal fees  and to redeem the remaining million of senior notes  which we have called at plus accrued interest 
the early retirement of these remaining notes  which will occur in april  will generate a loss on extinguishment of million 
this loss is comprised of million of call premiums paid to bondholders and million due to the write off of the remaining deferred financing costs associated with the senior notes 
we will record interest on both the senior notes and the senior notes for the february april timeframe during which both series of notes are outstanding 
this duplicate interest expense will be offset in part by interest income on the unused debt issuance proceeds and is not expected to be material to the financial statements 
once the duplicate interest period has passed  we expect interest payment savings of approximately million per year 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total notes to contractual obligations long term debt represents long term debt obligations  the fixed interest on our notes  and the variable interest on our other loans 
we estimated the future variable interest obligation using the applicable december  rates 
the nature of our long term debt obligations is described more fully in the borrowing availability and activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
changes to our long term debt structure which occurred subsequent to december  are described in the recent events section of liquidity and capital resources 
approximately million of our operating lease obligations are attributable to the ninety nine year land lease associated with the purchase of steinway hall  which is described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  the remainder is attributable to the leasing of other facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations consist of firm purchase commitments for raw materials  finished goods  and equipment 
our other long term liabilities consist primarily of the long term portion of our pension obligations  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included within this filing  and obligations under employee and consultant agreements  which are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within this filing 
critical accounting estimates the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following estimates to be critical based on the definition above 
accounts receivable we establish reserves for accounts receivable and notes receivable including recourse reserves when our customers have financed notes receivable with a third party 
we review overall collectibility trends and customer characteristics such as debt leverage  solvency  and outstanding balances in order to develop our reserve estimates 
inventory we establish inventory reserves for items such as lower of cost or market and obsolescence 
we review inventory levels on a detailed basis  concentrating on the age and amounts of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods  as well as recent usage and sales dates and quantities to help develop our estimates 
we also establish reserves for anticipated book to physical adjustments based upon our historical level of adjustments from our annual physical inventories 
we cost our inventory using standard costs 
accordingly  variances between actual and standard that are not abnormal in nature are capitalized into inventory and released based on calculated inventory turns 
workers compensation and self insured health claims we establish workers compensation and self insured health claims reserves based on our trend analysis of data provided by third party administrators regarding historical claims and anticipated future claims 
warranty we establish reserves for warranty claims based on our analysis of historical claims data  recent claims trends  and the various lengths of time for which we warranty our products 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
we test our goodwill and indefinite lived trademark assets for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset may have decreased below its carrying value 
our assessment is based on several analyses  including multi year cash flows and comparison of estimated fair values to our market capitalization 
pensions and other post retirement benefit costs we make certain assumptions when calculating our benefit obligations and expenses 
we base our selection of assumptions  such as discount rates and long term rates of return  on information provided by our actuaries and investment committee  current rate trends  and historical trends for our pension asset portfolio 
our benefit obligations and expenses can fluctuate significantly based on the assumptions management selects 
deferred income taxes a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards 
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized 
the ultimate realization of these assets is dependent upon many factors  including the ratio of foreign source income to overall income and generation of sufficient future taxable income in the states for which we have loss carryforwards 
when establishing or adjusting valuation allowances  we consider these factors  as well as anticipated trends in foreign source income and tax planning strategies which may impact future realizability of these assets 
environmental liabilities we make certain assumptions when calculating our environmental liabilities 
we base our assumptions  such as cost and length of time for remediation  on data provided by our environmental consultants  as well as information provided by regulatory authorities 
we also make certain assumptions regarding the indemnifications we have received from others  including whether costs are within the scope of the indemnification  the indemnifier s ability to perform under the agreement  and whether past claims have been successful 
our environmental obligations and expenses can fluctuate significantly based on management s assumptions 
we believe the assumptions made by management provide a reasonable basis for the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this accounting standard  which is effective beginning january   requires the recognition of compensation cost related to stock options using the fair value method 
we will adopt sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective application method 
based on current outstanding awards  expected participation in the purchase plan consistent with past patterns  and no significant changes in the number of shares of outstanding stock  we anticipate an impact on basic earnings per share of approximately from additional stock compensation expense in the actual amount will be impacted by changes in the aforementioned factors  as well as finalization of our estimated forfeiture rates and other assumptions 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

this accounting standard  which is effective for annual periods beginning after june   requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for early retirement programs with specific features such as terms specified in altersteilzeit early retirement arrangements  which addresses the accounting for the transitional early retirement program in germany 
salary components of this plan should be recognized over the period from which the program begins until the end of the active service period 
additionally  a portion of the salary that is deferred under certain arrangements should be discounted if payment is expected to be deferred for a period longer than one year 
this treatment is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the application of eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we mitigate some of our cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by holding forward foreign currency contracts 
these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
the contracts relate primarily to intercompany transactions and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   a negative change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by less than million 
gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts are defined as the difference between the contract rate at its inception date and the current forward rate 
however  we would offset any such gains and losses by corresponding losses and gains  respectively  on the related asset or liability 
interest risk our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
the credit facility and term loans bear interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in libor or similar indices 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately million 
our long term debt includes million of senior notes with a fixed interest rate 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on our interest expense associated with these notes due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
however  based on a hypothetical immediate decrease in market interest rates  the fair value of our senior notes  which would be sensitive to such interest rate changes  would be increased by approximately million as of december
