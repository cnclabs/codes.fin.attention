item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail in kansas and at wholesale in a multi state region in the central united states under the regulation of the kcc and ferc 
in management s discussion and analysis  we discuss our general financial condition  significant changes that occurred during  and our operating results for the years ended december   and as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which contain our operating results 
summary of significant items overview several significant items have impacted us and our business operations since january  we filed applications with the kcc on may  for an increase in our retail electric rates 
effective january  the kcc authorized changes in our rates that left our rates virtually unchanged and approved various other changes in our rate structure 
see retail rate review below for additional information 
we incurred approximately million in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to restore our electric distribution system as a result of a severe ice storm that occurred in january as allowed by the december  kcc order  we will begin to recover these costs in rates in coal delivery issues caused our coal inventory levels to decline significantly below desired levels  which required us to rely on more expensive sources of power to meet our customers energy needs 
wholesale sales volumes have declined and could continue to decline due to the cost and availability of fuel and growing demands of our retail customers 
the cost of fuel and purchased power has increased significantly as discussed in more detail below in increasing cost of fuel and purchased power 
retail rate review december  kcc order in accordance with a kcc order  we filed applications with the kcc on may  to review our rates 
we requested an increase in our retail electric rates and the adoption of other practices under the kcc s jurisdiction 
while the kcc ordered a net increase in our base rates of million annually  the increase is substantially offset by the requirement that we credit to retail customers a rolling three year average of the margins we realize from our market based wholesale sales 
other significant changes approved by the kcc are the reca  the ecrr  the separation of transmission delivery charges  an increase in annual depreciation expense  an extended recovery period for costs being recovered for which no return is provided and the recovery of various costs that have been incurred and deferred as regulatory assets 

table of contents retail energy cost adjustment the reca allows us to recover the actual cost of fuel consumed in producing electricity and the cost of purchased power 
the adjustment is based on the actual cost of fuel and purchased power less margins from market based wholesale sales 
we have contracts with certain large industrial customers  the terms of which do not provide for the separate billing of fuel costs 
fuel costs for these customers will continue to be recovered through the rates specified in each of these contracts 
these customers represented approximately of our total retail sales volumes for wholesale sales margins the terms of the reca require that we include  as a credit to recoverable fuel costs  an amount based on the average of the margins realized from market based wholesale sales during the immediately prior three year period 
in any period we are unable to realize market based wholesale sales margins at least equal to the amount of the credit  our financial results would be adversely affected 
in the short term  our generating capacity is fixed while the load requirements of our customers change constantly 
when our generating capacity is not needed to serve our customers  we attempt to seek out wholesale sales of energy at prices in excess of the costs of production 
we are likely to face the prospect of decreasing margins as the energy demands of our retail customers increase  which may result in crediting to retail customers an amount that would exceed the margins realized in the current period 
environmental cost recovery rider the ecrr allows for the timely inclusion in rates  without requiring a full rate review  of the capital expenditures made to upgrade our equipment to meet stricter environmental standards required by the clean air act 
prior to collection through rates  the kcc will review any environmental expenditures to be considered for recovery under the ecrr 
any increased operating and maintenance costs that result from updating or adding environmental equipment cannot be recovered through the ecrr 
these costs would be addressed in future rate reviews 
transmission delivery charge the december  kcc order allows us to separate our transmission costs from our base rates charged to retail customers 
this allows us to implement a formula transmission rate that provides for annual adjustments to reflect changes in our transmission costs  which provides for adjustment on a more timely basis 
these rates were proposed in an application filed with ferc on may  and became effective on december   subject to refund upon review and approval by ferc 
depreciation rates the december  kcc order authorized an annual increase in the recovery of depreciation expense of approximately million 
the approved change in depreciation rates allows for the inclusion of net salvage costs  which include an estimate for the cost of dismantlement of plant facilities 
disallowed plant costs in  the kcc disallowed certain costs associated with the original construction of wolf creek 
in  the kcc authorized kge to recover these costs in rates over the original depreciable life of wolf creek  or through  but disallowed any return on these costs 
in its december  order  the kcc extended the recovery period to correspond to wolf creek s new estimated depreciable life 
kge recognized a loss of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the decrease in the present value of amounts to be received due to the extension of the recovery period 
other regulatory assets the december  kcc order also approved for recovery approximately million of deferred maintenance costs associated with restoring utility service to our customers stemming from damage to our lines and equipment in the ice storms that occurred in and and various other expenses that are relatively small in relation to the total regulatory asset balance 
increasing cost of fuel and purchased power the cost of power is impacted by  among other factors  customer demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity and operating constraints 
higher fuel and purchased power costs  unit outages  and operating constraints  such as our efforts to conserve coal  increased our total fuel and purchased power costs 

table of contents cost of fuel and purchased power the cost of fossil fuel has increased since this is especially true for the cost of natural gas and oil 
this higher cost of fuel affects not only the cost of fuel we burn  but also increases the market prices for both our wholesale sales and purchases of power 
the cost and availability of fuel may cause us to use higher priced fuel types or to purchase power to meet our customers energy needs 
the effects of the fuel price increases are reflected in our operating results 
fuel supply contracts we have a net gain position on our coal supply contract for our lawrence and tecumseh energy centers 
the gain position results primarily from an increase in the price of coal from the prb region of wyoming 
based on the terms of this contract  changes in the fair value of this contract are marked to market in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
as a result of the december  kcc order implementing the reca  we reversed previously recognized adjustments to fuel expense of million related to mark to market adjustments and established a regulatory liability 
going forward  we will recognize changes in the fair value of fuel supply contracts as regulatory assets or liabilities 
unit availability our operating results are significantly influenced by the availability of our generating units 
if our more economical units are not available  we must rely on more expensive sources of power to meet our load requirements 
the primary outages during the year ended december  were the scheduled refueling and maintenance outage and an unplanned outage at wolf creek and planned and unplanned outages at jeffrey energy center and la cygne 
the primary outages during the year ended december  were the planned and unplanned outages and reduced availability of jeffrey energy center 
operating constraints our operating results are influenced by operating constraints on our generating units  such as coal conservation and maintenance outages 
if our more economical units are constrained  we must rely on more expensive sources of power to meet our load requirements and or forego opportunities in the wholesale power market 
during the year ended december   coal conservation efforts  at times  reduced the energy generated at our more economical units and contributed to the decline in our market based wholesale sales volumes 
coal conservation was required as a result of slower than expected coal deliveries  as discussed below 
coal inventory and delivery coal deliveries from the prb region of wyoming were slower than expected due primarily to problems with the rail tracks used to deliver our coal and operational problems at the mines where the coal is obtained 
nearly all of the coal used in our coal fired generating stations is from the prb region of wyoming 
during  we implemented compensating measures based on delivery cycle times  our assumptions about future delivery cycle times  fuel usage and planned inventory levels 
these measures included  but were not limited to  reducing coal consumption during off peak periods by revising normal operational dispatch of our generating units  purchasing power or using more expensive power to serve customers  decreasing wholesale sales  transferring rail cars between or among our power plants and purchasing and leasing additional rail cars 
these actions helped to reduce the financial impact resulting from longer delivery cycle times 
the effect of the reduction in sales due to slower coal deliveries has been partially offset by higher prices received for the power we have sold in the power markets 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of matters to change 

table of contents regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards for our regulated utility operations that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities represent probable obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred in the future 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific orders from the kcc  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
to the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed probable  related regulatory assets would be required to be expensed in current period earnings 
pension and post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension benefit plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on future costs  which may be reflected as an increase or decrease in net income in the current and future periods  or on the amount of related liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets or may also require cash contributions 
the following table shows the annual impact of a change in our pension plan discount rate  salary scale and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual change in projected benefit obligation annual change in pension liability asset annual increase in projected pension expense in thousands discount rate decrease    increase    salary scale decrease    increase    rate of return on plan assets decrease  increase  we recorded pension expense of approximately million in  million in and pension income of approximately million in pension expense for is expected to approximate million  which represents an million increase over the increase is primarily due to the amortization of investment losses from prior years that are recognized on a rolling four year average basis and changes in assumptions including a lower discount rate  lower return on assets  increase in salary scale and updated mortality tables 

table of contents the following table shows the annual impact of a change in our post retirement benefit plan discount rate and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual increase in projected benefit obligation annual increase in projected post retirement expense in thousands discount rate decrease  increase  rate of return on plan assets decrease increase revenue recognition energy sales we recognize revenues from retail energy sales upon delivery to the customer and include an estimate for energy delivered but unbilled 
our estimate of revenue attributable to this unbilled portion is based on the total energy available for sale measured against billed sales 
at december   we had estimated unbilled revenue of million 
we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of fuel contracts  we include the net mark to market change in sales on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the resulting unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data are available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
prices used to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of fair values of our trading positions 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial results 
the tables below show fair value of energy marketing contracts outstanding for the year ended december   their sources and maturity periods 
fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding at december  contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period a fair value of new contracts entered into during the period fair value of contracts outstanding at december  a changes in the fair value of fuel supply contracts  approximately million  are recognized as a regulatory liability 

table of contents the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts are summarized in the following table 
fair value of contracts at end of period sources of fair value total fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years in thousands prices actively quoted futures prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on the black option pricing model options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a the black option pricing model is a variant of the black scholes option pricing model 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties 
we record deferred tax assets for capital loss  operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are not sufficient sources of future capital gain income or taxable income to realize the benefit of the capital loss  operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  we reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we recognize a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we report the effect of a change in the valuation allowance in the current period tax expense 
asset retirement obligations we calculate our asset retirement obligations and related costs using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
we estimate our asset retirement obligations based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time the related long lived asset was either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation become effective 
in determining our asset retirement obligations  we make assumptions regarding probable disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our asset retirement obligations reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  for more detailed information 

table of contents operating results we evaluate operating results based on basic earnings per share 
we have various classifications of sales  defined as follows retail sales of energy made to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other retail sales of energy for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenues reserved for rebates 
tariff based wholesale sales of energy to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the rate for which is generally based on cost as prescribed by ferc tariffs 
also includes changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle 
market based wholesale sales of energy to other wholesale customers  the rate for which is based on prevailing market prices as allowed by our ferc approved market based tariff 
also includes changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle 
energy marketing includes market based energy transactions unrelated to our generation or the needs of our regulated customers  financially settled products and physical transactions sourced outside our control area  and changes in valuations for contracts that have yet to settle that may not be recorded in tariff or market based wholesale revenues 
transmission reflects transmission revenues received  including those based on a tariff with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the overall economy of our service area  the weather and competitive forces 
our wholesale sales are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity and transmission availability 
changing weather affects the amount of electricity our customers use 
very hot summers and very cold winters prompt more demand  especially among our residential customers 
mild weather reduces demand 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december  as compared to the results for the year ended december  changes in results of operations are as follows 
year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales tariff based wholesale market based wholesale energy marketing transmission a other total sales operating expenses fuel used for generation purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment earnings loss on extinguishment of debt other income other expense total other income expense interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations results of discontinued operations  net of tax net income preferred dividends earnings available for common stock basic earnings per share a transmission includes an spp network transmission tariff 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million 
this amount  less approximately million that was retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 
the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of megawatt hours mwh of electricity  for the years ended december  and no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to electricity we generate 
change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total 
table of contents residential and commercial sales and sales volumes increased due primarily to warmer weather during than experienced in when measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was warmer than during and above the year average 
we measure cooling degree days at weather stations we believe to be generally reflective of conditions in our service territory 
the warmer weather also contributed to the increased tariff based wholesale sales and sales volumes 
additionally  about million  or approximately  of the increase in the tariff based wholesale sales was due to the wolf creek outages 
we sold more tariff based wholesale power to kepco in accordance with a contract to supply replacement power when wolf creek is not available 
we had more energy available from jeffrey energy center  which also contributed to the increased tariff based wholesale sales 
higher prevailing fuel prices have caused wholesale market prices to increase  which was the primary reason our market based wholesale sales increased 
market based wholesale sales volumes declined because less energy was available for sale due to the increase in retail and tariff based wholesale sales 
the change in energy marketing was due primarily to having more favorable changes in market valuations in compared to and due to favorable settlements of energy contracts in fuel expense increased due primarily to using more expensive sources of generation because of the lower unit availability of our more economical generating units as discussed above in summary of significant items increasing cost of fuel and purchased power unit availability 
purchased power expense increased due primarily to a increase in volumes purchased during as compared to this was due to the various outages or reduced operating capability at some of our generating units and the availability of economically priced power 
at times  it was more economical to purchase power than to operate our available generating units 
also contributing to the increase in purchased power expense was a higher average cost 
operating and maintenance expense increased due to a number of factors  the largest of which was a million write off of disallowed plant costs as discussed above in summary of significant items retail rate review december  kcc order disallowed plant costs 
in addition  costs of operating and maintaining our distribution system increased million due primarily to higher labor costs and additional maintenance projects 
also causing the operating and maintenance expense to increase was higher taxes other than income tax of million  a million charge to write off plant operating system development costs at wolf creek due to non performance of the vendor developing the system and higher maintenance costs at our generating units of million due to the outages as discussed above in unit availability 
these higher expenses were partially offset by a million decline in expense related to changes in the la cygne unit operating lease as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  leases 
depreciation expense decreased primarily because we established a regulatory asset for the depreciation differences between those used for financial statement purposes and regulatory rate making purposes from august to march pursuant to the december  kcc order  which allowed us to record a reduction in depreciation expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due primarily to reduced legal fees and insurance costs 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased employee pension and benefit costs 
during  we recognized a loss of million in connection with the redemption of some of our senior unsecured notes and a loss of million in connection with the redemption of the western resources capital i cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a 
other income during was higher due primarily to million of income from corporate owned life insurance  which was partially offset by higher interest expense associated with borrowings on corporate owned life insurance 

table of contents interest expense decreased during due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates due to the refinancing activities as discussed in detail in liquidity and capital resources below 
the increase in income tax expense reflects the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes 
compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december  as compared to the results for the year ended december  changes in results of operations are as follows 
year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales tariff based wholesale market based wholesale energy marketing transmission a other total sales operating expenses fuel used for generation purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment earnings oneok dividends gain on sale of oneok stock loss on extinguishment of debt and settlement of putable callable notes other income other expense total other expense income interest expense income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations results of discontinued operations  net of tax net income preferred dividends earnings available for common stock basic earnings per share a transmission includes an spp network transmission tariff 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million 
this amount  less million that was retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were approximately million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 

table of contents the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of mwh of electricity  for the years ended december  and no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to electricity we generate 
change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total our retail customers used less energy and our sales decreased because of cooler weather during the summer 
when measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was cooler than during and below the year average 
the accrual for rebates to be paid to customers in and pursuant to the july  kcc order also reduced revenues from retail sales 
during  we accrued million as compared to million accrued during market based wholesale sales increased due primarily to increased sales volumes and an approximate increase in the average price per mwh 
as a result of milder weather  we had additional energy production available for sale at certain times during the year that was not needed to serve our retail and tariff based wholesale customers 
increased sales volumes accounted for approximately million of the increased market based wholesale sales and higher average market prices accounted for approximately million of the increase 
energy marketing sales declined because we had less favorable changes in as compared to the favorable changes in in the settlement and the fair value of positions receiving mark to market accounting treatment 
fuel expense increased due primarily to increases in the cost of fossil fuels  although we used approximately less fuel for generation due to the lower demand caused by the cooler weather and due to unplanned outages or reduced operating capability experienced at some of our generating units at various times throughout the average equivalent availability factor for our system was during compared to in the prior year  due largely to the unavailability of some of our coal fired generating units 
as a result of the cooler weather and the reduced availability of our coal fired generating units  we decreased the amount of coal burned  and consequently reduced our total expense for coal 
however  the cost of natural gas and oil that we used at other generating facilities to compensate for the unplanned outages or reduced operating capability  increased our total fuel expense 
purchased power expense increased due primarily to a increase in volumes purchased during as compared to at times  it was more economical to purchase power than to operate our available generating units 
this was due to unplanned outages or reduced operating capability of our coal fired generating units at certain times  and the availability of economically priced power due to cooler weather in our region 
during  we recorded as an offset to operating and maintenance expense a gain of million on the sale of utility assets 
the absence of a similar offset in accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expense in the remainder of the increase was caused primarily by increased expenses associated with maintenance at jeffrey energy center  increased planned and unplanned unit maintenance at various other generating units  increased maintenance of the distribution system  an increase in taxes other than income tax and an increase in the transmission costs 
during  increased maintenance of our generating units accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
the increase in distribution expenses accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
distribution expenses increased due to increased staffing levels and higher costs associated with the termination of portions of the oneok shared services agreement as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  related party transactions oneok shared services agreement 
the change in taxes other than income tax accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 
an increase in transportation costs accounted for of the increase in operating and maintenance expenses 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to an increase in legal fees  including amounts we were required to advance for fees incurred by david c 
wittig  our former president  chief executive officer and chairman  and douglas t 
lake  our former executive vice president  chief strategic officer and member of the board  related to the defense of criminal charges against them  and fees associated with the pending shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
the total other expense during was due primarily to the loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt 
the total other income during was due primarily to the gain on the sale of our oneok stock and dividends received from oneok in this gain was partially offset by the loss recorded on the extinguishment of debt and the settlement of notes during interest expense decreased in due to lower debt balances and lower interest rates due to refinancing activities as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
income from discontinued operations was million in the results recorded for include the settlement of previously pending issues as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations sale of protection one and protection one europe 
this compares to a loss from discontinued operations of million in financial condition below we discuss significant balance sheet changes at december  compared to december  accounts receivable increased million due primarily to an increase in sales in late compared to late in addition  the amounts of receivables sold under our accounts receivable sales program as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  accounts receivable sales program  decreased million  to million at december   from million at december  inventories and supplies decreased million due primarily to a decline in our coal inventory as discussed above in summary of significant items increasing cost of fuel and purchased power coal inventory and delivery 
net energy marketing contracts increased million  to million at december   from million at december  during  we realized a large increase in the net gain position on fuel supply contracts 
as a result of the december  kcc order granting our request for the reca  we recognized the cumulative mark to market adjustment associated with our coal supply contracts as a regulatory liability of million 
for additional information on the reca and on the mark to market gain on fuel supply contracts  see summary of significant items retail rate review  and summary of significant items increasing cost of fuel and purchased power fuel supply contracts 
our tax receivable balance declined million primarily because we received a cash refund associated with the carry back of our capital loss to regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities  decreased to million at december   from million at december   due primarily to changes that resulted from the december  kcc order 
total regulatory assets increased million due primarily to an increase in debt reacquisition costs associated with the retirement and refinancing of long term debt  maintenance costs recorded in association with an ice storm that occurred in january  an increase in depreciation due to changes authorized by the december  kcc order and the recording of conditional asset retirement obligations 
total regulatory liabilities increased million due primarily to the fuel supply contracts obligation we recorded in december as discussed above  we recorded a regulatory liability of million to recognize the cumulative mark to market adjustments associated with our coal supply contracts

the balance at december  consisted of the million outstanding aggregate principal amount of kge first mortgage bonds that are due in january the balance at december  consisted of million outstanding aggregate principal amount of kge first mortgage bonds that were due in august other current liabilities increased million due primarily to the recognition of a receivable related to the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit as discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings 
long term debt  net of current maturities  decreased million due to various financing transactions and the recognition of million kge first mortgage bonds as a current maturity as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources debt financings 
accrued employee benefits increased million due primarily to the additional minimum pension liability recorded in for additional information  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and wolf creek employee benefit plans 
asset retirement obligations increased million 
in  we determined that we have conditional asset retirement obligations that are within the scope of fin and  as a result  increased our asset retirement obligations by million 
also during  we updated our nuclear decommissioning and dismantlement study 
based upon the results of this study  we revised our estimate of our wolf creek asset retirement obligation and increased our liability by million 
in addition  we recorded million in accretion expense on our asset retirement obligation related to the decommissioning of wolf creek 
these items are discussed in greater detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
total other long term liabilities decreased million due primarily to changes in the operating lease for la cygne unit as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  leases

liquidity and capital resources overview we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund future operations  debt maturities and the payment of dividends from a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity 
our available sources of funds include cash  westar energy s revolving credit facility  our accounts receivable sales program and access to capital markets 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet these cash requirements include  among others  factors affecting sales described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  conditions in the capital markets and compliance with environmental regulations 
capital resources at december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  westar energy has a million revolving credit facility against which million of letters of credit have been issued  leaving million available under this facility 

table of contents at december   we also had million of restricted cash classified as a current asset and million of restricted cash classified as a long term asset  primarily to provide credit security for a prepaid capacity and transmission agreement 
the following table details our restricted cash at december  restricted cash current portion restricted cash long term portion in thousands prepaid capacity and transmission agreement cash held in escrow as required by surety bonds total the westar energy mortgage and the kge mortgage each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that could be issued by each entity 
therefore  we must ensure that we will be able to comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
the westar energy mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on  and of the principal amount of  all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
at december   based on an assumed interest rate of  no additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 
the kge mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on  or of the principal amount of  all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
at december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
westar energy sold approximately million shares of its common stock in for net proceeds of million 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities increased million to million in from million in during  we used approximately million for system restoration costs related to the ice storm that affected our service territory in january  and approximately million for the wolf creek refueling outage 
we also used cash for increases in fuel and purchased power costs 
during  we received approximately million more in tax refunds than we did during cash paid for interest was million lower in than in due primarily to our lower debt balances 
cash flows from operating activities increased million to million in from million for this increase was primarily attributable to reduced interest of million and reduced tax payments of million 
cash flows used in from investing activities in general  cash used for investing purposes relates to the growth and improvement of our electric utility business 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in plant on an annual basis 
we spent million in  million in and million in on net additions to utility property  plant and equipment

future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect we will need cash mostly for utility construction programs designed to improve facilities providing electric service  for future peaking capacity needs and to comply with environmental regulations 
we anticipate that additional cash expenditures will be necessary to purchase and build additional peaking generation capacity that we anticipate will be needed in we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash flow  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility and through the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
if we are required to update emissions controls or take other remedial action as a result of the epa s investigation  the costs could be material 
we may also have to pay fines or penalties or make significant capital or operational expenditures related to the notice of violation we received from the epa in connection with certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center 
in addition  significant capital or operational expenditures may be required in order to comply with future environmental regulations or in connection with future remedial obligations 
the following table does not include any amounts related to these possible expenditures 
we expect that costs related to updating or installing emissions controls will be material 
as discussed above  the ecrr will allow for timely inclusion in rates of the costs of capital expenditures directly tied to environmental improvements required by the clean air act 
we believe that other costs incurred would qualify for recovery through rates

costs to retire wolf creek are currently being recovered through rates as provided by the kcc 
during we determined that we have conditional asset retirement obligations that are within the scope of fin the conditional asset retirement obligations include disposal of asbestos insulating material at our power plants  remediation of ash disposal ponds and the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb contaminated oil 
as of december   we recorded an asset retirement obligation of approximately million pursuant to the requirements of fin based on the fair value of these disposal obligations 
the amount of the retirement obligation related to asbestos disposal was recorded as of  the date when the environmental protection agency published the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants asbestos neshap revision  final rule 
we also capitalized the retirement obligation as an increase to the asset s carrying value 
the amount of the asset retirement obligation related to asbestos disposal was million at december  we operate  as permitted by the state of kansas  ash landfills at several of our power plants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging activity we may use derivative financial and physical instruments to economically hedge the price of a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine what the value will be when the agreements are actually settled 
in an effort to mitigate market risk associated with fuel and energy prices  we may use economic hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to price changes 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  financial instruments  energy marketing and risk management derivative instruments and hedge accounting hedging activities  for detailed information regarding hedging relationships and an interest rate swap we entered into during the third quarter of 
table of contents market price risks our economic hedging and trading activities involve risks  including commodity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk is the risk that changes in commodity prices may impact the price at which we are able to buy and sell electricity and purchase fuels for our generating units 
we believe we will continue to experience volatility in the prices for these commodities 
interest rate risk represents the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in the future  we may use swaps or other financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
credit risk represents the risk of loss resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
we have exposure to credit risk and counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as letters of credit  parental guarantees and master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
results actually achieved from economic hedging and trading activities could vary materially from intended results and could materially affect our consolidated financial results depending on the success of our credit risk management efforts 
commodity price exposure we may engage in both financial and physical trading to manage our commodity price risk 
we trade electricity  coal  natural gas and oil 
we use a variety of financial instruments  including forward contracts  options and swaps  and we trade energy commodity contracts 
we may also use economic hedging techniques to manage overall fuel expenditures 
we procure physical products under forward agreements and spot market transactions 
we are involved in trading activities to reduce risk from market fluctuations  enhance system reliability and increase profits 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to the risk that changing market prices could have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our risk of loss  in the form of increased costs  from market price changes in fuel is mitigated through the reca  which provides for inclusion of most fuel costs in retail rates 
we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
the var model is designed to measure the predicted maximum one day loss at a confidence level 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the use of the var method requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we are also exposed to the risk that we value and mark illiquid prices incorrectly 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period 
the calculation includes derivative commodity instruments used for both trading and risk management purposes 
the var amounts for and were as follows 
in thousands high low average we have considered a number of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our energy portfolio 
these risks include credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties  product location basis differentials and other risks 
declines in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could have a material adverse impact on our overall exposure to credit risk 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe are effective in managing overall credit risk 
there can be no assurance that the employment of var  or other risk management tools we employ  will eliminate the possibility of a loss 

table of contents we are also exposed to commodity price changes outside of trading activities 
we use derivative contracts for non trading purposes and a mix of various fuel types primarily to reduce exposure relative to the volatility of market and commodity prices 
the wholesale power market is extremely volatile in price and supply 
this volatility impacts our costs of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would purchase power in the wholesale market to the extent it is available  subject to possible transmission constraints  and or implement curtailment or interruption procedures as permitted in our tariffs and terms and conditions of service 
the loss of revenues associated with this could be material and adverse to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at our facilities that use fossil fuels and the nuclear refueling schedule 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
interest rate exposure we have entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt is computed by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 
we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt at december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact operating income on an annualized basis by approximately million 
security price risk we maintain trust funds  as required by the nrc and kansas state laws  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   these funds were comprised of domestic equity securities  debt securities and cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december  and million as of december  by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  we seek to maximize the returns to be utilized to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
we actively monitor the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trusts to various investment options 
our exposure to equity price market risk is  in large part  mitigated  due to the fact that we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in our electric rates  which would include unfavorable investment results
