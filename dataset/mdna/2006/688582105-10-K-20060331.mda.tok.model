item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we generate the majority of our revenues from fees charged for the processing and distribution of our proprietary allograft tissue products  grafton dbm and graftech bio implants  directly to hospitals and surgeons  domestically through our direct and agency sales force and internationally through stocking distributors 
through these two distribution methods  we also distribute traditional allograft bone tissue grafts  including soft tissue grafts 
we also generate revenues by processing donated allograft bone tissue for clients  primarily the musculoskeletal transplant foundation mtf  into traditional allograft bone tissue grafts or grafton dbm  which we return to our clients and they distribute to hospitals and surgeons 
additionally  we generate revenues by processing two private label dbm products for two different customers 
when we process allograft bone tissue for clients or process the two private label dbm products  we generate revenues by charging our customers a fee for our services 
for the initial processing of the allograft bone tissue  which includes the production of traditional and soft tissue grafts  we generally charge a flat service fee 
when we process grafton dbm for our clients or process a private label dbm for certain customers  we charge a service fee equal to a specified contractual percentage of the end user list price for each specific product code 
when we distribute allograft bone tissue grafts directly to surgeons and hospitals through our domestic direct and agency sales force  we charge a service fee to the hospital based upon our published end user list price  or in certain instances  based upon a negotiated discount to our end user list price 
internationally  we generally charge a contracted service fee for each allograft tissue graft provided to our stocking distributors 
as we have transitioned our general product distribution model from client processing to direct sales  we have been able to garner more of the actual end user sale price for each unit distributed by us 
the cost of each unit we distribute has also increased  since our unit cost now includes the costs associated with donor recovery and donor eligibility determinations  which previously was borne solely by our clients 
as such  our direct distribution efforts have a favorable impact on our revenues  but an unfavorable impact on our costs and gross profit margins  although theoretically we generate the same dollar margin on each unit sale 
however  as the allograft bone tissue market has become more competitive  price discounting has increased  which is also negatively impacting the margin we generate on each unit sale 
we have taken steps in to favorably influence our future gross profit margins by accelerating the development of new products  which will allow us to better utilize the allograft bone tissue we process  re aligning our work in process and finished goods tissue inventories to allow us to increase our inventory velocity  and reducing processing costs and increasing processing efficiencies 
we expect these efforts will continue through the first half of  while we anticipate we will not realize the full benefits from these efforts until the first half of in  we completed the sale of the building housing our principal processing operation to an unrelated party for million in cash 
we utilized the proceeds from this transaction to 
table of contents repay all of the then outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility of million and then terminated our line of credit and our credit facility 
the remaining proceeds from this transaction were utilized to pay expenses related to this transaction of 
million and provide additional cash reserves of million 
we utilized million of cash in to fund our capital expenditures  normal debt service and our net loss 
in  based upon our current operating plan  we anticipate utilizing a portion of our current cash reserves to fund capital expenditures  normal debt service  severance and retirement payments to former executives and employees and other components of working capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and may adjust them based upon the latest information available to us 
these estimates generally include those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories including purchase commitments  deferred processing costs including reserves for rework  excess and obsolescence  long lived assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in estimates of collection risk related to accounts receivable can result in decreases or increases in current period results of operations 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated returns based upon historical experience 
if future returns are less than our historical experience  reduction in estimated reserves would increase revenue 
alternatively  should returns exceed historical experience  additional allowances would be required  which would reduce revenue 
we write down inventory and deferred processing costs for estimated excess  obsolescence or unmarketable products and allograft bone tissue forms equal to the difference between cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
excess and obsolescence could occur from numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the competitive nature of the market  technological change  expiration and changes in surgeon preference 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required  including provisions to reduce inventory and deferred processing costs to net realizable value 
in each period  we also assess our production activity in relationship to historical experience and normal capacity and evaluate the need to reflect processing costs as either period costs or as a component of deferred processing costs 
in periods where our actual processing activities are less than 
table of contents historical experience normal capacity  we charge an appropriate portion of our processing costs directly to cost of services in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  we provide reserves  if any  for the difference between our contractual purchase commitments and our projected purchasing patterns based upon the maintenance of adequate inventory levels and forecasted revenues 
if actual revenue is less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional reserves may be required  alternatively  if revenue is stronger than forecasted by management  such reserves would be reduced 
we record an asset retirement obligation when a cost to retire an asset is incurred or when we determine a cost will be incurred in the future to retire an asset 
the asset retirement obligation is accrued at its estimated fair value with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  if appropriate 
we determine the amount of the asset retirement obligation based upon a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment and make adjustments to the asset retirement obligation recorded based on the passage or time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows related to the retirement of the asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we accrue current and future tax liabilities based upon levels of taxable income  tax planning strategies and assessments of the timing of taxability of tax attributes 
while we have considered current tax laws in establishing our tax liabilities  in the event we were to settle our tax liabilities for less than amounts accrued we would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine it would cost us more to settle our tax liabilities  an adjustment would be charged to income thus reducing income in that period 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and we are unable to predict the outcome of the pending litigation 
when we are reasonably able to determine the probable minimum or ultimate liability  if any  which may result from any of the pending litigation  we will record a provision for our best estimate of such liability  and if appropriate  will record a benefit for the amounts covered by insurance 
if the outcome or resolution of the pending litigation is for amounts greater than we have accrued  an adjustment will be charged to income in the period the determination is made 
alternatively  should the outcome or resolution be for less than we have accrued  we would increase income in the period the determination is made

in  the net loss of million  or 
diluted loss per share  resulted primarily from the impairment of certain assets related to our former processing environment located in shrewsbury  a severance charge for the reorganization of our sales and marketing organizations  
table of contents provisions for the exit from our metal spinal implant product lines and a disproportional effective tax rate 
net income in of million  or 
diluted earnings per share  which included a pre tax gain of million related to the settlement of certain patent litigation  resulted primarily from favorable gross profit margins 
net revenues net revenues increased in to million as compared to net revenues of million 
the increase in net revenues resulted principally from increased average unit selling prices related to the distribution of grafton dbm domestically because of an increase in unit sales volume sold directly by our agency sales force and a decline in unit sales volume by our clients  and increased unit volumes in the international distribution of grafton dbm 
net revenues declined in to million from net revenues of million in the decline in net revenues was primarily due to the loss of revenues associated with metal spinal implant product lines of million as a result of our exit from this portion of our business effective june  and the decline in domestic unit sales volumes in our two primary business segments  partially offset by increased unit volume from our international operations and the favorable impact of exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro of approximately million

in  domestic unit sales volume of grafton dbm was relatively flat with unit sales volumes in revenues from the shipment of private label dbm tissue forms declined in  primarily due to a reduction in orders from one of our partners as they adjusted their inventory levels 
international grafton dbm revenues increased in primarily due to increased 
table of contents unit sales volume over resulting from increased penetration in existing markets and the continued expansion into additional markets 
base tissue segment revenues in were relatively flat with base tissue segment revenues in service fees generated by processing allograft bone tissue for clients declined in as compared to  primarily due to processing fewer donors for clients in  partially offset by a increase in the average processing fee per donor in we expect processing fee revenues to continue to decline over the next several years as our processing agreements with our clients expire and are not replaced 
revenues generated from the distribution of graftech bio implants declined primarily due to continued lower demand and increased competition from polymer based spinal implants 
we anticipate revenues from our graftech bio implant product line will continue to decline over the next several years due to increased competition from non allograft bone spinal implants 
beginning in  we will begin distribution of our own polymer based spinal implant product line  graftcage spacer  which combined with our xpanse bone inserts provides an alternative for surgeons who prefer a polymer based implant 
revenues from the world wide distribution of traditional tissue increased in compared to  mainly from increased unit sales volume as we continue to expand our world wide presence in this market 
revenues from other product lines in mainly relate to the processing and distribution of bovine tissue graft in europe and the middle east 
in  revenues from other product lines included revenues from bovine tissue grafts and revenues from the distribution of metal spinal implants prior to our exit from that product line in june  compared to dbm segment revenues declined slightly in as compared to the decline in dbm segment revenues is primarily due to a decline in domestic grafton dbm revenues  partially offset by a increase in international grafton dbm revenues and a increase in private label dbm revenues 
domestic grafton dbm revenues declined primarily due to a decline in unit volume due to continued strong competition  partially offset by incremental revenues due to our capturing more of the end user sale price as a result of our direct distribution efforts 
international grafton dbm revenues increased in over primarily due to increased unit volume and the impact of favorable exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
private label dbm revenue increased primarily due to initial shipments in the second half of under our second private label arrangement 
in  base tissue segment revenues declined compared to the decline in base tissue segment revenues in is primarily attributable to an decline in base tissue processing fees resulting from processing fewer donors for our clients and a decline in domestic graftech bio implant revenues due to a decline in unit volume and increased pricing pressures 
these declines were partially offset by a increase in revenues from the world wide direct distribution of traditional allograft bone tissue forms 
revenues from other product lines declined in as compared to mainly related to our decision to cease marketing and distributing metal spinal implant products effective june  revenues generated from metal spinal implants were million and million in and  respectively

in january   mtf acquired the assets of the allograft tissue banking operation of arc 
gross margin year ended december  in thousands gross profit gross margin gross margin declined in as compared to primarily due to our strategic initiative to reduce work in process and finished goods tissue inventories and increase overall tissue inventory velocity  which resulted in our decision in may  to reduce unit production levels below unit sales levels for the balance of to allow us to consume existing tissue inventories and directly reduce overall tissue inventory levels 
as a result of this decision  our production activities fell below the range of normal capacity  as defined in sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 
 resulting in charges of million 
in addition  we also recognized charges of million related to reserves and write offs for excess  obsolete and expiring tissue inventories  primarily in the graftech bio implant product line  as a result of our standard inventory policies and procedures and to address our tissue inventory strategic initiatives 
the decline in gross margin also resulted from the continued shift in revenue mix  primarily related to the growth of international revenues  which represent of net revenues in as compared to in international revenues have a lower gross margin than domestic revenues due to utilization of a stocking distributor business model 
the decline in gross margin in compared to was primarily attributable to the charge associated with the impairment of certain assets that as of december  will no longer be utilized to process allograft bone tissue related to our former processing environment located at our facility in shrewsbury of million  the decline in unit production volume resulting from the decline in revenues  which has negatively impacted our ability to absorb fixed costs  and the charges  net of gains  associated with our exit from the metal spinal implant business

in addition  the dbm segment had lower gross margins due to the continued shift in revenue mix from higher gross margin products domestic client based grafton dbm to lower gross margin products international grafton dbm  private label dbms and the domestic direct distribution of grafton dbm 
the base tissue segment operating loss bears a substantial portion of the charges related to our strategic initiatives related to tissue inventories as the graftech bio implant product line and inventory was a primary focus of these initiatives 
we incurred a consolidated operating loss in compared to consolidated operating income in the decline in dbm segment operating income in is primarily due to a change in revenue mix from higher gross margin products to lower gross margin products  the general decline in unit volume  which resulted in the underabsorption of fixed overheads  increased operating expenses associated with the shift of sales and marketing resources from marketing metal spinal implant products to focus on our tissue businesses  and a portion of the severance costs related to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments 
dbm segment operating income in included income of million from the settlement of certain patent litigation 
we incurred an operating loss in the base tissue segment in compared to an operating income in the base tissue segment in the operating loss in is primarily attributable to the decline in revenues related to base tissue processing activities and domestic distribution of graftech bio implants  the decline in unit volume  increased operating expenses associated with programs to restore revenue growth  including the shift of sales and marketing resources from marketing metal spinal implant products to focus on our tissue businesses  a portion of the severance costs related to the reorganization of the sales and marketing departments  and the charge associated with the impairment of our former processing environment 
operating losses associated with other revenues is primarily associated with our metal spinal implant business  which we exited in june  and relates mainly to the provisions to reduce metal spinal implant inventory and instrumentation to net realizable value and legal fees associated with a lawsuit  partially offset by the reversal of a portion of the aforementioned reserve for metal spinal implant inventory due to the sale of the ovation inventory

income tax provision in  we provided a benefit for income taxes primarily for our ability to carryback our current year losses to prior tax years and obtain refunds and a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for all domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was established in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
the assessment under sfas 
table of contents no 
is required to be performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
aggregate cumulative losses generated by our domestic operation over the last several years and the potential for operating losses in the future represents sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require the establishment of a valuation allowance 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances 
we will continue to assess the need to maintain existing valuation allowances or to record additional valuation allowances based on facts and circumstances in each future period 
in  we provided a benefit for income taxes related mainly to losses in our domestic operations  mostly offset by a provision for income taxes for our french subsidiary and a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance for domestic state deferred tax assets 
our effective income tax rate in was 
the effective income tax rate exceeded the federal statutory income tax rate principally due to the impact of domestic state income taxes  partially offset by federal and state tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  working capital decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital in resulted primarily from the moderation of our work in process and finished goods tissue inventories as a result of the strategic actions we implemented in  partially offset by our continued investment in unprocessed donor tissue inventory in preparation for the anticipated termination of our processing agreements with mtf in on august   the company completed the sale of its principal processing facility located in eatontown  new jersey to an unrelated third party for million in cash 
the company also entered into an agreement to lease back the processing facility 
the lease agreement is for an initial term of years with two five year renewal options at the company s election 
the company retained ownership of all property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  directly related to the operation of the company s business 
the transaction has been recorded as a capital lease  with the resulting gain of approximately million from the sale of the facility deferred and amortized in proportion to the amortization of the leased assets

a portion of the proceeds from this transaction were utilized to repay the then outstanding balance of the mortgage and equipment term loan 
the line of credit had no amounts outstanding on august  as a result of these actions  the company cancelled the line of credit and terminated the credit facility 
at december   we had domestic federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in the state net operating loss carryforwards primarily offset new jersey taxable income  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through we have provided a full valuation allowances for all federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from these net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we have domestic federal research and development credits of  which expire in and state research and development  manufacturing and other credits of million  primarily to offset new jersey income taxes  which expire in varying amounts beginning in through at december   we had foreign net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million expiring in varying amounts beginning through we have not recognized any benefit from these net operating loss carryforwards in the consolidated financial statements because realization of the future tax benefits is uncertain

we believe that our currently available cash and 
table of contents cash equivalents and anticipated future cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our forecasted cash needs in our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our product development programs and the need and associated costs relating to regulatory approvals  if any  which may be needed to commercialize some of our products under development  and the resources we devote to the development  manufacture and marketing of our services and products 
we may seek additional funding to meet the needs of our long term strategic plans

this guidance must be implemented for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange fluctuations the results of operations for the periods discussed have not been materially affected by inflation 
we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations for material changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
as our foreign operations continue to grow and represent a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues and profits  foreign currency translation adjustments will impact our operating results to a greater extent 
the exchange rate as of december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an exchange rate of us dollars to one euro as of december  the average exchange rate for the year ended december  was us dollars to one euro compared to an average exchange rate for the year ended december  of us dollars to one euro 
a change in the average exchange rate  based on actual results for  would impact revenues by approximately million and net income loss by less than  in fourth quarter  as a result of a decision to utilize excess cash flow  if any  generated by our french subsidiary to repay the remaining outstanding balance of its intercompany debt  in accordance with sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we do not enter into derivative transactions related to our cash or cash equivalents 
accordingly  we are subject to changes in interest rates 
based on our december  cash and cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would impact net income loss by less than  the value of the us dollar affects our financial results 
changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and net income 
we do not maintain hedging programs to mitigate the potential exposures of exchange rate risk 
accordingly  our results of operations are adversely affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against currencies  primarily the euro  in which we sell products and services or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs 
based on the operating results of our foreign operations for the year ended december   a change in the exchange rates would impact our net income loss by less than  because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance
