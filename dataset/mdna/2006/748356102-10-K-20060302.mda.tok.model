questar e p s production increased to bcfe in  a increase compared to the year earlier period 
natural gas is questar e p s primary focus 
on an energy equivalent basis  natural gas comprised approximately of questar e p s production for a comparison of energy equivalent production by region is shown in the following table year ended december  in bcfe pinedale anticline uinta basin rockies legacy rocky mountain total midcontinent total questar e p production questar e p production from the pinedale anticline in western wyoming increased in and comprised of questar e p total production for the year 
questar e p completed new wells at pinedale during in the uinta basin of eastern utah  questar e p production increased to bcfe in compared to bcfe a year ago despite production constraints related to third quarter construction and maintenance on an interstate pipeline that serves the area 
production from questar e p s rockies legacy properties in was bcfe compared to bcfe during the period  a decrease 
legacy properties include all of questar e p s rocky mountain producing properties other than pinedale and the uinta basin 
production during the period was negatively impacted by normal field decline  seasonal restrictions that limit access to leases and wells during the winter months  payout of a high volume well that reduced the company s working interest and mechanical problems that delayed completion of a new well in the vermillion basin 
midcontinent production was bcfe in compared to bcfe for the same period of  a increase 
the company continued one rig development programs in both the hartshorne coalbed methane development project in the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma and the ongoing infill development drilling on the elm grove properties in northwest louisiana 
questar e p also benefited from higher realized prices for natural gas  oil and ngl 
in the weighted average realized natural gas price for questar e p including the effects of hedging was per mcf compared to per mcf in  a increase 
realized oil and ngl prices for averaged per bbl compared with per bbl during the prior year period  a increase

oil hedges reduced revenues million in and million in questar may hedge up to percent of its forecasted production from proved reserves to lock in acceptable returns on invested capital and to protect cash flow and earnings from a decline in commodity prices 
during  questar e p continued to take advantage of high natural gas and oil prices to add to hedge additional production in  and natural gas and oil hedges as of december   are summarized in item a of part i of this annual report 
questar e p s controllable production cost structure per unit of production the sum of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  lease operating expense  general and administrative expense and allocated interest expense increased to per mcfe in versus per mcfe in and per mcfe in questar e p s controllable production cost structure is summarized in the following table year ended december  per mcfe depreciation  depletion and amortization lease operating expense general and administrative expense allocated interest expense total controllable production costs depreciation  depletion and amortization expense rose in to per mcfe due to the ongoing depletion of older  lower cost reserves  reserve revisions for the company s uinta basin properties and higher reserve replacement finding and development costs 
higher day rates for rigs and other services in core operating areas  along with sharply higher steel prices  resulted in higher drilling and completion costs 
production taxes per mcfe produced were  and in  and  respectively 
increased production taxes were driven by higher gas  oil and ngl sales prices 
most production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of commodity sales prices 
higher lease operating expenses reflect a general increase in well service costs  including costs of contracted services and production related supplies  increased workover and production enhancement projects and additional production related costs 
exploration expense increased million in compared to the the expense increase was due to increased exploratory seismic acquisition expenditures in the midcontinent and uinta basin 
questar e p abandonment and impairment expense declined million in compared to the amount included million of expense due to a well with collapsed casing 
pinedale anticline drilling activity as of december   market resources operated and had an interest in producing wells on the pinedale anticline compared to and at year end and  respectively 
in august   the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission wogcc approved acre density drilling for lance pool combined lance and mesaverde formations wells on about  acres of market resources  acre gross pinedale leasehold 
the area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of market resources core acreage in the field 
on acre density  the company has over potential lance pool well locations at pinedale 
of the locations yet to be drilled  were booked as proved undeveloped at year end  leaving over locations unbooked 
questar e p has an average lance pool working interest of and an average net revenue interest of in of the locations 
wexpro has an average lance pool working interest of in of the locations  resulting in a combined average lance pool working interest for questar e p and wexpro of in the locations 
on august   questar e p reached a total depth of  feet in the hilliard shale at the stewart point exploratory well 
based on log information and gas shows  questar e p identified multiple zones of interest below the lance pool at depths from about  to  feet  ran casing to total depth and in mid september commenced hydraulic stimulation and testing 
starting in the lower part of the well  the company pumped three frac stages over a foot interval from  to  feet and began flowing the well back to sales on an inch choke 
during initial flowback  the company measured extrapolated flow rates as high as mmcf per day of dry  sweet gas with  to  psig flowing casing pressure and an extrapolated rate of about  barrels per day of frac water 
as the flowback continued  the well exhibited steadily declining rates and pressures and  on sev eral occasions  had to be shut in to remove debris plugging the choke 
eventually a combination of very small pieces of shale from the formation  proppant used in the fracs  and chunks of the flow through frac plugs used to isolate individual stages partially filled the wellbore  blocking the flow of gas to the surface 
the vertical extent of the obstruction is currently unknown 

given the very high formation pressures  specialized equipment a high pressure snubbing unit and experienced personnel are required to attempt to circulate out the obstruction inside the wellbore and either reestablish production from the initial test interval  or isolate that interval and move up hole to test additional zones 
the company was not able to secure the right snubbing unit and crew for this operation before cold winter weather would make this operation technically and operationally risky 
the resumption of testing of the well will be delayed until the spring of uinta basin during  the company drilled or participated in ten horizontal green river formation oil wells  wasatch and upper mesaverde gas wells  and five deeper blackhawk and mancos formation gas wells on its core acreage block 
in december  questar e p completed the wolf flat p well  the first well drilled under an exploration and development agreement eda with the ute indian tribe covering  acres of tribal minerals in the southern uinta basin 
questar e p has a working interest in the wolf flat well 
the company also completed acquisition of a d seismic survey covering a portion of the eda lands and exercised its option to acquire leases on all of the eda lands 
the ute indian tribe has the option to participate in the first well drilled in each section with up to a working interest 
on december   the company s second working interest test well in the flat rock prospect located one mile north of the wolf flat well  the fr p well  was waiting on completion 
rockies legacy in the vermillion basin on the southwestern wyoming northwestern colorado border  market resources continues to evaluate the potential of several formations at depths of  to  feet under the company s  net leasehold acres 
as of december   the company had recompleted two older wells  drilled and completed three new wells and was drilling one well  the canyon creek the first new well  alkali gulch unit well no  was completed in june and produced an average of mmcf per day from the baxter  frontier and dakota formations during the first days 
on december   the well was producing about mmcf per day 
the second new well  canyon creek  went to sales on september  during the first days of production  the well averaged about mmcf per day from the baxter and frontier formations 
the well was producing about mmcf per day on decem ber  after delays related to mechanical problems  the third new well  hiawatha deep unit no 
 was completed and turned to sales in mid november  during the first days of production  the well averaged mmcf per day from the baxter  frontier and dakota formations and was producing about 
mmcf per day on december  the company currently plans to drill about new wells in the vermillion basin during and has initiated the process with the bureau of land management blm for a new environmental impact statement covering the potential development of the deeper objectives 
midcontinent during  the company continued one rig development programs at both the hartshorne coalbed methane project in the arkoma basin of eastern oklahoma and the infill development drilling project in the elm grove properties in northwestern louisiana 
the company drilled or participated in new hartshorne wells in in the elm grove area  the company drilled or participated in new wells in and estimates that it has a remaining inventory of about locations 
wexpro wexpro s net income was million compared with million in and million in wexpro develops and produces gas reserves on behalf of affiliate questar gas 
pursuant to the wexpro agreement  wexpro recovers its costs and receives an unlevered after tax return of approximately on its investment in commercial wells and related facilities adjusted for working capital and reduced for deferred income taxes and depreciation investment base 
wexpro invested million  boosting its investment base to million at december   up million over the year earlier 
wexpro s net income also benefited from higher realized oil and ngl prices 
gas management gas management net income increased to million in from million in and million in gross keep whole processing margins revenue from the sale of extracted ngls less the cost of natural gas to replace the btu equivalent of extracted ngl volumes grew from million in to million in the first quarter acquisition of a gas plant in western wyoming drove a increase in extracted ngl volumes in versus the year earlier 
gathering volumes increased million mmbtu to million mmbtu in due primarily to expanding pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the uinta basin 
to reduce processing margin risk  gas management has restructured a number of its processing agreements with producers from keep whole contracts to fee based contracts 
a keep whole contract protects producers from frac spread risk  while fee based contracts eliminate commodity price risk for the plant owner 
to further reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts  gas management began managing ngl price risk in by using forward sales contracts 
in keep whole contracts benefited from a increase in ngl sales prices versus the prior year 
fee based contracts benefited from a increase in the rate charged per mmbtu processed in forward sales contracts decreased ngl revenues by million in earnings before tax from gas management s interest in rendezvous increased to million in versus million for  a increase 
earnings growth in rendezvous was driven by increased gathering volumes 
rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the pinedale and jonah producing areas 
gas management continues to invest in additional gas gathering and processing and liquids handling facilities to serve growing equity and third party production in its core areas of the pinedale and jonah fields in western wyoming and the uinta basin in eastern utah 
during the first quarter of  gas management acquired a cryogenic gas processing facility located approximately miles south of gas management s blacks fork plant  adding approximately mmcf per day of raw gas processing and ngl extraction capacity at its western wyoming hub 
the plant has been connected to the blacks fork granger complex to significantly enhance processing and blending capacity for pinedale  jonah and other western wyoming producers served by gas management and rendezvous 
gas management completed its condensate and produced water gathering and transportation facilities on market resources pinedale anticline leasehold in november in time to satisfy blm conditions for expanded winter access 
these new facilities will eliminate over  tanker truck trips per year at peak production from market resources operated acreage and the related air emissions  dust  noise  visual and traffic impacts 
gas management entered into an agreement with a third party producer to gather  compress and process gas in the uinta basin 
under terms of the fee based agreement  the company constructed gas compression facilities and expanded its existing red wash gas plant to process an additional mmcf per day of raw gas 
the processed gas and liquids are redelivered to the producer 
the new facilities were in service at the end of the third quarter gas management has also signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture with the ute indian tribe and another industry participant to build a gas gathering system for the flat rock area in southern uinta basin 
energy trading energy trading s net income for was million compared to million in and a loss of million in gross margins for gas and oil marketing gross revenues less costs for gas and oil purchases  transportation and gas storage increased to million in versus million a year ago  a increase 
the increase in gross margin was due primarily to a higher unit margin and a increase in volumes includes both equity and third party over the same period last year

questar pipeline added new transportation contracts in and for deliveries to the kern river pipeline at goshen  utah 
in the second quarter of  questar pipeline began service to an electric generation facility in central utah 
questar pipeline s existing transportation system is nearly fully contracted 
as of december   questar pipeline had firm transportation contracts of  mdth per day compared with  mdth per day as of december  the increase was primarily due to a new contract of mdth per day to serve an electric generation facility and mdth per day for an expansion of its southern system 
questar pipeline began partial service on this expansion in september and full service in november questar pipeline s firm transportation contracts had a weighted average remaining life of years as of december  questar gas is questar pipeline s largest transportation customer with firm transportation contracts for mdth per day  including mdth per day for winter peaking service 
most of these contracts extend through mid questar pipeline owns and operates the clay basin underground gas storage facility  the largest in the region  with working gas capacity of bcf 
this facility is subscribed under long term contracts 
in addition to clay basin  questar pipeline also owns and operates three smaller aquifer gas storage facilities 
questar pipeline s firm storage contracts had a weighted average remaining life of years as of december  questar gas has contracted for of firm storage capacity at clay basin for terms extending from three to years and of the firm storage capacity at the aquifer facilities for terms extending for years 
questar pipeline transportation and storage rates are based on straight fixed variable rate design and approved by the ferc 
all fixed costs of providing service including depreciation and return on investment are recovered through the demand charge 
fixed costs comprise about of questar pipeline costs and are recovered through demand charges 
therefore  questar pipeline s earnings are driven primarily by demand revenues from firm shippers 
variable operating costs based on throughput are recovered through volumetric charges 
with straight fixed variable rate design  period to period changes in firm transportation volumes do not have a significant impact on earnings

clay basin storage questar pipeline conducts periodic pressure tests on its clay basin storage facility 
beginning with a test in april  the company noted a discrepancy between the book volumes of cushion gas at clay basin and the volumes implied by pressure data 
questar pipeline retained a reservoir consultant to model the reservoir and determine the size and cause of the discrepancy 
the company conducted additional pressure tests in april  october  april and october to validate the model 
the reservoir model indicates from to bcf of gas may be missing from clay basin  with the most likely amount of bcf 
the gas loss is due to a combination of cumulative imprecision inherent in natural gas measurement devices and reservoir heterogeneity that impacts storage reservoir performance 
there is no indication that the reservoir is leaking 
the clay basin reservoir is functioning as expected to meet customer requirements 
questar pipeline has proposed to the ferc that the loss of gas be recorded as a reduction of native gas remaining in the reservoir which would not impact questar pipeline net income 
alternatively  if the ferc requires questar pipeline to adjust recoverable cushion gas  earnings could be reduced by about million after taxes 
carbon dioxide processing plant questar transportation services  a subsidiary of questar pipeline  owns non jurisdictional gathering lines and a processing plant near price  utah 
the plant was built in to process gas on behalf of questar gas

regulation ferc order no 
requires employees engaged in transportation system operations to function independently from employees of marketing and energy affiliates 
in addition a transportation provider must treat all transportation customers on a non discriminatory basis and must not operate its transportation system to preferentially benefit its marketing or energy affiliates 
questar pipeline has determined that all market resources subsidiaries except gas management are marketing or energy affiliates 
questar gas is not an energy or marketing affiliate 
questar pipeline is required to comply with the pipeline safety improvement act of this act and the rules issued by the dot require interstate pipelines and local distribution companies to implement a year program of risk analysis  pipeline assessment and remedial repair for transportation pipelines located in high consequence areas such as densely populated locations

the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs  are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
questar e p engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
if the undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the net book value of the asset group  the asset value is written down to estimated fair value  which is determined using discounted future net revenues 
accounting for derivatives the company uses derivative instruments  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas as amended 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production
