item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  certain statements in this annual report are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  which involve certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein  including but not limited to competition  customer and industry concentration  depending on technological developments  risks related to expansion  dependence on key personnel  fluctuating results and seasonality and control by management 
see the relevant portions of the company s documents filed with the securities and exchange commission and risk factors in item a  for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the company s business 
overview we are one of the largest providers of video and film asset management services to owners  producers and distributors of entertainment and advertising content 
we provide the services necessary to edit  master  reformat  archive and ultimately distribute our clients film and video content  including television programming  spot advertising  feature films and movie trailers using electronic and physical means 
we deliver commercials  movie trailers  electronic press kits  infomercials and syndicated programming to hundreds of broadcast outlets worldwide 
our interconnected facilities in los angeles  new york  chicago  dallas and san francisco provide service coverage in each of the major us media centers 
clients include major motion picture studios  advertising agencies and corporations 
we operate in a highly competitive environment in which customers desire a broad range of service at a reasonable price 
there are many competitors offering some or all of the services provided by the company 
additionally  some of our customers are large studios  which also have in house capabilities that may influence the amount of work outsourced to companies like point 
we attract and retain customers by maintaining a high service level at reasonable prices 
in recent years  electronic delivery services have grown while physical duplication and delivery have been declining 
we expect this trend to continue over a long term ie the next years 
all of our electronic  fiber optics  satellite and internet deliveries are made using third party vendors  which eliminates our need to invest in such capability 
however  the use of others to deliver our services poses the risk that costs may rise in certain situations that cannot be passed on to customers  thereby lowering gross margins 
there is also the risk that third party vendors who directly compete with us will succeed in taking away business or refuse to allow us to use their distribution channels 
in fact  in june  one such vendor competitor notified us that its electronic distribution channel would not be available to us except in very limited circumstances  or unless we entered certain preferred vendor arrangements that we believed would not be in the best long term interests of point 
while curtailment of these services has not materially affected our ability to deliver commercial spots  we have not been able to pass on increased alternative delivery costs to our customers since june while we are exploring other lower cost alternatives  gross margins related to spot delivery revenues will be lower until such alternatives become available 
the company has an opportunity to expand its business by establishing closer relationships with our customers through excellent service at a competitive price and maintaining adequate third party distribution channels 
our success is also dependent on attracting and maintaining employees capable of maintaining such relationships 
also  growth can be achieved by acquiring similar businesses for example  the acquisition of international video conversions  inc ivc in july which can increase revenues by adding new customers  or expanding services provided to existing customers 
our business generally involves the immediate servicing needs of our customers 
most orders are fulfilled within several days  with occasional larger orders spanning weeks or months 
at any particular time  we have little firm backlog 
we believe that our nationwide interconnected facilities provide the ability to better service national customers than single location competitors 
we will look to expand both our service offering and geographical presence through acquisition of other businesses or opening additional facilities 
during  we completed the acquisition of ivc and settled all disputes related to a proposed acquisition of three subsidiaries of alliance atlantis communications  inc alliance 
the financial statement comparisons below highlight the effects of these transactions 
the following table sets forth the amount and percentage relationship to revenues of certain items included within the company s consolidated statement of income for the years ended december   and the commentary below is based on these financial statements in thousands

contribution of ivc for the last six months of while the above presentation of pro forma income statements and adjustments do not represent the results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we believe that this disclosure provides useful information for readers of the financial statements in analyzing the causes of operating differences from period to period 
additional comparative data is set forth below 
in total  revenues in were greater than in without the inclusion of ivc results for the first six months of  revenues in would have been million  a decrease of from pro forma revenues if ivc had been purchased at the beginning of the year would have been million 
the addition of ivc not only increased revenues in twelve months of operations compared to six months in  but added to the cost infrastructure of the company in both cost of sales and selling  general and administrative s  g a areas 
with the inclusion of ivc  gross margins as a percentage of sales were about the same as those experienced in we expect similar gross margins in after including the increased lease costs approximately  resulting from the march sale leaseback of our media center facility 
we also expect sg a costs as a percentage of sales to be similar to those experienced in interest expense in is expected to be reduced by approximately  due to the march repayment of debt with proceeds from the sale leaseback 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in a million increase is due to the inclusion of ivc for the entire fiscal year as opposed to six months in ivc was acquired on july  
without ivc sales for the first six months of  twelve month sales declined million to million as compared to the decline is due to lower spot advertising revenues as customers switched to electronic from physical distribution 
revenues for physical distribution of tapes containing commercial spot advertising include tape stock and freight 
in electronic distribution  sales consist of only the electronic fee for distributing the advertisement 
gross profit 
in  gross profit decreased by of sales

the remainder of the increase in resulted in generally increasing interest rates on the company s variable rate debt and increased outstanding borrowings and a mortgage for all of due to the purchase of ivc in july and our media center land and building in august  respectively 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for and for the increase in effective tax rate is the result of the company s periodic assessment of the relationship of book tax timing differences to total expected annual pre tax results and the elimination of goodwill expense for financial statement purposes 
the effective tax rate percentage may change from period to period depending on the difference in the timing of the recognition of revenues and expenses for book and tax purposes 
the high effective rate for resulted from the relatively low amount of pre tax income when compared to such differences 
net income 
the net income for was million  a decrease of million compared to net income of million for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for were million  down from million in the decline in is due to lower spot advertising distribution for studio film releases and the early completion of a large firm re mastering project which contributed to higher sales

net income 
the net income for was million  a decrease of million compared to net income of million for liquidity and capital resources this discussion should be read in conjunction with the notes to the financial statements and the corresponding information more fully described elsewhere in this form k 
in may  the company and its banks entered into a term loan agreement with a maturity date of december  in january and february  the company made million of scheduled principal payments under the term loan 
in march  the company paid off the remaining million prior term loan principal balance with of cash and proceeds from the new million term loan pursuant to a new credit agreement 
the new agreement provided up to million of revolving credit availability for two years and a five year million five year term loan 
the agreement was subsequently amended to increase the revolving credit and term loan availability by million and million  respectively  concurrent with the acquisition of ivc 
in november  the company leased a new  square foot building in los angeles  california  for the purpose of consolidating four vault locations then occupying approximately  square feet 
a provision of the lease provided that in may  the company had an option to purchase the building for approximately  we purchased the building in august by paying  in cash and borrowing the  million balance under a mortgage term loan payable over years 
we also spent approximately million for improvements to the building during on december   the company entered a new million term loan agreement 
the term loan provides for interest at libor plus and is secured by the company s equipment 
the term loan will be repaid in equal principal payments plus interest 
proceeds of the loan were used to pay off our previously existing term loan 
in march  the company entered into a new revolving credit agreement which provides up to million of revolving credit 
the two year agreement provides for interest of libor plus for the first six months of the agreement  and thereafter either i prime minus 
or ii libor plus  depending on the level of the company s ratio of outstanding debt to fixed charges as defined 
the facility is secured by all of the company s assets  except for equipment securing a new term loan as described above 
in march  the company entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with respect to its real estate 
the real estate sold for  resulting in a million after tax gain 
additionally  we received  from the purchaser for improvements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales with leasebacks sfas  the gain will be amortized over the initial year lease term as reduced rent 
net proceeds at the closing of the sale and the improvement advance approximately million were used to pay off the mortgage and other outstanding debt 
in accordance with our agreement with the revolving credit lender  we prepaid million of the new term loan 
the following table summarizes the december  status of our revolving line of credit and term loans  and the pro forma balances showing the debt reduction from the proceeds of new loans and sale of real estate actual balance payments in march pro forma balance revolving credit current portion of mortgage and term loans long term portion of mortgage and term loans total monthly and annual principal and interest payments due under the new term debt are approximately  and million  respectively  assuming no change in interest rates  down from  and  respectively  from last year 
simultaneously  monthly and annual cash lease costs have increased by  and  respectively approximately  and  respectively  after considering the reduction in building depreciation expense and amortization of the deferred gain associated with the sale 
we expect that remaining amounts available under the new revolving credit arrangement  the availability of bank or institutional credit from new sources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund debt service  operating needs and about million of capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the acquisition of ivc was completed in july  for which we paid million in cash and borrowed the million 
the ivc purchase agreement also required payments of million  million and million in  and  respectively  if certain predetermined earnings levels as defined are met 
in april  million was paid 
million will be paid on march  the following table summarizes contractual obligations as of december  due in the future payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years and years and thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the following table summarizes contractual obligations as of december  due in the future after providing for the effects the sale and leaseback transaction in march payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years and years and thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total during the past year  the company has generated sufficient cash to meet operating  capital expenditure and debt service needs and obligations  as well as to provide sufficient cash reserves to address contingencies 
when preparing estimates of future cash flows  we consider historical performance  technological changes  market factors  industry trends and other criteria 
in our opinion  the company will continue to be able to fund its needs for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to consider the acquisition of businesses complementary to its current operations 
consummation of any such acquisition or other expansion of the business conducted by the company may be subject to the company securing additional financing  perhaps at a cost higher than our existing term loans 
future earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted to the extent that any acquired entities do not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to offset the increased financing costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgements 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we have made critical estimates in the following areas revenues 
we perform a multitude of services for our clients  including film to tape transfer  video and audio editing  standards conversions  adding effects  duplication  distribution  etc 
a customer orders one or more of these services with respect to an element commercial spot  movie  trailer  electronic press kit  etc the sum total of services performed on a particular element a package becomes the deliverable ie  the customer will pay for the services ordered in total when the entire job is completed 
occasionally  a major studio will request that package services be performed on multiple elements 
each element creates a separate revenue stream which is recognized only when all requested services have been performed on that element 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make judgments  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances as a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangibles  comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
long lived assets  including goodwill and intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset 
the cash flow projections are based on historical experience  management s view of growth rates within the industry and the anticipated future economic environment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following l significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  l significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  l significant negative industry or economic trends  l significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and l our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
any amount of impairment so determined would be written off as a charge to the income statement  together with an equal reduction of the related asset 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to approximately million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill beginning in in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the initial test on january   and the fiscal   and tests performed as of september    and  respectively  required no goodwill impairment 
an additional test was performed as of december  which required no impairment 
the discounted cash flow method used to evaluate goodwill impairment included cash flow estimates for and subsequent years 
if actual cash flow performance does not meet these expectations due to factors cited above  any resulting potential impairment could adversely affect reported goodwill asset values and earnings 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
the company did not record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of december recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no
