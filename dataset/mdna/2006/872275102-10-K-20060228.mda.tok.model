forward looking information management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of tcf financial corporation tcf or the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in item and selected financial data in item overview tcf is a delaware national financial holding company based in wayzata  minnesota 
its principal subsidiary  tcf bank  is headquartered in minnesota and had banking offices in minnesota  illinois  michigan  wisconsin  colorado and indiana at december  tcf provides convenient financial services through multiple channels to customers located primarily in the midwest 
tcf has developed products and services designed to meet the needs of all consumers 
the company focuses on attracting and retaining customers through service and convenience  including branches that are open seven days a week and on most holidays  extensive full service supermarket branches and automated teller machine atm networks  and telephone and internet banking 
tcf s philosophy is to generate net interest income and fees and other revenue growth through business lines that emphasize higher yielding assets and lower or no interest cost deposits 
the company s growth strategies include new branch expansion and the development of new products and services 
new products and services are designed to build on existing businesses and expand into complementary products and services through strategic initiatives 
tcf s core businesses include retail banking  commercial banking  small business banking  consumer lending  leasing and equipment finance  and investments  securities brokerage and insurance services 
the retail banking business includes traditional and supermarket branches  campus banking  express teller atms and visa usa inc visa cards 
tcf emphasizes the checking account as its anchor account  which provides opportunities to cross sell other convenience products and services and generate additional fee income 
the continued growth of checking accounts is a significant part of tcf s growth strategy 
total checking accounts were  at december   and increased  accounts from december  the number of atms that are free to tcf customers increased from  at december   to  at december  the increase was primarily the result of an atm branding agreement with eleven  inc  which added tcf branded atms during the third quarter of  that are owned and operated by eleven  inc opening new branches is an integral part of tcf s growth strategy for generating new deposit accounts and the related revenue that is associated with the accounts and other products 
new branches typically produce net losses during the first months of operations before they become profitable  and therefore the level and timing of new branch expansion can have a significant impact on tcf s profitability 
tcf s growth in checking accounts is primarily occurring in new branches with growth in older  mature branches being slower 
the success of tcf s branch expansion is dependent on the continued long term success and viability of branch banking 
tcf s lending strategy is to originate high credit quality  primarily secured  loans and leases 
commercial loans are generally made on local properties or to local customers 
tcf s largest core lending business is its consumer home equity loan operation  which offers fixed and variable rate loans and lines of credit secured by residential real estate properties 
the leasing and equipment finance businesses consist of tcf equipment finance  inc tcf equipment finance  a company that delivers equipment finance solutions to businesses in select markets  and winthrop resources corporation winthrop  a leasing company that primarily leases technology and data processing equipment 
tcf s leasing and equipment finance businesses operate in all states and source equipment installations domestically and  to a limited extent  in foreign countries 
as a primarily secured lender  tcf emphasizes credit quality over asset growth 
as a result  tcf s credit losses are generally lower than those experienced by other banks 
the allowance for loan and lease losses  while generally lower as a percent of loans and leases than the average in the banking industry  reflects the lower historical charge offs and management s expectation of the risk of loss inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
see consolidated financial condition analysis allowance for loan and lease losses 
net interest income  the difference between interest income earned on loans and leases and on investments  and interest expense paid on deposits and short term and long term borrowings  represented of tcf s total revenue in net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates  customer prepayment patterns  the mix of interest earning assets and the mix of interest bearing and non interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
tcf manages the risk of changes in interest rates on its net interest income through an asset liability committee and through related interest rate risk monitoring and management policies 
during  tcf s net interest margin declined from for to for this decline was primarily due to growth in deposits with higher interest rates and increased fixed rate loans with lower yields than variable rate loans as a result of the flattening yield curve and changing customer preferences 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion on tcf s interest rate risk position 
non interest income is a significant source of revenue for tcf and an important factor in tcf s results of operations 
a key driver of non interest income is checking accounts and their related activities 
increasing fee and service charge revenues has been challenging during as a result of slower growth in checking accounts and changing customer behaviors 
fee revenue per retail checking account was for  down from in tcf is focusing on checking account growth to increase future fee revenue 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated income statement analysis non interest income for additional information 
the company s visa debit card program has grown significantly since its inception in tcf is one of the largest issuers of visa classic debit cards in the united states 
tcf earns interchange revenue from customer debit card transactions 
the following portions of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations focus in more detail on the results of operations for  and and on information about tcf s balance sheet  credit quality  liquidity and funding resources  capital and other matters

banking non interest expense totaled million  up from million in the increases were primarily due to compensation and benefits and occupancy costs associated with new branch expansion  increases in card processing and issuance expenses related to the overall increase in card volumes  and increases in net real estate expense as a result of net recoveries on sales of foreclosed properties in  partially offset by a decrease in deposit account losses 
leasing and equipment finance  an operating segment comprised of tcf s wholly owned subsidiaries tcf equipment finance and winthrop  provides a broad range of comprehensive lease and equipment finance products

the decrease in the provision for credit losses from was primarily related to improved credit quality of the portfolio excluding leveraged leases 
non interest income totaled million in  down million from million in the decrease in leasing and equipment finance revenues for  compared with  was primarily due to lower sales type lease revenues  partially offset by higher operating lease revenues and other transaction fees 
leasing and equipment finance revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on customer driven factors not entirely within the control of tcf 
non interest expense totaled million in  up million from million in  primarily related to an increase in operating lease depreciation expense 
consolidated income statement analysis net interest income net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and leases  securities available for sale  investments and other interest earning assets interest income  and interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest expense  represented of tcf s revenue in net interest income divided by average interest earning assets is referred to as the net interest margin  expressed as a percentage 
net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in interest rates  loan and deposit pricing strategies and competitive conditions  the volume and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets

changes due to volume and rate are calculated independently for each line item presented 
achieving net interest income growth over time is dependent on tcf s ability to generate higher yielding assets and lower cost retail deposits 
while interest rates and consumer preferences continue to change over time  tcf is relatively balanced from an interest rate gap measure difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing  repricing  or prepaying during the next twelve months 
if interest rates remain at current levels or decrease  tcf could experience continued compression of its net interest margin primarily due to the ongoing shift of higher yielding variable rate loans to lower yielding fixed rate loans and lower cost deposits to higher cost deposits 
if interest rates increase  tcf s net interest income is likely to increase  but could be partially offset by an adverse impact on deposit account balances and rates  as competition for checking  savings and money market deposits  important sources of lower cost funds for tcf  is intense 
see consolidated financial condition analysis deposits and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion on tcf s interest rate risk position 
net interest income was million for  up from million in the increase in in net interest income primarily reflects the growth in average consumer  commercial and leasing and equipment finance balances  up billion over  partially offset by higher funding costs 
the decrease in the net interest margin  from in to in  is primarily due to the rates on interest bearing liabilities increasing more than the yields on interest earning assets  as a result of increased deposits with higher rates and increased fixed rate consumer loans with yields lower than variable rate loans 
tcf s benefit from the rising short term interest rates  and the related increase in yields on variable rate loans  has been more than offset by the impact of a flattening yield curve making fixed rate loans more attractive to customers and changes in the funding mix as the majority of deposit growth has been in higher interest cost products 
net interest income was million in  up from million in the increase in from in net interest income primarily reflects the growth in average consumer  commercial and leasing and equipment finance balances  up billion over  partially offset by the reductions in residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities  down million from  and residential mortgage loans held for sale  down million during the same period 
the decrease in average residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities reflected management s decision to delay investing in long term fixed rate residential real estate loans and mortgage backed securities to replace prepayments and sales of such assets during the very low interest rate environment coupled with the growth in higher yielding consumer  commercial and lease equipment finance loans and leases 
provision for credit losses tcf provided million for credit losses in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in the provision from was primarily due to improved credit quality  including a million commercial business loan recovery in net loan and lease charge offs were million  or

net loan and lease charge offs excluding the charge off related to the leveraged lease were million  or 
of average loans and leases in the provision for credit losses is calculated as part of the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the related provision for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate which involves a number of factors such as historical trends in net charge offs  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio  value of collateral  general economic conditions and management s assessment of credit risk in the current loan and lease portfolio

non interest income non interest income is a significant source of revenue for tcf  representing of total revenues in  and is an important factor in tcf s results of operations 
providing a wide range of retail banking services is an integral component of tcf s business philosophy and a major strategy for generating additional non interest income

fees and service charges fees and service charges decreased million  or  to million for  compared with million for this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in deposit account service fees  attributable to changing customer behavior and payment trends 
card revenue during  card revenue  primarily interchange fees  totaled million  up  from million in the increase in card revenue in was primarily attributed to increased customer transaction volumes and related fees 
the continued success of tcf s debit card program is dependent on the success and viability of visa and the continued use by customers and acceptance by merchants of its debit and credit cards 
see item a 
risk factors operational risk management for further discussion of visa litigation 
atm revenue atm revenue totaled million for  down from million in the decline in atm revenue was attributable to the continued decline in utilization of tcf s atm machines by non customers  tcf customers use of non tcf atm machines and lower atm revenues from tcf customers due to deliberate tcf checking product modifications  partially offset by the increased number of tcf customers with cards 
these declines resulted from increased use of debit cards as well as the increased competition from other atm networks 
additionally  as atm site contracts have been renewed  merchants have generally required a larger percentage of the fee charged to non customers for the use of tcf s atm s

sales of insurance and investment products may fluctuate from period to period  and future sales levels will depend upon general economic conditions and investor preferences 
sales of annuities will also depend upon their continued tax advantage and may be negatively impacted by the level of interest rates and alternative investment products 
leasing and equipment finance revenue leasing and equipment finance revenues decreased million  or  in  following a decrease of thousand  or  in the decrease in leasing revenues for was primarily driven by a decline in sales type lease revenues of million  partially offset by a million increase in operating lease revenues 
sales type revenues generally occur at or near the end of the lease term as customers extend the lease or purchase the underlying equipment 
the increase in operating lease revenues was primarily driven by a million increase in average operating lease balances 
leasing and equipment finance revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on customer driven factors not entirely within the control of tcf 
mortgage banking revenue mortgage banking revenue decreased million to million in  compared with million for the decrease in mortgage banking revenue for  compared with was primarily due to a million decrease in gains on sales of loans and million of mortgage servicing rights recovery recorded in  compared with million of impairment recorded in the following table sets forth information about mortgage banking revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands servicing income less mortgage servicing amortization recovery impairment net servicing income loss gains on sales of loans other income total mortgage banking revenue beginning in  tcf s mortgage banking business no longer originates or sells loans

the valuation of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting estimate for tcf 
this estimate is based upon loan types  note rates and prepayment assumptions 
changes in the mix of loans  interest rates  defaults or prepayment speeds may have a material effect on the amortization amount and possible impairment in valuation 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayment speed assumptions will increase and result in an acceleration in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights as the underlying loan portfolio declines and also may result in impairment as the value of the mortgage servicing rights decline 
tcf periodically evaluates its capitalized mortgage servicing rights for impairment 
a key component in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is the projected cash flows of the underlying loan portfolio 
tcf uses projected cash flows and related prepayment assumptions based on management s best estimates 
the prepayment rate on the third party servicing portfolio was in  compared with in in january  tcf entered into an agreement to sell its third party mortgage servicing rights for an amount in excess of carrying value 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning tcf s mortgage servicing rights 
the following tables summarize the servicing portfolio by interest rate tranche  the prepayment speed assumptions and the weighted average remaining life of the loans by interest rate tranche used in the determination of the value and amortization of mortgage servicing rights as of december  and at december  dollars in thousands prepayment weighted prepayment weighted unpaid speed average life unpaid speed average life interest rate tranche balance assumption in years balance assumption in years to to to and higher at december  and  the sensitivities of the current fair value of mortgage servicing rights to a hypothetical immediate and adverse change in prepayment speed assumptions and discount rate are as follows at december  dollars in millions fair value of mortgage servicing rights weighted average life in years weighted average prepayment speed assumption weighted average discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change in prepayment speed assumptions impact on fair value of adverse change in prepayment speed assumptions impact on fair value of adverse change in discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change in discount rate these sensitivities are theoretical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a given variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the above table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is calculated independently without changing any other assumptions 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  changes in prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in discount rates or market interest rates  which might either magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
tcf does not use derivatives to hedge its mortgage servicing rights asset

income taxes income tax expense represented of income before income tax expense during  compared with and in and  respectively 
the lower effective income tax rate in was primarily due to the closing of certain previous years tax returns  clarification of existing state tax legislation and developments in income tax audits 
the lower effective tax rate in compared with primarily reflects increases in investments in tax advantaged affordable housing limited partnerships and lower state income taxes 
tcf has a real estate investment trust reit and a related foreign operating company foc that acquire  hold and manage real estate loans and other assets 
these companies are consolidated with tcf bank and are therefore included in the consolidated financial statements of tcf financial corporation 
the reit and related companies must meet specific provisions of the internal revenue code and state tax laws 
if these companies fail to meet any of the required provisions of federal and state tax laws  tcf s tax expense could increase 
tcf s foc operates under laws in certain states including minnesota and illinois that allow deductions for income derived from focs 
use of these companies is and has been the subject of federal and state audits 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is a critical accounting estimate which is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  the differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts due or owed such as the timing of reversal of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards 
additionally  there can be no assurances that estimates and interpretations used in determining income tax liabilities may not be challenged by federal and state taxing authorities 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and income tax law interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities 
in addition  under generally accepted accounting principles  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the current prevailing federal and state income tax rates 
if such rates change  deferred income tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted in the period of change through a charge or credit to income tax expense 
further detail on income taxes is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

management expects that the residential loan portfolio will continue to decline  which will provide funding for anticipated growth in other loan or investment categories 
at december   tcf s residential real estate loan portfolio was comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans

this table does not include the effect of prepayments  which is an important consideration in management s interest rate risk analysis 
company experience indicates that the loans remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms 
allowance for loan and lease losses the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses is a critical accounting estimate which involves management s judgment on a number of factors such as historical trends in net charge offs  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio  values of underlying loan and lease collateral  impaired loan analysis  general economic conditions and management s assessment of credit risk in the current loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased by the provision for credit losses charged to expense and reduced by loan and lease charge offs  net of recoveries 
the company considers the allowance for loan and lease losses of million appropriate to cover losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolios as of december  however  no assurance can be given that tcf will not  in any particular period  sustain loan and lease losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and tcf s ongoing credit review process  will not require significant changes increases or decreases in the allowance for loan and lease losses and the associated provisions for credit losses 
among other factors  a protracted economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial or residential real estate values in tcf s markets may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss

the next several pages include detailed information regarding tcf s allowance for loan and lease losses  net charge offs  non performing assets  past due loans and leases and potential problem loans and leases 
included in this data are numerous portfolio ratios that must be carefully reviewed and related to the nature of the underlying loan and lease portfolios before appropriate conclusions can be reached regarding tcf or for purposes of making comparisons to other companies 
most of tcf s non performing assets and past due loans and leases are secured by residential real estate 
given the nature of these assets and the related mortgage foreclosure  property sale and  if applicable  mortgage insurance claims processes  it can take months or longer for a loan to migrate from initial delinquency to final disposition 
this resolution process generally takes much longer for loans secured by real estate than for unsecured loans or loans secured by other property primarily due to state foreclosure laws 
the key indicators of tcf s credit quality and reserve coverage for include the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases of  the year end allowance as a multiple of net charge offs of x  and income before income taxes and provision for loan losses as a multiple of net charge offs of x

the various factors used in the methodologies are reviewed on a periodic basis 
the total allowance for loan and lease losses is generally available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of tcf s allowance for loan and lease losses is disclosed in the following table and is subject to change based on the changes in criteria used to evaluate the allowance and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future losses in any particular portfolio 
in  tcf refined its allowance for loan and lease losses allocation methodology resulting in an allocation of the entire allowance for loan and lease losses to the individual loan and lease portfolios 
this change resulted in the allocation of the previous unallocated portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses

the allocated allowance balances for tcf s residential and consumer loan portfolios  at december  reflect the company s credit quality and related low level of historical net charge offs for these portfolios 
the decrease in the allocated allowance for leasing and equipment finance in is primarily related to the charge off of the investment in the leveraged lease 
tcf has no other leveraged leases or exposure to the airline industry

the decrease in total non performing assets from to was primarily due to the million charge off of the investment in the leveraged lease and the sale of several foreclosed commercial real estate properties 
approximately of non performing assets at december  consisted of  or were secured by  residential real estate 
the accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when loans and leases become days or more past due with respect to either principal or interest days or six payments past due for loans secured by residential real estate unless such loans and leases are well secured and in the process of collection

there were no impaired loans at december  and which did not have a related allowance for loan losses 
the average balance of impaired loans was million for  compared with million for the increase in non accrual consumer loans is primarily due to increased bankruptcies resulting from a change in bankruptcy laws in october  past due loans and leases the following table sets forth information regarding tcf s delinquent loan and lease portfolio  excluding loans held for sale and non accrual loans and leases

although these loans and leases have been identified as potential problem loans and leases  they may never become non performing 
additionally  these loans and leases are generally secured by commercial real estate or other assets  thus reducing the potential for loss should they become non performing 
potential problem loans and leases are considered in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
leasing and equipment finance had no potential problem loans funded on a non recourse basis at december   compared with million at december  potential problem loans and leases are summarized as follows at december  change dollars in thousands commercial real estate commercial business leasing and equipment finance total liquidity management tcf manages its liquidity position to ensure that the funding needs of depositors and borrowers are met promptly and in a cost effective manner 
asset liquidity arises from the ability to convert assets to cash as well as from the maturity of assets 
liability liquidity results from the ability of tcf to attract a diversity of funding sources to promptly meet funding requirements 
deposits are the primary source of tcf s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes 
in addition to deposits  tcf derives funds primarily from loan and lease repayments  proceeds from the discounting of leases and borrowings 
deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates  money market conditions  competition for funds  customer service and other factors 
tcf s deposit inflows and outflows have been and will continue to be affected by these factors 
borrowings may be used to compensate for reductions in normal sources of funds  such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels  net deposit outflows or to support expanded activities 
historically  tcf has borrowed primarily from the fhlb  from institutional sources under repurchase agreements and  to a lesser extent  from other sources 
at december   tcf had over billion in unused capacity under these funding sources  which could be used to meet future liquidity needs 
see borrowings 
potential sources of liquidity for tcf financial corporation parent company only include cash dividends from tcf s wholly owned bank subsidiary  issuance of equity securities and borrowings under a million line of credit 
tcf bank s ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to tcf is restricted by regulation and may require regulatory approval 
deposits checking  savings and money market deposits are an important source of low cost funds and fee income for tcf 
deposits totaled billion at december   up billion from december  checking  savings and money market deposits totaled billion  up million from december   and comprised of total deposits at december   compared with of total deposits at december  the average balance of these deposits for was billion  an increase of million over the billion average balance for at december   certificates of deposit increased million from december  tcf had no brokered deposits at december  or tcf s weighted average rate for deposits  including non interest bearing deposits  was at december   up from 
at december   primarily reflecting increases in premier checking and premier savings average balances and overall increases in interest rates 
new branch expansion key to tcf s growth is its continued investment in new branch expansion 
new branches are an important source of new customers in both deposit products and consumer lending products 
while supermarket branches continue to play an important role in tcf s expansion strategy  the opportunity to add new supermarket branches within tcf s markets has slowed 
therefore  tcf will continue new branch expansion by opening more traditional branches 
although traditional branches require a higher initial investment than supermarket branches  they ultimately attract more customers and become larger and more profitable 
during  tcf opened new branches 
the focus on opening new branches will continue in with the planned opening of branches  including new traditional branches  five new supermarket branches and two new campus branches 
during the fourth quarter of  tcf announced plans to enter the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area market 
initially  tcf plans to open several consumer loan production offices during with construction of retail branches to begin later in or early at december    or  of tcf s branches were opened since january  additional information regarding tcf s branches opened since january  is displayed in the table below percentage at or for the year ended december  increase dollars in thousands number of new branches opened during the year traditional nm supermarket nm campus nm total nm number of new branches at year end traditional nm supermarket nm campus nm total nm percent of total branches nm number of checking accounts deposits checking savings money market subtotal certificates of deposit nm total deposits total fees and other revenue for the year nm not meaningful 
borrowings borrowings totaled billion at december   down million from december  the decrease was primarily due to the overall increase in deposits exceeding the growth in assets 
during  tcf bank issued million of subordinated notes due in the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of for the first five years and will reprice quarterly thereafter at the three month libor rate plus 
these notes qualify as tier or supplemental capital for regulatory purposes  subject to certain limitations 
tcf bank paid the proceeds from the offering to tcf as a permanent capital distribution 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on tcf s borrowings 
the weighted average rate on borrowings increased to at december   from at december  primarily due to the impact of rising short term interest rates 
tcf does not utilize unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities to provide off balance sheet borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information relating to off balance sheet instruments 
tcf financial parent company only has a million line of credit maturing in april  which is unsecured and contains certain covenants common to such agreements

the interest rate on the line of credit is based on either the prime rate or libor 
tcf has the option to select the interest rate index and term for advances on the line of credit 
the line of credit may be used for appropriate corporate purposes

contractual obligations and commitments as disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  tcf has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations excluding bank deposits and commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years total borrowings annual rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases campus marketing agreements construction contracts and land purchase commitments for future branch sites in thousands amount of commitment expiration by period less than after commitments total year years years years commitments to lend consumer home equity and other commercial leasing and equipment finance other total commitments to lend loans serviced with recourse standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds commitments to lend are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since certain of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
collateral predominantly consists of residential and commercial real estate 
campus marketing agreements consist of fixed or minimum obligations for exclusive marketing and naming rights with campuses 
tcf is obligated to make various annual payments for these rights in the form of royalties and scholarships through tcf also has various renewal options which may extend the terms of these agreements 
on april   tcf s board of directors and the university of minnesota board of regents ratified contracts for tcf s sponsorship of a new on campus football stadium to be called tcf bank stadium and an extension of tcf s sponsorship of the u card 
the u card serves as a key for access to a variety of university services 
tcf also sponsors similar cards for other campuses 
these obligations are included in the table above 
the naming rights agreement with the university of minnesota is dependent upon several contingencies  including receipt of necessary state and private funding and completion of stadium construction 
on december   tcf and the university of minnesota announced an extension of the funding contingency period under the stadium naming rights agreement to june  the extension was necessary because the minnesota legislature has not taken action on a bill to finance the state s portion of the stadium s cost 
campus marketing agreements are an important element of tcf s campus banking strategy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tcf s results of operations are dependent to a large degree on its net interest income and its ability to manage interest rate risk 
although tcf manages other risks  such as credit risk  liquidity risk  operational and other risks  the company considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
see item a 
risk factors operational risk management for further discussion 
since tcf does not hold a trading portfolio  the company is not exposed to market risk from trading activities 
the mismatch between maturities  interest rate sensitivities and prepayment characteristics of assets and liabilities results in interest rate risk 
tcf  like most financial institutions  has material interest rate risk exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates as well as variable interest rate indices eg  the prime rate 
tcf s asset liability committee manages tcf s interest rate risk based on interest rate expectations and other factors 
the principal objective of tcf s asset liability management activities is to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity risk and facilitating the funding needs of the company 
tcf utilizes net interest income simulation models to estimate the near term effects next twelve months of changing interest rates on its net interest income  relative to a base case scenario 
net interest income simulation involves forecasting under a variety of scenarios  including the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
at december   net interest income is estimated to increase by  compared with the base case scenario  over the next twelve months if short and long term interest rates were to sustain an immediate increase of basis points 
in the event short and long term interest rates were to decline by basis points  net interest income is estimated to decrease by  compared with the base case scenario  over the next twelve months 
management exercises its best judgment in making assumptions regarding loan prepayments  deposit withdrawals  calls on wholesale borrowings and other non controllable events in estimating tcf s exposure to changes in interest rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the simulation models cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
in addition to the net interest income simulation model  management utilizes an interest rate gap measure difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities repricing within a given period 
while the interest rate gap measurement has some limitations  including no assumptions regarding future asset or liability production and a static interest rate assumption large changes may occur related to these items  the interest rate gap represents the net asset or liability sensitivity at a point in time 
an interest rate gap measure could be significantly affected by external factors such as loan prepayments  early withdrawals of deposits  changes in the correlation of various interest bearing instruments  competition  or a rise or decline in interest rates 
tcf s one year interest rate gap was a positive million  or of total assets at december   compared with a positive million  or of total assets at december  a positive interest rate gap position exists when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing  including assumed prepayments  within a particular time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing 
the decrease in the gap position compared with december  was primarily due to a decrease in variable rate loans  a decrease in assumed prepayments on fixed and adjustable rate loans and investments  and an increase in rate sensitive deposits  partially offset by the extensions of long term borrowings 
since december   short term interest rates have increased approximately basis points  while the year treasury rate has increased only about basis points 
this flattening of the yield curve has resulted in a change in tcf loan customer preference toward fixed rate loans versus variable rate loans  including both new loan originations and refinancing of existing variable rate loans to fixed rate loans 
as a result  fixed rate loans have increased and variable rate loans have decreased 
in response to this changing mix of assets  management extended million of borrowings in the first quarter of  million in the third quarter and billion in the fourth quarter 
if interest rates remain at current levels  tcf could experience continued compression of its net interest margin due primarily to the ongoing shift of higher yielding variable rate loans to lower yielding fixed rate loans and lower cost deposits to higher cost deposits 
if interest rates fall  tcf could experience an increase in prepayments of fixed rate mortgage backed securities  residential real estate loans  consumer loans and commercial real estate loans  causing further compression of its net interest margin 
an increase in long term interest rates would likely have a favorable impact on tcf s net interest income  but may be partially diminished by an adverse impact on tcf s deposit account balances  if customers transfer some of their funds to higher interest rate deposit products or other investments  resulting in an increase in the total cost of funds for tcf 
tcf estimates that an immediate basis point decrease in current mortgage loan interest rates would increase prepayments on the billion of fixed rate mortgage backed securities  residential real estate loans and consumer loans at december   by approximately million  or  in the first year 
an increase in prepayments would decrease the estimated life of the portfolios and may adversely impact net interest income or net interest margin in the future 
although prepayments on fixed rate portfolios are currently at a relatively low level  tcf estimates that an immediate basis point increase in current mortgage loan interest rates would reduce prepayments on the fixed rate mortgage backed securities  residential real estate loans and consumer loans at december   by approximately million  or  in the first year

at december   the contract rates on all callable borrowings exceeded current market rates
