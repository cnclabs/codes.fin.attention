item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read this discussion together with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from those presently anticipated due to a variety of factors  including those discussed in item a of this report 
in this report we refer to the years ended or ending march     and as fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal general we develop and sell devices using spintronics  a technology we helped pioneer  which utilizes electron spin rather than electron charge to acquire  store  and transmit information 
our products include magnetic sensors to acquire ultra precise data such as the position of a robot arm  and couplers to transmit data between electronic systems at very high speed 
we are also a licensor of spintronic magnetoresistive random access memory technology  commonly referred to as mram  which we believe has the potential to revolutionize electronic memory 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below 
product warranty estimation we maintain a reserve for warranty claims based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  releases of new products and other factors 
the warranty period for our products is generally one year 
although we believe the likelihood to be relatively low  claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new products  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
as of march  and our estimated reserve for warranty claims were not material to our financial statements 
inventory reserves estimation we maintain reserves for potentially excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon expected product lives  competitive conditions  industry conditions  and forecasted sales demand 
our results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of an industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements by us or in the industry 
alternatively  if we are able to sell previously reserved inventory  we reverse a portion of the reserve 
changes in inventory reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
as of march  our obsolescence reserve was  compared to  at march  the decrease was due to the disposal of parts that were previously included in our reserve 
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
the most significant risk is the risk of sudden unexpected deterioration in financial condition of a significant customer that is not considered in the allowance 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  and customer credit worthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our results could be materially impacted if the financial condition of a significant customer deteriorated and related accounts receivable are deemed uncollectible 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  at both march  and we expect our allowance for doubtful accounts to remain a relatively small percentage of our accounts receivable because much of our receivables are with us government agencies  large customers  and distributors  which we consider generally credit worthy 
our allowance for doubtful accounts could increase in the future if larger portions of our sales come from small end user customers 
deferred tax assets estimation in determining the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions to realize the benefit of these assets 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances or reduction of existing allowances quarterly 
in fiscal and fiscal we reduced the amounts of our valuation allowances based upon our history and our expectations for taxable income 
we began recognizing tax expenses for reporting purposes in fiscal because we had exhausted our net operating losses net of stock based compensation 
we do not expect to pay taxes in the near future  however  because we have the carryforward of prior years stock based compensation deductions available to offset future taxes 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation deductions for tax return purposes do not reduce taxes reported for book purposes but are credited to additional paid in capital 
as of march   our deferred tax assets were  with a related valuation allowance of  compared to  with a valuation allowance of  as of march  deferred tax assets included  of stock based compensation deductions as of march  compared to  as of march  these amounts could be subject to an internal revenue code section limitation 
we record provisions for income tax although we do not pay income tax other than alternative minimum tax 
results of operations the table shown below summarizes the percentage of revenue for the various items for the periods indicated period to period change percentage of revenue years ended march year ended march to to revenue product sales contract research and development total revenue cost of sales gross profit total expenses income from operations net interest and other income income before taxes income tax provision benefit net income total revenue for fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was due to an increase in product sales partially offset by a decrease in research and development revenue 
total revenue in fiscal decreased from revenue of  for the year ended march  the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to a decrease in research and development revenue partially offset by an increase in product sales 
product sales increased to  in fiscal  following a increase to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased sales of spintronic couplers and medical sensors 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was despite a decline in sales to st 
jude medical and an electronic industry inventory glut that we believe negatively impacted our sales in the quarter ended december  the decline in sales to st 
jude medical in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to st 
jude medical purchasing parts for inventory in fiscal as it expanded its use of our components 
contract research and development revenue decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal  which was an decrease from  for fiscal the decreases in both fiscal years were due to shifts to company funded research from contract funded research and a decrease in us government contract awards to us 
gross profit margin increased to of revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal from fiscal was due to a more profitable revenue mix consisting of a higher percentage of product sales and higher product margins due primarily to lower cost coupler designs 
the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal from fiscal was due to a more profitable revenue mix consisting of a higher percentage of product sales 
research and development expense increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal research and development expense increased for fiscal from  for fiscal the increases in both years were due to shifting resources to company funded research from contract funded research contracts 
company funded research and development programs included new spintronic sensor and coupler products 
selling  general  and administrative expense for fiscal decreased to  compared to  for fiscal the decrease was due to a strategic shift to distributors selling our products rather than manufacturers representatives 
this shift reduced commissions we paid and expenses associated with supporting manufacturers representatives 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expense for fiscal compared to  for fiscal was due to increased patent and auditing expenses  partially offset by lower personnel expenses 
interest income net of interest expense plus other income totaled  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal the increases in both years were due to increases in interest bearing investments  and a decrease in interest expense with debt reductions 
other income consisted primarily of gains from the sale of excess equipment  which fluctuated depending on the timing of such sales 
we recorded income before taxes of   and  for fiscal   and the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increases in product revenue and gross profit margin 
the decrease in income before taxes in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in research and development expense and a decrease in research and development revenue 
provision for income tax in fiscal was  compared to tax benefits of  and  for fiscal and the provision for income tax for fiscal was due to the exhaustion of our net operating losses in fiscal  although we did not pay significant cash taxes for fiscal because of stock based compensation deductions 
income tax benefits for fiscal and were from reductions of valuation allowances relating to deferred tax assets for tax return purposes 
net income for fiscal   and was   and  the increase in net income in fiscal compared to fiscal was despite a provision for income tax in fiscal rather than an income tax benefit in fiscal the decrease in net income for fiscal from fiscal was due to a decrease in research and development revenue  an increase in research and development expense  and a smaller income tax benefit 
weighted average diluted shares outstanding were   and  shares for fiscal   and the decrease for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the expiration of a warrant issued to cypress semiconductor corporation for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  partially offset by an increase from stock options issued and exercised 
earnings per diluted share were   and for fiscal   and diluted earnings per share for fiscal and fiscal were reduced by the dilutive effect of the warrant issued to cypress that expired early in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of working capital for fiscal years through were product sales and research and development contract revenue 
at march  we had  in cash and investments compared to  at march  the increase in cash and investments was primarily due to cash generated by operations and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in inventory 
accounts receivable decreased to  at march  from  at march  the decrease was due to payments received on research and development contracts 
we expect accounts receivable to tend to increase in the future as revenue increases 
inventory was  at march  compared to  at march  the increase was primarily due to increases in finished goods and work in process inventories to support increased product sales 
we expect inventories to tend to increase roughly in line with product sales 
the decrease in deferred revenue in fiscal was primarily due to our partial satisfaction of obligations relating to a prepayment under our agreement with agilent 
we had  in debt at march   consisting of a lease collateralized by production equipment that we expect to retire in june while we are not currently planning any additional borrowing  we may have the ability to borrow using certain of our production equipment assets as collateral if necessary 
capital expenditures were   and  in fiscal   and the larger expenditures in fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily to improve manufacturing efficiency  increase product manufacturing capacity  and provide redundancy for critical production equipment 
the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total we believe our working capital and cash generated from operations will be adequate for our needs at least through our fiscal year ending march  outlook in fiscal we plan to continue our business strategy  including developing new sensors and couplers  and pursuing new mram license agreements 
we expect product sales to continue to increase as we expand our customer base and our existing customers increase their purchases 
we expect contract research and development revenue to continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal as product sales increase and our emphasis continues to shift to company funded from contract funded research 
we expect gross profit margin to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower cost product designs deployed in fiscal  price increases for some of our products  and a planned shift in our revenue mix to product sales from research and development revenue 
our product sales generally have higher gross profit margins than our research and development revenue 
we do not expect to pay significant income taxes in fiscal  but we expect to continue to recognize provisions for income taxes due to our stock based compensation deductions for tax purposes 
unlike net operating loss carryforwards  stock based compensation deductions do not reduce taxes reported for book purposes when realized 
we plan to continue to evaluate capital investments as needs and opportunities arise 
we currently expect capital investments for fiscal to increase from a relatively low level in fiscal as we build production capacity to support product sales growth 
foreign currency transactions we have some limited revenue risks from fluctuations in values of foreign currency due to product sales abroad 
foreign sales are generally made in us currency  and currency transaction gains or losses in the past three fiscal years were not significant 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since our inception 
prices for our products and for the materials and labor going into those products are governed by market conditions 
it is possible that inflation in future years could impact both materials and labor in the production of our products 
rates paid by the us government for research and development contracts are generally adjustable with inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risks on cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities 
our investments in fixed rate debt securities  which were classified as available for sale as of march   have remaining maturities from one to months  and are exposed to the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
available for sale securities had a market value of  at march   representing of our total assets 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates applicable to fixed rate instruments maturing during the next twelve months that are subject to reinvestment risk 
as of march   our analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flow
