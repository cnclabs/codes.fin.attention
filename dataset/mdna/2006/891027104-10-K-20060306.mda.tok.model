item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
torchmark views its operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of torchmark s capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
torchmark s measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less interest credited to net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to torchmark s net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present torchmark s overall operations in the manner that management uses to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations torchmark s net income increased or million to million in  and or million to million in the growth in earnings in both periods came primarily from the life insurance segment  although the investment and health segments contributed significantly in health margins improved in  but were relatively flat in excess investment income declined for the first time in ten years in  compressed by a flattening yield curve in that year 
the life insurance segment added million to the increase in pretax earnings  and million to the increase 
the growth in life insurance resulted from margin improvements and premium growth  although there was a decline in sales volume 
growth in was also a result of increases in premium income and margins 
life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption life insurance 
pretax health profits rose in to million but rose in to million 
health premium declined in  as competition in torchmark s medicare supplement business has continued to dampen health sales 
health premium income rose in premium collected in the first policy year rose in  but declined in health underwriting margin was flat in after having improved in the improvements were largely a result of reductions in loss ratios on a closed block of cancer business 
this block had contributed to declines in margins in recent years prior to see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
torchmark has previously stated that it offers annuities  but does not plan to emphasize annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
see the caption annuities for further discussion 

table of contents the investment segment s pretax profitability declined million in after increasing million in and million in the low long term interest rates available for new investments since have caused torchmark s average portfolio yield to decline in each successive year  restricting growth in net investment income and excess investment income 
yields on new fixed maturity investments have been lower than the average portfolio yield since january  in and late  excess investment income was further compressed as short term rates rose with no meaningful change in long term rates 
the increase in short term rates caused short term financing costs to increase and the income spread on torchmark s fixed to variable interest rate swaps to narrow 
see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments for a more detailed discussion 
total revenues rose in to billion 
in  total revenues increased to billion from billion in the life premium increase was the primary contributor to revenue growth in both periods  although net investment income also contributed to the revenue growth in both periods 
in  torchmark had immaterial after tax realized investment gains compared with gains of million in and losses of million in under the caption realized gains and losses in this report  torchmark presents a complete analysis and discussion of its realized gains and losses 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  torchmark management does not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of its core insurance operations or its operating segments 
however  they can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
in each of the years through  torchmark s net income was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
torchmark management does not view these items as components of its core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
a discussion of these items follows 
in  torchmark recorded an after tax charge of thousand million pretax pertaining to litigation 
this litigation involved net settlements after expenses primarily in three significant legal matters torchmark s race distinct mortality dual pricing litigation  its class action cancer case  and the waddell reed litigation 
all of these cases relate to litigation arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to torchmark s current operations 
of this pre tax amount  million is recorded as other income and million is recorded as other operating expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
for more information on these litigation items  see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
also in  torchmark recorded a million settlement benefit from an internal revenue service examination covering several years 
more information on this tax settlement is provided in note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  a noncash after tax charge of thousand was recorded as a result of the extension in the term of a previously granted stock option for a senior officer upon retirement 
the option extension expense was recorded as administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the tax settlement reduced tax expense 
as of january   torchmark adopted statement of position sop  an accounting rule concerning guaranteed minimum policy benefits on variable annuities 
the adoption of this standard resulted in a one time after tax charge of million recorded as a change in accounting principle 
also  during  torchmark received a refund of state income taxes in the amount of million  after federal tax 
this refund resulted from the settlement of certain state tax issues concerning a discontinued operation in the mid s 
the refund reduced income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  net income was impacted by two nonrecurring items 
first  torchmark sold an airplane and recognized a pretax loss of 
million 
in the consolidated statements of operations  this item was included as an administrative expense 
secondly  the settlement of a federal tax issue resulted in interest due torchmark in the pretax amount of million 
this item was included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations 
because the tax issue covered a period of many years  the interest income on the tax refund exceeded the refund itself 
after expenses  the effect of the tax refund on earnings was immaterial 
significant gains or losses from non investment property or significant interest income from non investment sources are unusual for torchmark 

table of contents torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in and was reaffirmed at its july  board of director s meeting 
with no specified authorization amount  management determines the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the company s tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december  analysis of share purchases amounts in thousands purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow option proceeds total in  million shares at a cost of million related to the option restoration program more fully discussed under the caption capital resources 
throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
life insurance 
life insurance is torchmark s largest insurance segment 
its premium is also growing at a greater rate than the other insurance segments 
in  life premium represented of total premium  compared with in and in life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in  compared with in both and additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
life insurance premium rose to billion in and in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium by channel for each of the last three years is as follows 
life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies torchmark management uses four statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  annualized premium issued  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of growth in 
table of contents premium revenue 
annualized premium issued sold is that amount of annualized premium in force added from new sales in a given period  and is an indicator of the acceleration of premium growth 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
management believes that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to gross annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december  the following table sets forth net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance net sales by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total direct response american income exclusive agency liberty national exclusive agency military agency other agencies the direct response group is torchmark s leading writer of life insurance 
marketing is conducted primarily through direct mail  but also through co op mailings  television and consumer magazine advertising  and direct mail solicitations endorsed by groups  unions and associations 
this group markets a line of life products primarily to juveniles  their parents  and other adults over age the direct response operation accounted for almost of torchmark s life insurance premium during  the largest of any distribution group 
life premium rose in and in this group s focus is on its juvenile life product 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile insureds 
parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a solicitation by direct response for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juveniles and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
torchmark 
table of contents expects that sales to the juvenile market and their parents will continue as one of this group s premier markets 
management believes that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct response life insurance 
while the direct response group experienced strong growth in sales in and  as evidenced by increases in both net sales and first year collected premium  sales growth was not as strong in net sales rose in to million and in to million  but increased in to million 
first year collected premium grew in and in  but rose to million in it should be noted that the volumes measured by both of these indicators in exceeded comparable amounts in the two strong growth prior periods and 
due to the nature of torchmark s direct response business  the rate of sales growth can vary from year to year 
however  growth in direct response life premium has trended upward in a relatively stable manner  and the premium growth rate has averaged an increase of over the past ten years 
the american income exclusive agency focuses on members of labor unions  credit unions  and other associations for its life insurance sales 
it is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios 
life premium for this agency rose to million in  after having increased in net sales declined in to million from million in net sales were million in  resulting in a decrease of in first year collected premium also declined in  after having increased in and in as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  declining 
the agent count declined in from  at year end in its efforts to recruit new agents  torchmark recently implemented a new incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business 
additionally  the company continues to utilize its systematic  centralized internet recruiting program to add new agents 
the liberty national exclusive agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middle income customers in southeastern states  but has recently expanded into several other states 
liberty s life premium declined slightly in both and compared with the respective prior year 
annualized life premium in force was million at december   flat with after having declined in from life premium sales for this agency  in terms of net sales  were million in  representing a decrease of in after having decreased in first year collected premium declined in to million 
first year collected premium was flat in with the prior year at million 
growth in the liberty agency s sales and premium volume are highly dependent on growth in the agency force 
however  this agency has experienced volatility in its agency force in the past two years 
liberty had  producing agents at year end  compared with  at year end  an increase of 
but producing agents declined approximately in  the primary factor in sales declines in both and in the latter part of  the agent s compensation system was restructured to not only reward production and policy persistency  but also to encourage retention of productive agents 
however  the recruiting of new agents was neglected  a primary cause in the decline in agent count 
in late  liberty implemented initiatives similar to those of american income to recruit new agents  primarily through use of the internet 
the increase in producing agents is believed to have resulted from these efforts 
as these agents become more seasoned  they should become more productive 
management believes that the continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems 
management also expects that the increased sales from a larger and more productive agency force will lead to an acceleration in premium growth 
liberty s life underwriting margins have improved steadily over the past three years 
as a percentage of life premium  margins rose from in to in and then to in these margin improvements resulted primarily from the reductions in acquisition costs due to the above mentioned revisions in agents compensation 
improved persistency resulting from a change in collection procedure was also a factor 

table of contents torchmark s military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders and is characterized by low lapse rates 
in  life premium was million or of torchmark s total life premium 
premium increased in from million 
premium also rose in both and annualized premium in force rose in to million after an increase of in and in military net sales declined in to million 
these sales rose in first year collected premium declined in to million after an increase in of 
this agency s sales have been under pressure as it reorganizes its non life non torchmark products 
this reorganization included reduced commission rates on non torchmark investment products  and resulted in a loss of of this agency s producing agents appointed with torchmark in margins in the military group were negatively affected by hostilities in the middle east in all three periods  resulting in higher than expected benefits paid of million in  million in  and million in torchmark s other agencies consist of the united investors agency  the united american independent and branch office agencies  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the united investors agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business 
united investors represents approximately of torchmark s life premium income 
the loss of a significant marketing group in has had a negative impact on production in the united investors agency since that time 
the united american independent and branch office agencies combined represented approximately of torchmark s total life premium 
life premium income and sales for these two agencies has declined for the past three years because they focus on health insurance  with life sales being incidental 
life insurance summary of results dollar amounts in thousands amount of premium amount of premium amount of premium premium and policy charges policy obligations required interest on reserves net policy obligations commissions and premium taxes amortization of acquisition costs total expense insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expenses gross margins  as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense  rose in to million after rising in as a percentage of life insurance premium  gross margins have increased slightly each year 
improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors 
the previously mentioned changes in liberty s agent compensation system and premium collection method have contributed to notable increases in liberty s margins 
additionally  the percentage of american income premium to total premium continues to grow  and that has caused life margins to increase because that agency s margins are torchmark s highest  exceeding in direct response margins have grown to above in  as it has emphasized sales of its higher margin juvenile policy 

table of contents health insurance 
health products sold by torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited benefit hospital surgical plans  cancer  and accident plans sold to people under age  as well as medicare supplements sold to enrollees in the federal medicare program 
health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in  compared with in and in health underwriting margin accounted for of the total  compared with in and in these declines in the health percentages indicate the growth in torchmark s life segment in relation to the health segment 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years

over the past three years  torchmark has placed greater emphasis on the sale of limited benefit health insurance products rather than medicare supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited benefit hospital surgical plans has increased  and price competition and lesser demand for medicare supplements has dampened sales of that product 
while medicare supplement still remains torchmark s dominant health product in terms of premium income  the other limited benefit health products have been growing rapidly in their contribution to health premium 
as shown in the chart above  medicare supplement premium represented of total health premium in  but has declined steadily as a percentage of total health premium in each successive year 
accordingly  limited benefit health products have increased as a percentage of total health premium each year during the same period

as discussed above  the two united american agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limited benefit health plans known generally as hospital surgical plans for which demand has increased in recent years 
these plans provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined  a fixed amount surgical schedule  some out patient coverage  and other miscellaneous hospital related charges 
they also contain caps on total per illness benefits 
consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers 
minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited benefit plans are generally lower than those of medicare supplement  however  the medicare supplement product has higher persistency rates  resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium 
both of the united american agencies offer these limited benefit plans 
the united american branch office is an exclusive agency  meaning the agents in its offices nationwide sell only for the company 
in recent years  this agency has been successful in building sales of limited benefit plans to replace the decline in medicare supplement sales 
net sales of limited benefit plans in were million  a increase 
net sales in were million  a increase over as a result  total health sales at the ua branch office were million  a increase over  including the decline in medicare supplement sales 
premium from limited benefit plans at the ua branch office increased by to million in compared with  but total health premium remained 
table of contents relatively unchanged at million in  due to the slow decline in premium from the in force medicare supplement block 
health premium for increased from million in at year end  the ua branch office had  producing agents compared with  at year end  a increase 
this agency had  agents at year end the united american independent agency is composed of over  independent agencies whose size range from very large  multi state organizations down to one person offices  all of whom generally sell for a number of insurance companies 
in the recent past  most of this agency s health sales came from one large independent agency 
however  in  the ua independent agency s net health sales dropped by to million  reflecting an earlier disruption in that leading agency s recruiting and training program that resulted in a decline in producing agents 
while limited benefit premium of million at the ua independent agency was up compared with  medicare supplement premium of million declined 
the ua independent agency has the largest in force block of medicare supplement policies 
total health premium for at this agency was million  declining from  while premium of million was unchanged from liberty national exclusive agency  predominately a life insurance distribution channel  is the third largest writer of torchmark health business based on premium collected 
cancer supplemental plans are the limited benefit health products primarily produced by this agency and liberty is the only torchmark distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product 
approximately one half of the cancer block consists of a closed block of business which arose from a class action settlement in the mid s 
prior to  significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on the closed block were a continuing factor causing growth in health premium  but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins 
early in  liberty settled a class action lawsuit that arose over the timing and size of the rate increases on the closed block 
the settlement provides for claims incurred after the effective date of the settlement in early march to be paid on an actual incurred basis  rather than a billed basis  which management estimates will reduce benefits paid going forward 
it also provides for a grandfathered period for certain claimants that will allow them to be paid at billed rates for one year 
the settlement further requires liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business 
as a result  premiums are estimated to decline from about million per year prior to the settlement to about million in force when the settlement is fully phased in  assuming no lapsed policies 
prior to the settlement  liberty has had a claims loss ratio above on this block 
health premium at liberty declined to million in compared with because of the reduced premiums on the closed block of cancer business  as described above 
health premium of million remained unchanged from net health sales for increased to million compared with net health sales of million  which were up compared with american income exclusive agency  also predominately a life insurance distribution channel  is torchmark s fourth largest health insurance distributor based on premium collected 
its health plans are comprised of various limited benefit plans for which almost two thirds of the agency s health premium was from accident policies 
sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 
health premium for increased over to million  while premium of million increased over net health sales of million in declined compared with  but net sales of million increased over net health sales comprised only of american income agency s total net sales in direct response  primarily a life operation  also produces health insurance  which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups

for fixed annuities  net required interest on reserves is the required interest credited to the accounts and is offset by investment income 
for all three periods shown in the chart above  account balances declined  which resulted in reductions in policy fees and charges 
policy obligations also declined in each period 
in all three periods  investment income earned exceeded required interest credited to fixed accounts resulting in negative net required interest on reserves 
as a result  insurance underwriting margin for annuities before other income and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  but declined to million in margins were benefited by a decline in guaranteed minimum policy benefits in to million from million in  as a result of an increase in equity markets 
equity markets were more stable in administrative expenses 
torchmark s operating expenses  as included in the other and corporate segments  are classified in two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company 
a reconciliation of other operating expenses per the consolidated statements of operations to operating expenses per the segment analysis is as follows reconciliation of operating expenses amounts in thousands other operating expenses  per consolidated statements of operations expense related to settlement of prior period litigation option term extension expense for retiring executive loss on sale of airplane total operating expenses  per segment analysis as noted in the summary of operations in this discussion  the costs of settling certain significant litigation in relate to prior periods and are not considered by management to relate to current insurance operations

million in and million in  and losses of million in additionally  revenues in include a one time litigation settlement of million and revenues in also include a nonrecurring nonoperating interest income benefit of million related to interest received on a tax settlement 
because realized gains and losses and nonoperating items bear no relationship to core operations in the view of management  torchmark removes the effect of these items from revenue when evaluating expense ratios 
insurance administrative expenses as a percentage of premium and total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue rose slightly in both and the increase was primarily due to increased employee cost and a million payroll tax charge related to the option exercise and restoration program incurred in  which program is discussed under the caption capital resources in this report

see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the investment segment is responsible for the management of capital resources including investments  debt and cash flow 
excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations 
it is the measure that management uses to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
management also views excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing its share repurchase program in  torchmark has used over billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  management believes that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment 
excess investment income declined in to million from million in it increased in and in however  on a per diluted share basis  excess investment income rose to 
per share excess investment income increased in and in growth in excess investment income is impacted by increases in investment income due to the growth in the portfolio and changes in rates available in financial markets 
it is also affected by crediting rates on policy liabilities and changes in torchmark s borrowing costs 
additionally  share purchases in recent periods have caused excess investment income per share to grow faster than excess investment income 
the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  which rose to million in it rose to million in from million in included in investment income was a nonrecurring interest income item resulting from a tax settlement of million pretax 
management excludes nonrecurring items when it views investment income 
after excluding this item  investment income rose in as presented in the following chart  the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets 
growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost the lower growth in income is reflective of new investments made each year at long term yields lower than the portfolio s average yield  resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in recent years 
also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio  as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities 
given the sizeable annual cash flow from torchmark s operations  management expects mean invested assets to continue to grow  but as long as the current low interest rate environment continues  the rate of growth of investment income will be under pressure 
more detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under this caption 

table of contents excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 
interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities dollar amounts in millions interest credited average net insurance policy liabilities average crediting rate life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in excess investment income was positively affected by reduced crediting rates on certain policy liabilities in and in those years  the growth in interest credited to policy liabilities was not as great as the growth in the liabilities  as the company was able to respond to the low interest environment with reduced crediting rates on fixed annuities and certain life products 
while annuity crediting rates were reduced in  the company was not able to further reduce life and health crediting rates 
for more information on life and health crediting rates  please refer to note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on torchmark s various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

analysis of financing costs amounts in thousands interest on funded debt interest on short term debt other reclassification of interest due to deconsolidation subtotal of interest expense benefit from interest rate swaps financing costs financing costs rose or million in they increased or million in both the and increases primarily resulted from the expiration in september of a profitable interest rate swap  on which torchmark had earned over million per quarter during the first three quarters of and the full year the interest rate swaps are agreements between torchmark and certain banks for which torchmark receives from the banks fixed rate payments that match the coupons that it pays to its debt holders  and makes floating rate payments based on libor rates to the banks 
while new swaps were entered into in august of  the spreads on the new swaps were not as great as the expired swap  and accounted for more than a million reduction in swap benefit per quarter when compared against the expired swap 
these new swaps were sold in september  because of a change in management s outlook for short term rates 
during the thirteen month period the swaps were held  torchmark earned approximately million in reduced interest cost 
also affecting financing costs in the latter part of and the full year were rising short term rates 
these rising rates reduced the positive effect of torchmark s other swaps and increased short term borrowing costs 
a full description of these swaps is disclosed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
torchmark s investment strategy is to maintain a positive spread between the yield on investments and the yield on the interest bearing policy liabilities and debt 
it is this positive spread that results in excess investment income 
at the same time  torchmark desires to invest predominately in investment grade corporate fixed maturities 
in prolonged periods of low long term interest rates  maintaining sufficient spread while limiting new investments to high quality securities becomes more challenging 
torchmark addressed this issue of low long term rates prior to by lengthening the maturities of new investment purchases to maximize the yield  and by revising the crediting rates downward on various products 
even though yields on new long term investments declined  there was still a significant spread of long term yields over short term yields 

table of contents however  the lower long term interest rates combined with rising short term rates experienced in late and have restricted the growth of excess investment income 
as the yield curve flattened  with rising short term rates but with no meaningful change in long term rates  compensation for investing long term has been significantly diminished 
therefore  in mid  torchmark revised its investment strategy to shorten the maturity of most new investments  while maintaining its policy to acquire only investment grade securities 
the company believes that investing in shorter term maturities is the best strategy because the reduced spreads between long and short maturities are not enough to justify investing solely in long term bonds 
the lower yields could result in reduced excess investment income spreads over the short term 
in the event of an increase in long term rates  excess investment income will benefit as new acquisitions can be made at higher yields 
while higher short term rates will increase floating rate financing costs  higher long term rates would be to torchmark s advantage because the amount of cash invested annually significantly exceeds the amount of floating rate debt  and would result in greater investment income net of financing costs under most yield curve scenarios 
at any rate  excess investment income has grown significantly in each of the four years prior to and has exceeded fifty percent of net investment income in every year since acquisitions 
the chart below presents selected information about torchmark s fixed maturity acquisitions in the years through investment grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust preferred securities classified as redeemable preferred stocks with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors 
both yield and average life calculations on new purchases on noncallable bonds are based on the maturity date 
in the case of callable bonds  the average life is based on the call date or maturity date  whichever produces the lowest yield yield to worst 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities other investment grade securities below investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions average yield effective annual yield average life in years  to worst call torchmark continues to invest exclusively in investment grade bonds 
as previously discussed  torchmark attempted to maximize yield on new investments in the low interest environment in   and early by lengthening maturities 
as a result  the average life of new fixed maturity acquisitions was years in and years in  and the effective annual yield on new investments was in and in in  however  as torchmark s investment strategy changed  the effective annual yield on new investments declined to and the average life fell to years 
management believes that because of the long term  fixed rate characteristics of its policy liabilities  the company does not have to strictly match assets and liabilities 
new cash flow available to torchmark for investment has been greatly affected by issuer calls as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past few years 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  but they negatively affect portfolio yield  as they cause torchmark to replace higher yielding bonds with those available at lower prevailing yields 
calls increased during and but declined somewhat in issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in as long as the yields on new fixed maturity acquisitions remain below the overall portfolio yield  the portfolio yield will slowly decline as will investment income and excess investment income 
as discussed above  however  because of the sizeable annual cash flow generated from operations  management believes the company will be well positioned when investment interest rates eventually rebound 

table of contents portfolio analysis 
torchmark s emphasis has been on bond investments over alternative investments 
therefore  the relative percentage of torchmark s investments by type varies from industry norms

table of contents credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
in weak economic periods  the securities of industry sectors affected by the economic downturn suffer increased credit risk 
as a result  securities in these weakened sectors could be downgraded by credit rating agencies to below investment grade status 
thus  the likelihood the issuers will honor their securities terms is reduced and the securities market values can be negatively impacted 
as torchmark continues to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
torchmark mitigates this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring investment grade bonds  and by investigating the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
torchmark continues to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
at december   approximately of invested assets at fair value were held in fixed maturity securities 
the major rating agencies considered of this portfolio to be investment grade 
the average quality rating of the portfolio continues to be bbb 
the table below demonstrates the credit rankings of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio at fair value as of december  rating amounts in millions aaa aa a bbb bb b less than b not rated torchmark s current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 
torchmark additionally reduces credit risk by maintaining investments in a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the industry sectors that exceeded of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio at fair value at december  industry insurance carriers depository institutions electric  gas  sanitation services nondepository credit institutions finance communications chemicals allied products media transportation equipment oil gas extraction food kindred products petroleum refining related industries industrial  commercial machinery  computer equipment otherwise  no individual industry represented or more of torchmark s corporate fixed maturities 
market risk sensitivity 
the primary market risk to which torchmark s financial securities are exposed is interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since torchmark s portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  it is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates in recent years have generally resulted in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the 
table of contents portfolio 
however  torchmark does not expect to realize these unrealized gains because it is generally the company s investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity 
the company s strategy would be the same should markets reverse and market rates increase placing the fixed income portfolio in an unrealized loss position 
the long term nature of torchmark s insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to declines in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of torchmark s interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of torchmark s fixed maturity portfolio 
the data are prepared through a model which incorporates various assumptions and estimates to measure the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
it takes into account the effect that special option features such as call options  put options  and unscheduled repayments could have on the portfolio  given the changes in rates 
the valuation of these option features is dependent upon assumptions about future interest rate volatility that are based on past performance 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  realized gains and losses 
as a group of life and health insurance carriers  torchmark collects premium income from its policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  torchmark also incurs acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of its insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  torchmark  as a part of its core insurance operations  holds a significant investment portfolio 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
because torchmark holds this large and diverse investment portfolio  investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
torchmark does not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield or which are beyond the control of management are only secondary to torchmark s core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
unlike investment income  they are not considered in determining premium rates or product profitability of torchmark s insurance products 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  however  and as a result  have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause period to period trends of net income to not be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as management 
table of contents views its operations 
for these reasons  torchmark management removes the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating its overall insurance operating results 
the following table summarizes torchmark s tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of after tax realized gains losses amounts in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share realized gains losses  net of tax  from investment sales and calls writedown of fixed maturities writedown of other investments valuation of interest rate swaps spread on interest rate swaps total the reduction in interest cost from swapping fixed rate obligations to floating rate 
in both and  torchmark wrote down several individual holdings to estimated fair value as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met some or all of torchmark s criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in its critical accounting policies in this report 
pretax charges for these impairments were million in and million in regarding all bonds previously written down  the bonds of issuers were still held at december  at a fair value of million and a recorded book value of million 
accounting rules require torchmark to value its interest rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period 
the fair values of these instruments fluctuate with interest rates in financial markets and diminish with the passage of time so that their value will be zero when they ultimately expire 
these period to period fluctuations can be substantial 
however  torchmark management does not consider these period to period fluctuations in value in managing its ongoing operations because their cumulative result will be zero if held to expiration 
these temporary unrealized changes in swap values are included as a component of realized investment gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
this fair value adjustment for all swaps on an after tax basis was a negative million in and  compared with a negative million in torchmark has historically held its swaps to maturity 
however  in the third quarter of  two swaps were sold because of an expectation of higher short term rates in the future 
the swaps sold were the million notional amount related to the senior debentures and the million notional amount associated with the notes 
proceeds of thousand were received on the sales 
the securities and exchange commission s accounting guidance currently requires that all income and expenses related to a nonhedged derivative be recorded in the same line item on the income statement that the adjustment to fair value is recorded 
therefore  torchmark combines the cash settlements on nonhedged swaps with the noncash unrealized fair value adjustment as a component of realized investment gains and losses 
additionally  torchmark includes the cash settlements on its hedged swap derivatives in realized investment gains and losses for consistency 
torchmark s pretax interest cost reduction from these cash settlements included in realized investment gains was a positive million in  a positive million in  and a positive million in torchmark continues to reduce interest cost for this benefit in its segment analysis  because the segment analysis is required by gaap to be as management evaluates the performance of the segment 
torchmark views the benefit from lower interest rates as a reduction in its financing costs in its investment segment 

table of contents financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
torchmark s liquidity is derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
torchmark s insurance operations have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of its immediate needs 
sources of cash flows from operations include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
operating cash inflows significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers  such as torchmark  expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods  sometimes many years later 
a liability is actuarially computed and recorded for these future benefits which increases as insurance in force grows so that torchmark can save for these future payments 
earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period  but there is no corresponding cash outlay 
therefore  cash provided from operations is generally expected to significantly exceed net income in any given period 
cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of torchmark s investment portfolio 
cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements 
available cash flows are also used to repay debt  to buy back torchmark shares  to pay shareholder dividends  and for other corporate uses 
while torchmark s cash flows have historically been positive and very strong  a material reduction in cash flow could negatively affect its liquidity 
cash flows provided from operations increased in each of the three years ended december  over their respective prior year 
they were million in  million in  and million in in addition  torchmark received million in investment maturities  repayments  and calls in  adding to available cash flows 
such repayments were million in and million in torchmark has in place a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
for a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
torchmark s cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  torchmark has a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  torchmark s strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
liquidity of the parent company is affected by the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends 
the parent receives dividends from subsidiaries in order to meet dividend payments on common and preferred stock  interest and principal repayment requirements on parent company debt  and operating expenses of the parent company 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as fully described and discussed in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark has outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities 
the capital trusts which are liable for these securities are the legal entities which are responsible for the securities and facilitate the payment of dividends to shareholders 
they are off balance sheet arrangements which torchmark is required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules 
deconsolidation is required by accounting rules because they are considered to be variable interest entities in which torchmark has no variable interest 
therefore torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity  even though it owns all of the entity s voting equity 
while these liabilities are not on torchmark s balance sheet  they are represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trusts 
these junior subordinated debentures are a torchmark liability of million par and book value at both december  and 
table of contents december  and are indicated as a capital resource to torchmark under the caption capital resources in this report 
the preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by torchmark s interest payment on its debt to the trusts 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  torchmark has guaranteed the performance of the capital trusts to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
pension obligations to torchmark s employees are obligations of trust fund entities which are not reflected on torchmark s balance sheet 
the obligations of these trusts are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
these trust entities hold assets which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the pension obligations as they become due 
during  torchmark subsidiary american income entered into an agreement to guarantee certain personal loans of american income employees and agents with first command bank 
first command bank is a subsidiary of first command financial services  inc first command of which lamar c 
smith is chairman and ceo 
he is also a director of torchmark 
at december   the balance subject to this guarantee was thousand 
these guarantees are secured by vested commissions due the employees and agents 
see note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on this guarantee 
as of december   torchmark had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of torchmark s guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee and the first command bank guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
all of torchmark s derivative instruments were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
the following table presents information about payments under torchmark s contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable long term debt principal long term debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations future insurance obligations total interest on debt is based on torchmark s fixed contractual obligations 
as certain debt instruments have related swaps which exchange fixed obligations to those based on floating rates  torchmark s actual interest cost may be greater or lesser than presented 
at december   torchmark had in place swaps with a notional amount of million on its million of long term debt at par value 
more information about torchmark s swaps is found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are not reflected on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities  consisting of investments of million and unrecognized losses of million 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations 

table of contents capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trusts which are liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
in connection with these instruments  torchmark had in place two interest rate swap agreements at december   but also had two swap agreements that were sold in september  and another swap agreement which expired in september  all of these agreements were entered into to exchange torchmark s fixed rate obligations on the debt instruments to floating rates 
information about these swaps is also found in note the carrying value of torchmark s senior notes is adjusted each period to reflect the change in fair value of a swap instrument which hedges the value of the note 
this swap increased the value of long term debt by 
million and million at december  and december   respectively 
additionally  torchmark entered into a swap agreement on its senior debentures in august  which qualified as a fair value hedge on that security 
that swap was disposed of in september  it increased the value of long term debt by million at december  torchmark maintains a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support its insurance policyholders liabilities 
torchmark is required by an accounting rule sfas to revalue this portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio result from changes in interest rates in financial markets 
while sfas requires invested assets to be revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner 
due to the size of torchmark s policy liabilities in relation to its shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact in the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of torchmark s shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
for this reason  torchmark s management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of sfas when analyzing torchmark s balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 

table of contents the following tables present selected data related to torchmark s capital resources

in the second quarter of  torchmark executed a voluntary stock option exercise and restoration program in which directors  employees and consultants exercised vested options of the company s common stock and received a lesser number of new options at the current market price 
as a result  the company issued million new shares to the participants 
however  a substantial number of the new shares were immediately sold through the open market by the participants to cover the option exercise price of their new shares and their related income taxes 
as a result of the program  management s ownership in torchmark increased and the company received a significant tax benefit from the exercise of the options 
torchmark received million in proceeds for the exercise price and million in tax benefits  both of which added to shareholder s equity 
however  as previously mentioned  torchmark generally uses the proceeds of option exercises to repurchase shares on the open market to reduce the dilution caused by option exercises 
as a result  the total impact on shareholder s equity and cash flow from the transaction was immaterial 
more information on stock options and this program is found in note significant accounting policies and in note stock options in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as previously mentioned  torchmark s board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the company s stock repurchase program in july  in amounts and timing that management  in consultation with the board  determined to be in the best interest of the company 
torchmark has repurchased its common stock every year since  except for  the year following the acquisition of american income 
since the beginning of  torchmark has repurchased million shares at a total cost of billion  and has acquired no fewer than million shares in any one year 
management believes that torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings  return on equity  and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value 
as noted earlier in this report  torchmark acquired million shares at a cost of million in with excess cash flow 
if the million free cash flow used for the repurchase of torchmark common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds  an estimated million of additional investment income  after tax  would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have increased to 
because share purchases were made  actual net income per share was  an increase of 
torchmark intends to continue the repurchase of its common shares when financial markets are favorable 

table of contents credit ratings 
the credit quality of torchmark s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies

transactions with related parties information regarding related party transactions is found in note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries continue to be named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at liberty in alabama 
such punitive damage claims are tried in alabama state courts where any punitive damage litigation may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that torchmark subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
bespeaking caution is the fact that it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
it is thus difficult to predict with certainty the liability of torchmark or its subsidiaries in any given case because of the unpredictable nature of this type of litigation 
based upon information 
table of contents presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by management to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
new unadopted accounting rules stock option expensing stock options have been granted to executives  employees  consultants  and directors as a form of compensation to provide motivation and to align the interests of these groups with the same interests of shareholders 
because they are generally granted at the fair value of torchmark stock at the date of grant  the value of these options increases as the value of torchmark stock increases 
the cost of these options to the company is in the dilution caused by the assumed exercise of the options  as the grantees ownership of the company grows in relation to that of existing shareholders 
this dilution cost has historically been reflected in per share earnings in the financial statements under the intrinsic value method currently permitted by gaap and used by torchmark 
under this method  a value is assigned to an option only if the exercise price is less than the fair value of the stock at the date of grant 
because torchmark s options are generally granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of torchmark stock  torchmark has historically incurred no option expense 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement r  share based payment  originally effective for torchmark as of july  but later deferred by the securities and exchange commission to january  the provisions of this statement will require torchmark to record an expense in the financial statements for stock options based on the fair value method  whereby a value is assigned to each option granted and to recognize an expense as this value is amortized over the period that the option vests 
this expense will be deducted from earnings and earnings per share in addition to the option cost already being reflected in the dilution computation described above 
gaap rules currently require torchmark to disclose in note significant accounting policies the impact on earnings on a pro forma basis as if the fair value method were in effect 
please refer to note for more details on the impact of adoption of this revised statement 
as explained in note  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to materially alter its methodology of computing option expense or that future results will vary significantly from the pro forma results disclosed for prior periods 
at the present time  torchmark does not plan to change its policies of stock option compensation because of the adoption of this revised statement 
while restatement of prior periods is permitted  the statement also permits a modified prospective method of adoption  whereby the expense of all unvested options as of january  and options granted after january  are expensed in accordance with the statement after that date 
torchmark will elect the modified prospective method of adoption 
the fair value assigned to option grants is derived from complex option pricing models using subjective assumptions such as price volatility and expected term 
considerable judgment is sometimes involved in the determination of these assumptions  which must be made at the time of option grant 
variations in actual experience versus the assumptions can cause material differences in an option s actual value when it is ultimately exercised versus its expense recorded in the financial statements 
however  while a variety of pricing models are acceptable under the statement  torchmark plans to use the black scholes pricing model used for the pro forma disclosures  with assumptions most reflective of torchmark s experience 
statement r does not permit the recorded expense to be adjusted to reflect actual experience 
earnings per share as described in note significant accounting policies  diluted earnings per share include the dilution resulting from the potential conversion of dilutive securities such as stock options into torchmark common stock 
the potential dilution from stock options has traditionally been calculated using the treasury stock method required by gaap 
this method assumes that torchmark uses the funds derived from the assumed exercise of options to buy treasury stock  thus reducing the net number of new shares outstanding resulting from the exercise 

table of contents the issuance by the fasb of statement r  requiring the expensing of stock options  revises the method of computing dilutive shares 
the revised method does not allow the traditional treasury stock method which simulates cash flow  but instead limits cash receipts from the tax benefit and injects a hypothetical concept known as unrecognized option expense to the dilution model 
as a result  diluted shares outstanding under the new standard will bear no relationship to diluted shares outstanding under the historical model or to a pattern that the company could actually replicate with its cash flow as before 
management does not believe that these modifications to the treasury stock method will materially impact earnings per share 
impairments of investments the fasb issued fasb staff position fas and fas the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  effective for torchmark january  this statement clarifies certain previously unresolved issues regarding accounting for investment impairments

because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  torchmark s insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
while management and company actuaries have used their best judgment in determining the assumptions and in calculating the liability for future policy benefits  there is no assurance that the estimate of the liabilities reflected in the financial statements represents torchmark s ultimate obligation 
additionally  because of the size of this liability  significantly different assumptions could result in materially different reported amounts 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption value of insurance purchased 
torchmark s policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
different assumptions with regard to deferred acquisition costs could produce materially different amounts of amortization 
for more information about accounting for deferred acquisition costs see note deferred acquisition costs and value of insurance purchased in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to the company 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation  the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
torchmark management believes that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be torchmark s ultimate obligation 
revenue recognition 
premium income for torchmark s subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected 
however  in accordance with gaap  revenue on limited payment contracts and universal life type contracts deposit balance products are recognized differently 
revenues on limited payment contracts are recognized over the contract period 
premium for 
table of contents deposit balance products  such as torchmark s annuity and interest sensitive life policies  is added to the policy account value 
the policy account value or deposit balance is a torchmark liability 
this deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance  administration  surrender  and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder 
in each case  benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned 
investment income is reported as revenue by torchmark when it is earned  less investment expenses 
the investment activities of torchmark are integral to its insurance operations 
because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future  the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested 
anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates  contract liabilities  and other product contract features 
these yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on torchmark s net insurance liabilities future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs and contractual interest obligations in its insurance and annuity products

impairment of investments 
torchmark continually monitors its investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value 
while the values of the investments in torchmark s portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an investment is considered to be impaired only when it has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that torchmark uses to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
torchmark maintains funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
it also has unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
torchmark s obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are partially offset by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining torchmark s obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in torchmark s pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
these assumptions are subjective in many cases and small changes in certain assumptions may cause material differences in reported results 
while management has used its best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  no assurance can be given that actual results will be the same as expected 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to the company 
torchmark s discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  funded status  and other related data
