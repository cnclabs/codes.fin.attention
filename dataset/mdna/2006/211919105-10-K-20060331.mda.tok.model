item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company principally earns revenues from the licensing of its software products and the provision of services in deployment of the company s technology to government agencies and commercial businesses throughout north america  europe and other parts of the world 
the company licenses its software to end users directly and also distributes its software products through license agreements with value added resellers  system integrators  original equipment manufacturers and other strategic partners 
revenues are generated from software licenses with customers and from the related sale of product maintenance  training and professional services 
additions to the number of authorized users  licenses issued for additional products and the renewal of product maintenance arrangements by customers pursuant to existing licenses also provide revenues to the company 
under software maintenance contracts  customers are typically entitled to receive telephone support  software bug fixes and upgrades or enhancements of particular software products when and if they are released 
with respect to the company s excalibur web offering  revenues may be derived from either a license model as described  or from a hosted service offering 
the company believes its retrievalware product has unique capabilities supporting the needs of customers within government agencies that will enable it to capitalize on current market opportunities and achieve its operational goals 
going forward  the company expects to focus a substantial amount of resources on further penetration of the national security  defense  law enforcement and intelligence gathering community with the united states and its allies 
an important objective in this market is to upgrade existing installations of older versions of retrievalware to the retrievalware platform that includes technical advancements such as categorization  dynamic classification  profiling and distributed indexing software capabilities 
further  the company expects to increase its development  selling marketing efforts with regard to its excalibur web offering 
excalibur is an advanced effort aimed at applying portions of the company s existing technology to searching and indexing contextually relevant information on the web 
the company launched the excalibur platform on november  and has begun to focus on creating distribution channels for this new technology 
in concert with the excalibur web offering  convera has entered into a hosting facility agreement with at t and as of january   has established two hosting centers san diego  ca and dallas  tx 
the company will look to focus a majority of its selling and marketing efforts on the government and intelligence gathering community as well as the media and publishing sector for the excalibur web offering 
this selling and marketing strategy is designed to capitalize on the alignment between customer requirements seeking both intranet and web based search and categorization technologies 
operating costs for this advanced development effort totaled approximately million for fiscal  while capital expenditures totaled approximately million for the year ended january  going forward  cash outlays will be limited to equipment  personnel and general operating costs  including marketing activities 
the company expects to continue to increase its investment in excalibur and may also elect to seek additional funding sources for this effort 
the company may also elect to seek additional and or alternative market segments for the excalibur offering over the coming quarters 
management s primary objective is to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations without hampering development  sales and marketing efforts 
the company is committed to investing in the enhancement of its products to meet the needs of its customers and prospects 
to achieve its main objective  the company continually evaluates revenue opportunities to determine the market sectors in which the company should concentrate its sales and marketing efforts 
the company s business environment and the search software industry in general are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  changes in customer requirements and emerging new market segments 
the company competes within the commercial sector where its market position has not been as strong as it has been within the government sector 
as such  the company has elected to focus the majority of its efforts within the commercial setting on the media and publishing sectors 
the company believes this segment may afford greater opportunities when compared to addressing a wide array of commercial market segments 
the company s competitors include many companies that are larger and more established and have substantially more resources 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
to address the competition  the company will continue to invest in research and development to advance its leadership position in linguistic analysis  scalability  performance  and taxonomy development and deployment 
the company may also make additional investments in specific product features to better serve the needs of customers looking for online customer service and support solutions and with regard to the excalibur web offering  may elect to create a public search portal 

table of contents in and  the company s results of operations were impacted by the general downturn in the economy  which resulted in a lengthier sales cycle  particularly in the commercial marketplace 
further  reduced information technology budgets and customer cash constraints caused by the difficult business environment negatively impacted our business 
through a number of reorganizations during fiscal years through  the company aligned its resources in an effort to ensure it continued to capitalize on markets that have been consistently successful  including the federal government  and to focus its resources on those areas of the commercial sector that present vertical market opportunities 
the reorganizations  which are described in this section and elsewhere in this form k  were intended to streamline the professional services  customer support and sales organizations by reducing the number of employees  improve the productivity of each of those organizations and reduce management personnel and other overhead costs in the marketing  development and administrative organizations within the company 
on august   the company announced that it further streamlined its expense structure 
as part of the restructuring  the company reduced its personnel related costs  eliminated certain marketing programs  renegotiated real estate obligations and decreased other general operating expenses 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  during the third quarter of fiscal related to this effort 
further  on december  the company announced an additional re alignment of its operational infrastructure 
this action included a general workforce reduction including the transfer of certain resources to the company s excalibur web offering  facility consolidations  reduced marketing related expenses and decreased other general operating costs 
as part of this restructuring  the company also announced that it would increase its focus on accelerating its excalibur development activities and would seek to advance the company s existing presence in the high end search market  specifically within the government and intelligence gathering community as well as the media and publishing sectors 
the company recorded a net restructuring charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to this effort 
the company will continue to invest in its excalibur web offering  such that on a consolidated basis  the company is expected to remain in a net loss position until such time as excalibur is accepted into the commercial marketplace and certain levels of revenue are attained 
a detailed review of the numerous risks and challenges facing the company is contained in the risk factors section beginning on page critical accounting policies convera s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
convera does not have any material ownership interest in any entities that are not wholly owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the company 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases those estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring costs  income taxes and litigation  on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
convera believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition convera s recognition of revenues requires judgment  particularly in the areas of collectibility and whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time the sales are made 
the company bases its judgment on a variety of factors  including the payment and other terms of the individual customer contracts  credit history of the customer  prior dealings with specific customers  and certain other factors 
if the company determines that the price under the contract is fixed and determinable  and that collectibility is reasonably assured  then the company recognizes revenue related to the software license at the time of sale 
to the extent the company determines that the price of a sales agreement is not fixed  the company delays revenue recognition until payments under the contract become due 
alternatively  to the extent the company determines that the collection of payments under the contract is not reasonably assured  the company delays revenue recognition until the payments under the contract are received 
thus  the assessment as to whether the fee is fixed and determinable at the time of sale and that the fees are collectible is critical in determining the extent of the revenue recognized in a given period 

table of contents the revenue associated with other elements of the contract  such as maintenance  training and professional services  are deferred and recognized as those elements are delivered 
generally  the company receives payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are non refundable 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
customization work is sometimes required to ensure that the company s software functionality meets the requirements of its customers 
in those instances where the company s revenues are generated from fixed price contracts related to this customization work  then revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these cost estimates underlie the company s determinations as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
further  the company believes that this method of recognition is closely aligned with the evolution of the work product as defined 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
hosted service revenues associated with the excalibur web offering are recognized straight line over the term of the applicable service agreement 
provision for doubtful accounts convera maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on an analysis of the company s historical collection experience and the company s portfolio of customers taking into consideration the general economic environment as well as the industry in which the company operates 
to the extent convera does not recognize deterioration in its customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent convera does not accurately estimate its customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other intangible assets convera s prior acquisitions of other companies resulted in the acquisition of certain intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill resulting from these acquisitions is associated with the company s core software products reporting segment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the impairment of goodwill is assessed on an annual basis or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value 
this assessment is performed by comparing the market value of the company s outstanding common stock with the carrying amount of the company s net assets 
if the market value exceeds the carrying amount of the company s net assets  impairment of goodwill does not exist 
if the market value is less than the carrying amount of the company s net assets  the company will perform further analysis and may be required to record an impairment 
the company evaluates all of its long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of the company s assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 

table of contents deferred taxes convera records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of projected future taxable income 
if the estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in a benefit or a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
as of january   the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  allows companies to account for stock based compensation either under the provisions of sfas no 
or under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  as amended by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

the company has elected to account for its stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb stock options originally granted under the company s stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and accordingly no employee compensation cost related to the initial grant of options is included in expenses 
stock option modifications associated with a change in employee status to a nonemployee have been accounted for as a new award and measured using the intrinsic value method under apb  resulting in the inclusion of compensation expense in the january  consolidated statement of operations 
nonvested shares of stock referred to as deferred stock granted under the company s stock option plan are measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of the company s common stock 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the corresponding service period 
if an employee leaves the company prior to the vesting of the deferred stock  the estimate of compensation expense recorded in previous periods is adjusted by decreasing compensation expense in the period of forfeiture
