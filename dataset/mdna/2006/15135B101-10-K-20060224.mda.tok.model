over the last years we have experienced strong growth in our medicaid managed care segment including membership growth of 
highlights of our growth include the following acquisitions or new contracts during the third quarter of we were awarded medicaid contracts in georgia by the georgia department of community health 
our subsidiary  peach state health plan  inc  will manage care for a portion of the medicaid and schip recipients in the atlanta  central and southwest regions 
membership operations are scheduled to commence in effective may   we acquired certain medicaid related assets of summacare  inc for approximately million

the results of operations of this entity are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning december  effective september   we commenced operations under our exclusive provider organization epo contract in texas providing managed care for schip recipients in rural texas counties 
effective january   we commenced operations in ohio through the acquisition of the medicaid related assets of family health plan  inc fhp for a purchase price of million

effective january   we began performing under our contract with the state of kansas to facilitate the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services to behavioral health recipients in kansas 

table of contents results of operations and key metrics summarized comparative financial data for  and are as follows in millions change change premium revenue service revenue total revenues medical costs cost of services general and administrative expenses earnings from operations investment and other income  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense minority interest net earnings diluted earnings per common share revenues and revenue recognition we generate revenues in our medicaid managed care segment primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
some contracts allow for additional premium related to certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data 
these adjustments are immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 
we generate revenues in our specialty services segment under contracts with states and local government entities  our health plans and third party customers 
revenues are recognized when the services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 
for performance based contracts  we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 
such amounts are recorded as unearned revenue 
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue 
premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have increased our total revenue each year primarily through membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment  premium rate increases  and growth in our specialty services segment 

table of contents membership growth from december  to december   we increased our membership by

specialty services segment growth in  we began performing under our behavioral health contracts with the states of arizona and kansas 
at december   our behavioral health company  cenpatico  provided behavioral health services to  members in arizona   members in kansas and  members through contracts with our health plans compared to  members through contracts with our health plans at december  additionally  in july we began offering disease management services through our acquisition of airlogix 

table of contents operating expenses medical costs our medical costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims 
medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including inpatient hospital utilization data and prior claims experience 
as part of this review  we also consider the costs to process medical claims and estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in physician billing patterns  membership  products and inpatient hospital trends 
these estimates are adjusted as more information becomes available 
we utilize the services of independent actuaries who are contracted to review our estimates quarterly 
while we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is actuarially sound  we cannot assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 
our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses related to health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred 
our hbr represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category year ended december  medicaid and schip ssi specialty services our medicaid and schip hbr increased in due to our settlement of a lawsuit with aurora health care  inc  which increased our ratio by  and expansion into new markets previously unmanaged by us  which increased our ratio by 
for example  we experienced higher cost trends in indiana where we added membership in as the state expanded their medicaid managed care program to include all medicaid and schip enrollees 
our specialty services ratio includes the behavioral health contracts in arizona and kansas and reflects the state of arizona s minimum hbr requirements 
our medicaid and schip hbr decreased in from due primarily to initiatives to reduce inappropriate emergency room usage and to establish preferred drug lists 
cost of services our cost of services expenses include all direct costs to support the local functions responsible for generation of our services revenues 
these expenses primarily consist of the salaries and wages of the physicians  clinicians  therapists and teachers who provide the services and expenses related to facilities and equipment used to provide services 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses primarily reflect wages and benefits and other administrative costs related to health plans  specialty companies and our centralized functions that support all of our business units 
our major centralized functions are finance  information systems and claims processing 
premium taxes are classified as g a expenses 
g a expenses increased in primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth  especially in arizona  georgia  kansas and missouri 

table of contents our g a expense ratio represents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 
the following table sets forth the general and administrative expense ratios by business segment and in total year ended december  medicaid managed care specialty services the decrease in the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio in reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues and lower compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans 
these factors were partially offset by implementation costs in georgia of million  higher spending on information systems process improvements and increased charitable contributions 
premium taxes totaled million in  increasing the ratio by 
the increase in the medicaid managed care g a expense ratio in reflects the impact of premium taxes enacted in september in texas and july in new jersey 
these taxes totaled million in and million in and had the effect of increasing our g a expense ratio by in and in additionally  the results include start up costs associated with the texas epo contract  our claims processing facility in montana and firstguard  severance costs related to job eliminations  and higher compensation costs related to our performance bonus plans 
the specialty services g a ratio varies depending on the nature of the services provided and will have a higher general and administrative expense ratio than the medicaid managed care segment 
the results reflect the operations of our behavioral health company in arizona  including million in implementation costs  and million in georgia implementation costs 
the results were affected by expenses associated with transitioning certain activities within specialty services  including closing costs of our clinic facilities in texas and california as cenpatico fully transitioned to a third party service model for behavioral health services  due diligence costs related to a potential transaction we decided not to pursue  and costs related to investing in new business opportunities 
other income expense other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments and interest expense on our debt 
investment and other income increased million in as a result of higher average investment balances and an increase in market interest rates 
interest expense increased million from increased borrowings under our credit facility and mortgages 
income tax expense our effective tax rate in was  compared to in the decrease was primarily due to a lower state income tax expense resulting from the resolution of state income tax examinations and the recognition of deferred tax benefits related to a change in law during the third quarter of this change was recorded in our operating results in the period known 
earnings per share and shares outstanding our earnings per share calculations in reflect higher basic weighted average shares outstanding resulting from the shares issued upon exercise of stock awards and the shares issued for the acquisition of assets from summacare  inc our earnings per share calculations in reflect an increase in the weighted average shares primarily resulting from  common shares sold in august 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in cash flow from operations in reflects an increase in premium and related receivables and a million increase in medical claims liabilities 
the increase in receivables resulted primarily from the timing of delivery receivable collections 
the increase in medical claims liabilities  lower than in prior years  reflects the million payment made to aurora health care  inc to settle a lawsuit  information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect of our behavioral health contract in arizona 
during  the increase in operating cash flow was due primarily to continued profitability  increases in membership and increases in medical claims liabilities 
our investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in during  our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisitions of airlogix and certain medicaid related assets of summacare  inc approximately million was paid  net of cash acquired  for airlogix 
of the total purchase price of approximately million paid to summacare  million was paid in cash and the remaining million was paid through the issuance of our common stock 
during  our investing activities primarily consisted of the acquisition of firstguard 
in  the largest component of investing activities related to increases in our investment portfolio as a result of our stock offering 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our investment guidelines 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases  sales and maturities 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities with an average duration of years 
cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  corporate bonds  insurance contracts  commercial paper and instruments of the us treasury 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 
we spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  on capital assets consisting primarily of new software  software and hardware upgrades  and furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements related to office and market expansions 
we anticipate spending million on additional capital expenditures in primarily related to market expansions and system upgrades  and approximately million for the acquisition of additional property related to our redevelopment agreement discussed below 
effective december   we executed an agreement with the city of clayton  missouri  a suburb of st 
louis  for the redevelopment of certain properties surrounding our corporate offices 
our primary purpose for the agreement is to accommodate office expansion needs for future company growth 
the total scope of the project includes building two new office towers and street level retail space 
we plan to occupy a portion of those towers 
the total expected cost of the project is approximately million 
it is not our intent to serve as developer of the project  we expect a commercial real estate developer to fund the majority of the project cost 
during  we acquired million of property under capital leases 
this property consists primarily of the land and building related to our new claims processing facility in montana 
during  we purchased the property adjacent to our corporate headquarters in st 
louis  missouri for an aggregate purchase price of million 
this property is being used for the expansion of our corporate offices 
we financed a portion of the purchase price through a million non recourse mortgage loan arrangement 
in july  we purchased the building in which our corporate headquarters is located for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we financed a portion of the purchase price through an million non recourse mortgage loan arrangement 
the mortgage agreements bear interest at the prevailing prime rate less 
at december   our mortgages bore interest at 
our financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in during and  our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our 
table of contents credit facility 
these borrowings were used primarily for our investing activities in conjunction with the acquisition of new business 
during  our financing cash flows primarily consisted of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our public offering completed in august at december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of million as compared to million at december  our working capital is sometimes negative due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and  therefore  are classified as long term 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity and preserve capital 
we manage our short term and long term investments to ensure that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term capital requirements as needed 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  long term investments were million at december  and million at december   including restricted deposits of million and million  respectively 
at december   cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled million 
on september   we executed an amendment to our revolving credit agreement dated september   with several lending institutions  for which lasalle bank national association serves as administrative agent and co lead arranger 
the amendment increased the total amount available under the credit agreement to million from million  including a sub facility for letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million 
in addition  the lending institutions released our prior grant of a security interest in the outstanding common stock and membership interests of each of our subsidiaries 
the credit agreement is now an unsecured facility 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates  the federal funds rate or the prime rate 
under our current capital structure  borrowings under the agreement bear interest at libor plus 
this rate may change under differing capital structures over the life of the agreement 
the agreement contains non financial and financial covenants  including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum tangible net worth 
the agreement will expire on september  or on an earlier date in the instance of a default as defined in the agreement

as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we have filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  covering the issuance of up to million of securities including common stock and debt securities 
no securities have been issued under the shelf registration 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering 
based on our operating plan  we expect that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments  cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures for at least months from the date of this filing 

table of contents our principal contractual obligations at december  consisted of medical claims liabilities  debt  operating leases and purchase obligations 
our debt consists of borrowings from our credit facility  mortgages and capital leases 
the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts in addition to agreements pertaining to the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
the contractual obligations over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years medical claims liabilities debt operating leases purchase obligations total regulatory capital and dividend restrictions as managed care organizations  certain of our subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of million 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk based capital requirements for insurance companies  managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
as of december   our georgia  indiana  new jersey  ohio  texas and wisconsin health plans were in compliance with risk based capital requirements enacted in these states 
if adopted by kansas or missouri  risk based capital requirements may increase the minimum capital required for these subsidiaries 
we continue to monitor the requirements in kansas and missouri and do not expect that they will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
acquisitions in new states or new markets in existing states may require additional capital funding for our regulated subsidiaries 
recent accounting pronouncements in december fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we will adopt sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method  and expect the effect to decrease diluted earnings per share by approximately 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our accounting policies regarding medical claims liabilities and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
medical claims liabilities our medical claims liabilities include claims reported but not yet paid inventory  estimates for claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice 
these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
these estimates are continually reviewed each period and adjustments based on actual claim submissions and additional facts and circumstances are reflected in the period known 
our management uses its judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates 
in developing our estimate for ibnr  we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated 
for more recent periods  incurred non inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors 
incurred hospital claims are estimated based on authorized days and historical per diem claim experience adjusted for known factors 
for older periods  we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates 
the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs 
these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 
the completion factor  claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factors a cost trend factors b decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities in thousands in thousands a reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused by changes in completion factors 
b reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liabilities caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
for example  a increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liabilities would have affected net earnings by million for the year ended december  the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 

table of contents the change in medical claims liabilities is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balance  december claims inventory  december days in claims payable a a days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liabilities at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 
days in claims payable decreased in due to the settlement of a lawsuit with aurora health care  inc  information systems improvements to reduce our claims processing cycle time and the effect of our behavioral health contract in arizona 
acquisitions in the last quarter of contributed to an increase in our days in claims payable calculation 
acquisitions in include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of firstguard 
acquisitions in include reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of uhp 
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider 
as a result  these liabilities generally are described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical claims liabilities as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year 
management expects that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liabilities as of december  will be known by the end of actuarial standards of practice generally require that medical claims liabilities estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions 
moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate 
in many situations  the claims amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years were attributable to favorable development  including changes in medical utilization and cost trends 
these changes in medical utilization and cost trends can be attributable to our margin protection programs and changes in our member demographics 
for all of our membership  we routinely implement new or modified policies that we refer to as our margin protection programs that assist with the control of medical utilization and cost trends such as emergency room policies 
while we try to predict the savings from these programs  actual savings have proven to be better than anticipated  which has contributed to the favorable development of our medical claims liabilities 
intangible assets we have made several acquisitions since that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets 
these intangible assets primarily consist of purchased contract rights  provider contracts  non compete agreements and 
table of contents goodwill 
at december  we have million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
purchased contract rights are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
provider contracts are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over years  the period of the agreement 
our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be permanently impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective acquired entity 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  future utility and other internal and external factors  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment 
in addition  we will perform an impairment analysis of other intangible assets based on other factors 
these factors would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
we did not recognize any impairment losses during the three years ended december  
table of contents forward looking statements this filing contains forward looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
we have attempted to identify these statements by terminology including believe  anticipate  plan  expect  estimate  intend  seek  goal  may  will  should  can  continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements include statements about our market opportunity  our growth strategy  competition  expected activities and future acquisitions  investments and the adequacy of our available cash resources 
these statements may be found in item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
readers are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including economic  regulatory  competitive and other factors that may cause our or our industry s actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
actual results may differ from projections or estimates due to a variety of important factors  including the factors set forth in item a 
risk factors 
our results of operations and projections of future earnings depend in large part on accurately predicting and effectively managing health benefits and other operating expenses 
a variety of factors  including competition  changes in healthcare practices  changes in federal or state laws and regulations or their interpretations  inflation  provider contract changes  new technologies  government imposed surcharges  taxes or assessments  reduction in provider payments by governmental payers  major epidemics  disasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of healthcare  such as major healthcare providers inability to maintain their operations  may in the future affect our ability to control our medical costs and other operating expenses 
governmental action or business conditions could result in premium revenues not increasing to offset any increase in medical costs and other operating expenses 
once set  premiums are generally fixed for one year periods and  accordingly  unanticipated costs during such periods cannot be recovered through higher premiums 
the expiration  cancellation or suspension of our medicaid managed care contracts by the state governments would also negatively affect us 
due to these factors and risks  we cannot give assurances with respect to our future premium levels or our ability to control our future medical costs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million  including restricted deposits of million 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
the long term investments consist of municipal  corporate and us agency bonds  life insurance contracts and us treasury investments and have maturities greater than one year 
restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies 
due to the nature of the states requirements  these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
inflation although the general rate of inflation has remained relatively stable and healthcare cost inflation has stabilized in recent years  the national healthcare cost inflation rate still exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our margin protection program and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases 
compliance costs federal and state regulations governing standards for electronic transactions  data security and confidentiality of patient information have been issued in recent years 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the regulatory requirements  we cannot be sure that the systems and programs that we have implemented will comply adequately with the regulations that are ultimately adopted 
implementation of additional systems and programs may be required 
further  compliance with these regulations would require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover our costs of complying with these new regulations from the states
