in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate  potential  or continue  the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from any forward looking statement as a result of various factors  including those described above in item a under risk factors 
we begin md a with a discussion of sirenza s overall strategy to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the directions in which our business and products are moving  followed by an overview of the critical factors that affect our net revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe require the most significant judgments to be made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in the next section we discuss the results of our operations for compared to and for compared to we then provide an analysis of our cash flows  including the impact on cash of important balance sheet changes  and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled liquidity and capital resources and contractual obligations 
company overview we are a supplier of rf components for the commercial communications  consumer and a d equipment markets 
our products are designed to optimize the reception and transmission of voice and data signals in mobile wireless communications networks and in other wireless and wireline applications 
our commercial communications applications include components for mobile wireless infrastructure applications  wireless lans  fixed wireless networks  broadband wireline applications such as coaxial cable and fiber optic networks  cable television set top boxes  rfid readers  wireless video transmitters  as well as tuner ics and receivers and tuners for hdtv set top boxes 
our consumer applications include antennas and receivers for satellite radio 
sales of components for the a d end markets include components for government  military  avionics  space and homeland security systems 
we believe a fundamental value we provide to our customers is derived from our focus on the needs of customer specific applications  our wide array of highly engineered products in multiple technologies  and our commitment to provide our customers with worldwide sales and application engineering support 
we offer a broad line of products that range in complexity from discrete components to ics and mcms 
our discrete  ic and mcm products employ numerous semiconductor process technologies  which we believe allows us to optimize our products for our customers applications 
our annual net revenues have increased in each of  and  driven by new product introductions  increased market share and the addition of complementary products through our strategic acquisitions of other companies and assets 
in the past three years we have completed two acquisitions and have a third acquisition pending as of the date of this annual report on form k 
on february   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire premier devices  inc  or pdi  by merger for consideration consisting of million shares of our common stock  million in cash and million in term notes that will mature year following the closing of the transaction 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of pdi designs  manufactures and markets complementary rf components featuring technologies common to existing and planned sirenza products  and is headquartered in san jose  california with significant manufacturing operations in both shanghai  china and nuremberg  germany 
this acquisition is intended to expand both the depth and breadth of our products  extend our design and manufacturing capabilities into asia and europe and advance our strategic mission to diversify and expand our end markets and applications 
for a description of related risks  see our disclosure in item a under risk factors 
on december   we acquired isg  a designer of rf gateway module and ic products for the cable tv  satellite radio and hdtv markets 
this acquisition enables us to address new end markets  including hdtv and satellite radio  and broadens our product offering in the set top box market by adding isg s silicon based receiver tuner products to our existing product lines targeting this market 
sales of the products acquired in the isg acquisition represented a significant amount of our net revenues in on may   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed specified liabilities of vari l company  inc  a designer and manufacturer of voltage controlled oscillators vcos  phase locked loop plls and other mcm products for the mobile wireless infrastructure market  as well as certain components for the a d market 
this acquisition strengthened our product portfolio by adding rf signal source components while strengthening our presence in the a d markets 
the acquisition of vari l added a significant amount of net revenues to sirenza subsequent to the date of the transaction 
after the acquisition of vari l  we relocated our corporate headquarters and consolidated our manufacturing facilities in broomfield  colorado  which allowed us to achieve significant operational cost synergies  primarily in operations  general and administrative and  to a more limited degree  in sales and marketing 
historically we have utilized a divisional organization structure focused on either specific end markets and or product types 
beginning in january of  we expanded our reporting structure by adding the a d division to the amplifier and signal source divisions 
the amplifier and signal source divisions are product focused while the a d division is market focused 
the amplifier and signal source divisions are generally focused on similar end markets and customers and are managed separately in order to better manage the research and development and marketing efforts for particular products 
the a d division is focused on the government  military  avionics  space and homeland security systems end markets 
the amplifier division s main product lines are primarily ic based and include discrete  amplifier  low noise amplifier  power amplifier and transceiver ic products  an mcm product line including power amplifier modules and our broadband product line  which includes our satellite radio antenna 
the signal source division s main product lines are mcms used in mobile wireless infrastructure applications to generate and control rf signals  including vcos  plls  coaxial resonator oscillators cros  passive and active mixers  an ic based modulator and demodulator product line and a line of signal couplers 
the a d division s main product lines are government and military specified versions of certain of our amplifier and signal processing components and various passive components 
for a further description of our divisional organizational structure  see our disclosure under note segments of an enterprise and related information in our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth below 
in we have moved from the three segment reporting structure described above to a structure consisting of one rf component sales segment made up of five market focused strategic business units aerospace  defense and homeland security  broadband and consumer  mobile wireless  standard products and wireless access 
while we will provide limited data at the strategic business unit level in our future reports  these business units will not have separate profit and loss statements reviewed by our chief operating decision maker  and accordingly will be reported as a single segment 
following the closing of our pending acquisition of pdi  we currently expect that pdi will also be reported as a separate segment 
revenue overview revenue recognition we present our revenue results as net revenues 
net revenues are defined as our revenues less sales discounts  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments 
historically  these revenue related adjustments have not typically represented a significant percentage of our revenues 
we sell our products worldwide through a direct sales channel and a distribution sales channel 
distributor sales our distribution arrangements provide our distributors with limited rights of return and certain price adjustments on unsold inventory held by them 
we recognize revenues on sales to our distributors under such arrangements at the time our products are sold by the distributors to third party customers 
our distribution channel  which accounted for of total net revenues for  consists of those sales made by our distribution channel partners avnet  acal  rfmw  nu horizons and digi key under arrangements featuring such rights of return and price adjustment terms 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated our distribution relationship with nu horizons and entered into a worldwide distribution agreement with digi key corporation 

table of contents direct and reseller sales sales to avnet and acal as resellers  and to other resellers of our products  are made pursuant to arrangements that do not include the limited rights of return and price adjustment terms applicable to our distribution sales 
we generally recognize revenue from these sales to these resellers of our products  and from sales to all other non distribution customers  at the time product has shipped  title has transferred and no obligations remain 
our direct sales channel  which accounted for of total net revenues for  consists of those sales made to all non distributor customers and sales to resellers of our products  including sales to avnet and acal as resellers 
although we have typically not experienced a delay in customer acceptance of our products  should a customer delay acceptance in the future  our policy is to delay revenue recognition until a customer accepts the products 
customer concentrations historically  a significant percentage of our net revenues have been derived from a limited number of customers  including our distributors 
over time  both as a result of our active sales and marketing efforts and industry wide changes in customer buying patterns  our customer base shifted significantly toward direct sales to large wireless infrastructure original equipment manufacturers oems and their contract manufacturers cms 
one driver of this shift is that our oem customers have increased their outsourcing of the manufacture of their equipment to cms  including celestica  flextronics  sanmina and solectron 
as a result  we sell directly to both oems and cms 
our oem customers currently make the sourcing decisions for our sales to cms 
when we report customer net revenues in our public announcements  we typically attribute all net revenues to the ultimate oem customer and not the respective cm or subcontractor 
this sales trend toward large wireless infrastructure oems and their cms was strengthened in by the acquisition of vari l  whose customers were also large infrastructure oems  including nokia  siemens and motorola 
the addition of these customers complemented sirenza s existing relationships with large oem customers such as andrew  ericsson  lucent and their cms 
in we added to this customer concentration as a significant portion of our net revenues were derived from sales of our satellite radio antenna product to kiryung electronics co  inc  and other subcontractors of sirius satellite radio 
we believe that net revenues attributable to our global oems and their cms will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in  and that net revenues attributable to our satellite radio customer and its subcontractors will also account for a significant portion of our net revenues in that same period 
diversification and expansion strategy we have grown our net revenues through the introduction of new products  increasing our market share and adding complementary products through strategic acquisitions in existing end markets and new end markets 
we continue to focus on diversification efforts in order to capitalize on new opportunities in end markets outside of the wireless infrastructure market such as cable tv  wimax  satellite radio  hdtv  rfid and other broadband applications 
we believe that sales of our products in markets outside of wireless infrastructure  including the satellite radio market  will continue to account for a substantial portion of net revenues in we are also focusing on expansion in  as evidenced by our pending acquisition of pdi  which is intended to expand both the depth and breadth of our product lines  and to extend our design and manufacturing capabilities into asia and europe 
we expect that the addition to our product portfolio of pdi s complementary rf components will accelerate our penetration into the cable tv infrastructure market and allow us to offer more complete rf solutions to our customers and pdi s  and hope that these increased capabilities will allow us to capitalize on a trend we have seen at large oem and cm customers for some time toward purchasing a broader range of products from fewer qualified suppliers 
geographic concentrations sales into asia increased in each of the last three years as a result of oems increasingly outsourcing their manufacturing to cms  primarily in china 
in addition  we have increased our focus and presence in china and are experiencing increased shipments to various chinese oem customers 
based on these factors and our pending acquisition of pdi  which has manufacturing and sales operations in shanghai  china  we anticipate that a large percentage of our direct sales will be in the asia region in competitors with respect to products sold in our amplifier division  we compete primarily with other suppliers of high performance rf components used in the infrastructure of communications networks  such as agilent  hittite  m a com  nec and wj communications 
for our newer broadband products  we expect our most significant competitors will include maxim integrated products  microtune  motorola  stmicroelectronics and philips 
with respect to our signal source division products  our primary competitors are alps  m a com and minicircuits 
with respect to our a d division products  our primary competitors are hittite  m a com  spectrum control and teledyne 
with respect to our satellite antenna sales  we compete with other manufacturers of satellite antennas and related equipment  including m a com  receptec and wistron neweb 
we also compete with communications equipment manufacturers  some of whom are our customers that design rf components internally  such as ericsson  lucent  motorola  nokia and nortel networks 
cost of revenues overview cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with wafers from third party wafer fabs for our ic products  raw material components from third party vendors  for our ic  mcm and satellite antenna products  packaging for our ic products performed by third party vendors  assembling and testing of our mcm products in our facility  testing of our ic products in our facility and by third party vendors  assembling and testing of our satellite antenna products performed by a third party vendor  and costs associated with procurement  production control  quality assurance  reliability and manufacturing engineering 

table of contents for our ic products  we outsource our wafer manufacturing and packaging and then perform most of our final testing and tape and reel assembly at our colorado manufacturing facility 
for our mcms  we manufacture  assemble and test most of our products at our manufacturing facility in colorado 
for our satellite antenna products  we outsource our assembly and testing to a third party vendor 
historically  we have relied upon a limited number of foundries to manufacture most of our semiconductor wafers for our ic products 
we have contractual agreements with most  but not all  of these suppliers in which pricing is established based on volume  and in which price  volume and other terms are reset on a periodic basis through negotiations between the parties based on current market conditions 
we source our ic packaging assembly from a limited number of established  international commercial vendors 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on a limited number of vendors for our wafer and packaging requirements 
generally  raw materials utilized by us for our mcm and satellite antenna products are readily available from numerous sources 
these vendors are competitive and we expect that to the extent our volumes increase  we may be able to reduce costs by obtaining better volume pricing and delivery terms 
we currently outsource a portion of our manufacturing and testing function  and may increasingly do so where economically attractive 
gross profit and margin overview our gross profit and gross margin percent can be influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to product features historically  customers have been willing to pay a premium for new or different features or functionality 
therefore  increased sales of such products in a given period are likely to have a positive effect on our gross margin percent 
product type in the markets in which we operate  ic products have historically yielded a higher gross margin percent than mcms and our satellite antenna products 
therefore  increased sales of ic products in a given period are likely to have a positive effect on our gross margin percent 
conversely  increased sales of mcms  and in particular satellite antenna products  in a given period are likely to have a negative effect on our gross margin percent 
market our products are sold into a wide variety of markets and each of these markets has a pricing structure that is dictated by the economics of that particular market 
therefore  the gross margin percent on our products can vary by the markets into which they are sold 
increased sales into higher margin markets in a given period will have a positive effect on our gross margin percent  and increased sales into lower margin markets in a given period will generally have the opposite effect 
this is particularly evident for our satellite antenna product  which is sold into the consumer products  or retail  market where gross margin percentages are generally lower than those in industrial markets 
sales channel historically  the gross margin percent on sales to our large oem customers has been lower than the gross margin percent on sales through our distribution channel or sales to some of our smaller direct customers 
this is primarily due to the bargaining power attendant to large oem customers based on their higher product volumes 
therefore  increased sales to our large oem customers in a given period may have a negative effect on our gross margin percent 
level of integration of the product we have seen a trend among our customers toward generally seeking more integrated products with enhanced functionality  which enables them to procure fewer products from fewer suppliers 
these integrated products typically command a higher average selling price than our stand alone components 
however  the manufacturing costs of these integrated products are higher  which generally results in a lower gross margin percent on sales of our integrated products in comparison to our stand alone components 
therefore  increased sales of our more integrated products in a given period will generally have a positive impact on our average selling prices and a negative effect on our gross margin percent 
the efficiency and effectiveness of our manufacturing operations our gross margin percent is generally lower in periods with less volume and higher in periods with increased volume 
in periods in which volumes produced internally are low  our fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to fewer units  thereby negatively impacting our gross margin percent when those products are sold 
conversely  in periods in which volumes produced internally are high  our fixed manufacturing overhead costs are allocated to more units  thereby positively impacting gross margin percent when those products are sold 
provision for excess inventories as discussed in more detail in critical accounting policies and estimates  our cost of revenues and gross margin percent may be negatively influenced by provisions for excess inventories and positively influenced by the sale of previously written down inventory 
these actions can have material impacts on cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percent 
we believe that each of the above factors will continue to affect our cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percentage for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the interaction of the factors listed above could have a significant period to period effect on our cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin percent 
operating expense overview research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and salary related expenses for personnel engaged in r d activities  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and  to a lesser extent  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers 
we expense all of our r d costs as they are incurred 
our r d costs can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing and quantities of materials bought for prototype and test units 
we believe one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to offer a broad range of highly engineered products designed to meet the needs of our customers 
our strategy is to continue to invest in r d at levels appropriate for our overall operating plan in order to maintain our competitive advantage 
from time to time we will receive funding from our customers for non recurring engineering nre expenses to help defray the cost of work performed at their request 
we record nre funding as a reduction to research and development expenses in the period that the customer agrees that the objective s established for payment of the nre have been achieved 
we historically have performed our r d activities in multiple  geographically dispersed locations in north america 
we believe maintaining multiple r d design centers allows us to attract key personnel we might not otherwise be able to hire 
in addition  we believe that having stand alone r d centers allows the personnel there to better concentrate on their development tasks 
we plan to continue our strategy of conducting our r d activities in multiple locations 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and salary related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and application engineering functions  as well as costs associated with trade shows  promotional activities  advertising and public relations 
we record as an expense commissions to our external  independent sales representatives when revenues from the associated sale are recognized 
we record as an expense quarterly cash incentives to internal sales employees based on the achievement of targeted net revenue and sales related goals 

table of contents we intend to invest in increasing the number of direct sales personnel and application engineers supporting our customers at levels appropriate for our overall operating plan 
in particular  to support our customers  we have placed both sales personnel and application engineers in various time zones around the world 
we believe that our direct sales force and application engineers provide us with a key competitive advantage in our markets 
we intend to maintain our investment in sales and marketing functions in order to sustain our advantage in this area 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and salary related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  and human resources personnel  as well as insurance and professional fees 
we intend to invest in general and administrative expenses at levels appropriate for our overall operating plan 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  in particular the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors  and the valuation of long lived assets including acquisition related intangible assets 
however  we do not believe these policies currently meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
non marketable equity securities in  we acquired million shares of gcs  a privately held semiconductor foundry 
the acquired shares represented of the shares outstanding at the time 
the investment strengthened our supply chain for ingap semiconductor technologies 
in connection with the investment  our president and ceo joined the seven member gcs board of directors 
we regularly evaluate our investment in gcs to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
factors that may cause an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in gcs would include  but not be limited to  a degradation of the general business environment in which gcs operates  the failure of gcs to achieve certain performance milestones  a series of operating losses in excess of gcs business plan  the inability of gcs to continue as a going concern or a reduced valuation as determined by a new financing event 
evaluating each of these factors involves a significant amount of judgment on management s part 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline in value has occurred  we will write down our investment in gcs to fair value 
such a write down could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
for example  in the fourth quarters of and  we wrote down the value of our investment in gcs by million and million  respectively  after determining that gcs value had experienced an other than temporary decline 
the ultimate realization of our investment in gcs will be dependent on the occurrence of a liquidity event for gcs  and or our ability to sell our gcs shares  for which there is no public market 
the likelihood of any of these events occurring will depend on  among other things  the market conditions surrounding the wireless communications industry and the related semiconductor foundry industry  as well as the public markets receptivity to liquidity events such as initial public offerings or merger and acquisition activities 
valuation of goodwill goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual review in the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to that reporting unit 
our fair value methodology consists of a forecasted discounted cash flow model and a market value model 
the forecasted discounted cash flow model uses estimates of revenue for the business unit  based on estimates of market segment growth rates  estimated costs  and an estimated appropriate discount rate 
these estimates are based on historical data  various internal estimates  various external market sources of information  and management s expectations of future trends 
our market value model considers our market capitalization and market multiples of revenue for comparable companies in our industry  as determined by management 
this information is derived from publicly available sources 
all of these estimates  including the selection of comparable publicly traded companies  involve a significant amount of judgment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
our expectations are that the most important factor in our estimation will be our ability to accurately forecast the demand for our products 
we conducted our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the third quarter of the estimates that we used assumed that the reporting units would participate in a gradually improving market for radio frequency components in the commercial communications and a d equipment markets  that our share of those markets would increase  and the profitability of the reporting units would increase over time 
we concluded that we did not have any impairment of goodwill based on our forecasted discounted cash flows  our market capitalization and market multiples of revenue of comparable companies in our industry 
excess and obsolete inventories our provision for excess inventories is based on levels of inventory exceeding the forecasted demand of such products within specific time horizons 
we forecast demand for specific products based on the number of products we expect to sell  with such assumptions dependent on our assessment of market conditions and current and expected orders from our customers  considering that orders are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment 
if forecasted demand decreases or if inventory levels increase disproportionately to forecasted demand  inventory write downs may be required 
likewise  if we ultimately sell inventories that were previously written down  we would reduce the previously recorded excess inventory provisions which would have a positive impact on our cost of revenues  gross margin percent and operating results 
we recorded a provision for excess inventories of million in we subsequently began selling some of these written down inventory products 
in  we sold previously written down inventory products with an original cost basis of approximately  as the cost basis for written down inventories is less than the original cost basis when such products are sold  cost of revenues associated with the sale will be lower  which results in a higher gross margin on that sale 
sales of previously written down inventories had a positive impact on our gross margin in of less than one percentage point 

table of contents the following table illustrates the impact on cost of revenues of additions to written down inventories and sales of previously written down inventory products for historical sirenza amplifier division products and also provides a schedule of the activity of sirenza s written down inventories in thousands year ended december  additions to written down inventories charged to cost of revenues sales of written down inventories with no associated cost of revenues disposition of written down inventories via scrap and other written down inventories at end of period the single largest factor affecting the accuracy of our provisions for excess inventories will be the accuracy of our end customers forecasts 
affecting these forecasts will be demand for rf communications components in our market segments 
also impacting it will be the speed at which our products are designed in or out of our customers products 
we will ultimately dispose of written down inventories by either selling such products or scrapping them 
we currently expect sales of written down inventory products in to be approximately equivalent to or lower than in similarly  we anticipate that we will scrap additional written down inventories in the near term 
deferred tax assets we perform quarterly and annual assessments of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
as a result of these assessments  we previously concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance established in was recorded as a result of our analysis of the facts and circumstances at that time  which led us to conclude that we could no longer forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
we continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance 
to the extent we continue to generate taxable income in and if our projections indicate that we are likely to generate sufficient future taxable income  we may determine that some  or all  of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
in the quarter in which the valuation allowance is reduced  we would recognize a benefit from income taxes on our income statement

net revenues from sales to avnet and acal under distribution arrangements in which rights of return and price adjustment programs are applicable are included in net revenues attributable to our distribution channel 

table of contents net revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to a substantial increase in shipments of our broadband and satellite antenna products  which we obtained as part of our acquisition of isg in december partially offsetting this increase was a decline in market share at some of our large oem customers  as well as a reduction in average selling prices to our wireless infrastructure oem customers in compared to as a result of our oems negotiating lower prices for and transitioning to lower priced sige products from higher priced gaas products 
the reduction in average selling prices primarily impacted our amplifier and signal source divisions 
sales into asia increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in compared to primarily as a result of our oems increasingly outsourcing their manufacturing to contract manufacturers  primarily in china 
also contributing to the percentage increase in sales to asia was an increase in sales to chinese oem customers as a result of our continued focus in the asia region and an increase in shipments to asian cms of our broadband and satellite antenna products  which we obtained as part of our acquisition of isg in december sales into europe decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in compared to as a result of the continued outsourcing of our oem customers to their contract manufacturers 
the decrease in distribution net revenues on a percentage basis in compared to was primarily attributable to our addition in of significant revenues from direct sales of our broadband and satellite radio antenna products 
net revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily the result of a full year of sales of the products obtained in the acquisition of vari l  which closed on may  net revenues attributable to our signal source and a d divisions  which consist primarily of products acquired in the vari l acquisition  totaled million in compared to million in the increased signal source product sales also were primary contributors to the net revenue increases in asia and through our direct sales channel 
although sales to europe decreased as a percentage of net revenues in compared to  net revenues increased in absolute dollars  largely as a result of the increase in signal source product sales 
in addition to the increase in sales attributable to our signal source and a d products  sales of our amplifier division products increased to million in from million in these increases in sales were attributable to a strengthening of customers end markets  increased market share and penetration of new market segments 
the decrease in distribution net revenues in compared to was primarily attributable to our increased focus on large oem customers  many of whom prefer to have direct relationships with their suppliers  including us 
in addition  in  we began promoting the sales of our products to asia through one of our resellers instead of through our distribution partners 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of a higher proportion of our net revenues being attributable to our broadband and satellite antenna products  which typically carry a higher cost of sales percentage than our wireless infrastructure products 
partially offsetting this increase were lower costs attributable to volume related factory efficiencies and the automation of certain of our testing operations in late and the transition to sige products  which in addition to having lower average selling prices  also have lower costs 
in addition  in  we sold previously written down inventory products of approximately  compared to  in operations personnel decreased to at december  from at december   partially driven by our manufacturing facility automation efforts 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of additional costs associated with increased sales of our signal source and a d products following our acquisition of vari l 
cost of revenues attributable to our signal source and a d products totaled million in compared to million in cost of sales within the amplifier division increased primarily as a result of power amplifier module products  which grew to million in compared to  in in addition  in  we sold previously written down inventory products of approximately  compared to million in gross profit and gross margin gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit and gross margin were primarily attributable to the mix of products sold in compared to  as described above 
the gross margin on sales of our broadband and satellite antenna products are typically lower than the gross margin on sales of our amplifier ic based products and our signal source and a d division products  and sales of our broadband and satellite antenna products represented more than of our total net revenues in while representing only an insignificant amount of our net revenues in other contributory factors to the decrease in gross margin in compared to were lower average selling prices  primarily on sales to our wireless infrastructure oem customers  which is a trend that may continue in additionally  in  we experienced lower sales of previously written down inventories compared to sales of previously written down inventories resulted in less than a one percentage point improvement in our gross margin in compared to approximately a one percentage point improvement in our gross margin in gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to additional sales of our signal source and a d products following the acquisition of vari l as discussed above 
in addition  we incurred relocation and related expenses in to move operations personnel and the sunnyvale and tempe manufacturing facilities to broomfield  colorado  which did not occur in gross margin increased to in from in the increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the achievement of operational cost synergies as a result of the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities in broomfield  colorado  subsequent to the vari l transaction  as well as volume related factory efficiencies and the automation of certain of our testing operations 
finally  we had a product mix in that had higher gross margins than in partially offsetting the increase in gross margin were fewer sales of previously written down inventories in compared to sales of previously written down inventories resulted in approximately a one percentage point improvement in our gross margin in compared to approximately a four percentage point improvement in our gross margin in operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to costs of additional personnel engaged in research and development activities subsequent to the acquisition of isg 
a full year of such costs are included in our results  while only a few weeks of such costs are present in our results due to the timing of the acquisition 
salaries and salary related expenses increased by 
table of contents approximately  in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of isg 
other contributory factors included additional costs associated with software maintenance  which added costs of approximately  engineering material purchases  which added costs of approximately  and higher facility costs

additional payments of up to million each may be paid in and as discussed in note contingencies in our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth below  at december  we determined it to be probable that the full earn out of million related to the year ended december  would be paid in accordingly  we accrued for the expected payment of the earn out on our consolidated balance sheet in accrued compensation and other expenses and correspondingly increased goodwill by million 

table of contents in we used cash of approximately million related to our acquisition of vari l 
the capital expenditures of million in referred to above primarily related to additional automation equipment for our broomfield  colorado manufacturing facility and mask set purchases related to the production releases of a number of new products in the capital expenditures of million in were primarily related to capital expenditures factory automation equipment for the plant in broomfield 
we expect that our capital expenditures for will increase from as we continue to invest in manufacturing equipment and production mask sets 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for compared to million in and  in the major financing inflow of cash in all three years was related to proceeds from employee stock plans 
the major financing use of cash in all three years was for principal payments on capital lease obligations 
as of december   we did not have any capital lease obligations 
we expect cash provided by employee stock plans in to be higher than  however  this number can vary widely depending on the price of our stock and the cash needs of our employees 
our pending acquisition of pdi is expected to close in the second quarter of  and we expect to pay million in cash to the pdi shareholders at closing  and also to issue them promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of million  bearing simple interest per annum paid monthly and maturing in one year 
we expect to pay these amounts from our current cash and investments and cash generated from our future operations 
the pdi acquisition will significantly reduce our cash and investments in the quarter in which the transaction closes and the quarter in which the notes are repaid 
based on current macro economic conditions and conditions in the commercial communications  consumer and a d equipment markets  the current company structure and plans for the acquisition of pdi and our current outlook for  we expect that we will be able to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs from the cash generated from operating and financing activities for at least the next months 
other sources of liquidity that may be available to us are the leasing of capital equipment  a line of credit at a commercial bank  or the sale of our securities 
the issuance of any additional shares would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we draw on the other sources of liquidity and capital resources noted above to grow our business  execute our operating plans  or acquire complementary technologies or businesses  it could result in increased expense and lower profitability 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease commitments additional cash consideration related to the acquisition of isg broadband  inc unconditional purchase obligations total total does not include certain purchase obligations as discussed in the three paragraphs immediately below 
purchase commitments are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
we include in purchase commitments contractual obligations we have with our vendors who supply us with our wafer requirements for ic based products 
because the wafers we purchase are unique to these suppliers and involve significant expense  our agreements with these suppliers prohibit cancellation subsequent to the production release of the products in our suppliers manufacturing facilities  regardless of whether our end customers cancel orders with us or our requirements are reduced 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials  other than wafer requirements for ic based products  and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
except for wafers for our ic based products  we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
the total indicated in the table above does not include million in cash and million in promissory notes to be issued to shareholders of pdi pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger related to our proposed acquisition of pdi dated february  it also does not include any earn out payments related to our acquisition of isg that may subsequently become payable in and if contractually earned 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  cash flows from operations and cash flows from financing activities 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is based upon current information 
timing and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods  changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations and the closing of the transaction with pdi 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires employee share based equity awards to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
and allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is then amortized to expense over the service periods 
sfas no 
r allows for either modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or modified retrospective recognition 
in the first quarter of  the company began to apply the modified prospective recognition method and implemented the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options commencing january  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share in future periods 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although of our sales were to non us based customers and distributors in  all sales continue to be denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have not had any material exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect sales into foreign markets to continue at current levels or increase in future periods  particularly in europe and asia 
because sirenza s sales are denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make its products less competitive in foreign markets 
alternatively  if the us dollar were to weaken  it would make our products more competitive in foreign markets  but could result in higher prices from our foreign vendors 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of bank deposits  federal agency and related securities and money market funds issued or managed by large financial institutions in the united states 
we did not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and available for sale investments 
for example  assuming that our cash and available for sale investments balance at december  remains unchanged  a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease sirenza s annual interest income by approximately
