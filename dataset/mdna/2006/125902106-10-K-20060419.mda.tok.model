executive overview the company s operations cpi corp 
is a long standing leader  based on sittings and related revenues  in the professional portrait photography of young children and families 
from the single studio opened by our predecessor company in  we have grown to  studios throughout the united states  canada and puerto rico principally under license agreements with sears 
we have provided professional portrait photography for sears customers since and have been the only sears portrait studio operator since as of the end of the last three fiscal years  the company s studio counts were united states and puerto rico within full line sears stores locations not within sears stores within sears essential grand stores canada total during  the company completed its transition of all its us studios to full digital technology and opened new  all digital portrait studios in sears essential and or sears grand formats  bringing the total of such new studios to competitive factors trends challenges as previously discussed  the mass market professional portrait studio industry is facing challenging and difficult industry conditions 
these include relatively slow category growth  industry sitting declines  heavy promotional activity  the heightened efforts of relatively new category competitors and the rapid evolution of both amateur and professional digital technology 
the competitive and other external factors cited above  coupled with customer service issues over the past several years due to technology and support challenges caused in part by an aging studio infrastructure and certain other operational issues  resulted in a declining sittings trend in our sears portrait studios 
the move to a digital format has significantly eliminated the impact of the aging studio infrastructure within the us  but aggressive competitor pricing as well as our own offer strategies continues to put pressure on the level of sittings 
our sittings volumes declined by nearly from to although a portion of the sittings decline has been offset by increases in our average customer sales  overall net sales over the same time period have declined from million in to million in  reaching a low level of million in before recovery to the aforementioned million in on march   the knightspoint group successfully completed their consent solicitation resulting in  among other things  a change of control of the company s then existing directors 
shortly thereafter  the company s new board conducted a comprehensive review of the company s operations and competitive position and formulated a range of new operating initiatives for the company 
as a result of that review  the company has taken the following actions  among others  in  in an effort to improve operations  increase customer satisfaction and retention and reverse the declining trend in sales exited the mexican and mobile photography businesses that were draining scarce managerial and financial resources from the core sears portrait studio business 
terminated a major internal software development project intended to be the foundation for the company s ultimate transition to a digital format and instead pursued outsourcing options with third party vendors 
upgraded computer hardware in all us studios  improving the performance of legacy dos based systems while preparing the way for a transition to digital 
restored coverage  training and retention hours in the studios that had been reduced in in response to declining sales 
raised prices and tapped more efficient advertising vehicles 
introduced several new products that contributed approximately million in busy season sales 
converted of our us studios to full digital format prior to the busy season 
during  the following actions were taken to further the objectives referred to above successfully converted all of the remaining us studios to full digital format 
leveraged our recently installed digital technology to provide customers greater variety in posing and effects  speedier including same day fulfillment of portrait orders  a range of new product and service options  and an improved overall experience 
implemented on going extensive changes in our marketing program designed to transition to everyday value  reduce dependence on coupons and promotional activity and prepare the way for a repositioning of the sears portrait studio brand in conjunction with the completion of the digital rollout 
at the same time  we have broadly tested various offer changes  including higher prices  designed to reflect the differentiated value proposition offered in our digital studios 
implemented various field initiatives to drive improvement in quality  customer service  productivity and customer retention 
the foregoing initiatives have shown tangible benefits 
late in the third quarter of  we experienced a partial reversal in the negative sales performance we reported in the first half of the year  and for fiscal we reported a increase in sales from  the first such increase since and more importantly  income from operations increased to million in as compared to a loss of million in results of operations a summary of consolidated results of operations and key statistics follows thousands  except share and per share data net sales cost and expenses cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below cost of sales as a percentage of net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales depreciation and amortization other charges and impairments income loss from continuing operations interest expense interest income impairment and related obligations of preferred security interest loss from debt extinguishment other income  net earnings loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net earnings loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit of  in and  in net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted net sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net sales for increased million  or  to million from the million reported in the overall increase in sales is due to a increase in average sales per customer sitting  partially offset by a year over year decline in sittings 
the company believes its increase in average sale per customer sitting in is principally attributable to its customers positive response to the differentiated value proposition created in the new digital studio environment 
this has resulted in an expanded assortment and related increased sales of higher value  new and specialty products and services  as well as additional on site printing and digital enhancement fees 
the company attributes the sittings decline to several internal and external factors 
the company s marketing program has undergone extensive changes designed to transition to everyday value  reduce dependence on coupons and promotional activity and prepare the way for a significant repositioning of the sears portrait studio brand in conjunction with the completion of the digital rollout 
at the same time  the company has broadly tested various offer changes  including higher prices  designed to reflect the differentiated value proposition offered in its digital studios 
while positively impacting average transaction size  these offer changes have resulted in the loss of more price sensitive customers to lower priced competitors 
the company also believes the continuing proliferation of amateur digital photography may be reducing portrait activity  especially during periods such as the company s third quarter  which are marked by the absence of significant holidays 
finally  sittings were also negatively impacted by the severe hurricane season that principally affected studios in alabama  florida  louisiana  mississippi and texas 
net sales in declined million  or  to million compared to the million reported in this decline in sales is attributable to a continued decline in customer sittings and the absence of the additional week of sales that was reported in  a week fiscal year  both partially offset by an increase in the average sales per customer sitting 
average sales per customer sitting in increased approximately while customer sittings declined  both compared to the fiscal year 
the company experienced a nearly sales decline during the first half of based on both sittings and average sale declines 
through the first half of  the average sale per customer sitting was down compared to the first half of due largely to increased discounting of offers in response to competitive pressures 
the negative first half average sales trend was totally reversed in the third quarter of when for that quarter the company reported average sales per customer sitting increased compared to the comparable quarter in as a result  the company s negative sales trend moderated to just over a decline 
during the fourth quarter of  the company benefited from an approximate increase in its average sale per customer sitting 
the company believes the reversal in the negative sales trends experienced from late into is largely attributable to the impact of the initiatives undertaken in under the direction of the new board of directors as outlined in the executive overview under competitive factors trends challenges 
costs and expenses were million in  compared with million in and million in cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in and in correspondingly  gross margin rates were in  in and in the decrease in cost of sales from to  despite higher sales  resulted primarily from lower overall production levels due to the decline in sittings and savings on film and shipping costs that resulted directly from the digital conversion 
in addition  the company incurred lower workers compensation costs as a result of more favorable loss experience for the year 
these decreases were partially offset by increased costs associated with the production and shipping of new and specialty products not previously available in the analog film environment and increased third party production costs related to outsourced greeting card production in the decrease in cost of sales from to is primarily the result of reduced levels of sittings and productivity improvements generated from improved manufacturing processes surrounding the second year of production of digitally enhanced products 
the decreases were partially offset by markdowns on merchandise sales of frames and accessories in an effort to clear older inventory  higher effective media costs associated both with new digital studios as well as inefficiencies related to start up operations of new digital printers in the analog studios and the reversal in the third quarter of of a previously accrued liability 
this reversal related to the favorable renegotiation of the company s supply contract with a vendor amounting to approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  these expenses were in  in and in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally the result of increases in studio employment costs million  sales commissions paid to sears resulting from increased sales million  incentive compensation accruals  and increased amortization expenses related to periodic vesting of previously granted restricted stock awards 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in advertising costs  employee medical insurance costs million  professional service costs  lower corporate and non studio employment costs million  lower supplemental executive retirement costs  and net decreases in various other expense categories resulting from the company s ongoing cost containment efforts 
studio employment increased due to the restoration of labor hour reductions that were initiated the first half of  an increased number of hours invested during the christmas selling season and an increase in the average hourly wage rate 
as a result of the digital conversion  on site printing capabilities were expanded and central fulfillment lead times were reduced resulting in an extended holiday selling season requiring the commitment of additional labor hours 
these increases to studio employment were partially offset by the positive impact of initiatives launched in the first half of to improve labor scheduling and productivity 
advertising costs declined principally as a result of the elimination of broadcast media and related production costs in the current year 
in addition  a more targeted focus in terms of type and frequency of media utilized resulted in reduced spending 
medical costs have decreased as a result of lower claim volumes and an absence of high individual claims during the year 
professional service costs have declined primarily due to the completion or elimination of projects underway in lower corporate and non studio employment costs were achieved through cost containment efforts 
supplemental retirement costs decreased due to lower participation and non recurring charges resulting from the change in control 
the million decrease in selling  general and administrative costs in from is principally the result of million in planned net reductions in advertising costs  lower corporate employment costs of million  and million of net decreases in various other categories of expenses such as travel and meetings  studio supplies  and postage and freight 
these decreases were partially offset by net increases in studio employment costs of  related to the broad restoration of coverage and training hours as well as the startup operation of digital studios  costs and inefficiencies associated both the company s digital conversion efforts as well as with the implementation of the system wide studio hardware upgrade project  increases of million in health insurance costs and approximately  in costs related to professional services incurred in conjunction with the first year of required internal control reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the decline in advertising expenses resulted from a comprehensive evaluation of the productivity of the various vehicles utilized  the result of which was the elimination of high cost  low productivity vehicles and reinvestment in more cost effective vehicles that are anticipated to also be more productive and targeted 
the decline in corporate employment costs resulted from the executive and other corporate staff reductions that took place principally in the first and second quarters of the net decreases in the various other categories mentioned above resulted from the company s ongoing cost reduction initiatives 
the increase in studio employment costs resulted from a strategic decision to restore coverage  training and retention hours in the studio  especially in the second half of that had been substantially reduced in the second half of in response to the declining sales environment 
depreciation and amortization was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in depreciation and amortization is attributable to significant investments that have been made in connection both with a studio wide hardware and printer upgrade in and the recently completed digital conversion of us studios 
the slight net decrease in depreciation expense between and resulted from certain assets becoming fully depreciated in  partially offset by increased depreciation charges related to increased levels of capital spending in and other charges and impairments reflect costs incurred from strategic actions implemented by the company to restructure its operations  costs that are unpredictable and atypical of the company s operations and additional charges due to asset impairments

as a result of this decision  certain previously capitalized software development costs related to the development of the previous platform that no longer had future utility to the company were written off resulting in a charge of million

in exchange for that commitment  the company paid a  non refundable loan commitment fee

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on the company s reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  business auto usage and employee medical claims 
the company has stop loss coverage to limit the exposure arising from these claims 
self insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the company s historical experience 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
income taxes the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by the company are based on management s interpretation of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense also reflects the company s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of the tax laws  and tax planning 
the company assesses temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are shown on our consolidated balance sheet 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent the company believes that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
when a valuation allowance is established or increased in an accounting period  a corresponding tax expense is recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at february   the actuarial assumptions of the company s plans were discount rate for benefit cost  discount rate for benefit obligations  long term rate of return on plan assets  and assumed rate of salary increases 
the company has made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding the company s financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of assessing recoverability of long lived assets and in establishing reserves in connection with restructuring initiatives and other charges and with respect to the company s operating lease guarantees related to its former wall d cor segment 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors 
management s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates and are minimal 
at february   the company s debt obligations have floating interest rates 
the impact of a change in interest rates affecting the company s debt would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  at february   the company s debt obligations had primarily fixed interest rates  therefore  the company s exposure to changes in interest rates in was minimal 
the company s exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the canadian operations is also minimal  as canadian operations constitute only of the company s total assets and of the company s total sales as of and for the year ended february
