we base our judgments  estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we evaluate our judgments  estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the judgments  estimates and assumptions involved in the accounting for income taxes  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and legal contingencies have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
below we discuss the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our judgments  estimates and assumptions relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see the discussion in the section titled results of operations and critical accounting policies below  and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
until the third quarter of  we had provided a full valuation allowance against accumulated deferred tax assets  reflecting the uncertainty associated with our future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of management reassessed the valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets 
factors considered included historical results of operations  volatility of the economic and interest rate environment and projected earnings based on current operations 
based on this evidence  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released  of the valuation allowance  which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately  during the quarters ended march  june  and sept   we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we completed our business planning process during the fourth quarter of  which included the following strategic initiatives for the enhancement of our quality control process and procedures  the re design of our web site  the execution of exclusive advertising contracts with two mortgage lead aggregators  broadening the breadth and depth of our products and services  a reorganization of our advertising sales force  and the migration to a cost per click revenue model on our rate tables 
considering these strategic initiatives and their impact on future earnings potential  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the entire deferred tax asset 
at december   we reversed the remaining  valuation allowance resulting in an income tax benefit of  and a net deferred tax asset of  the realization of the deferred tax asset depends on our ability to continue to generate taxable income in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged against earnings in the period such determination is made 
the income tax benefit relating to stock options exercised in and was approximately  and  respectively  which was allocated to stockholders equity 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to make required payments 
we look at historical write offs and sales growth when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
as of december   our allowance increased as the customer base associated with the acquisitions made during are different than our traditional customers 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if the level of accounts receivable increases  the need for possible additional allowances may be necessary 
any additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and included in general and administrative expenses

the amended complaint sought an undisclosed sum of monetary damages  restitution of profits  compensation acquired as a result of the allegedly wrongful conduct  attorney s fees  costs  and injunctive relief 
we filed a special motion to strike the amended complaint under california s anti slapp strategic lawsuits against public participation statute  contending that i ai s claims against us were all based on publishing decisions protected by the first amendment of the united states constitution and its counterpart in the california constitution  and ii ai could not establish a probability of success on the merits of its claims 
we also filed a demurrer to the amended complaint  contending that it failed to state facts constituting a valid cause of action against the company

all 
defendants wrongful conduct

in connection with the causes of action for intentional interference with economic relations and prospective economic advantage  ai in its statement reserves the right to seek not less than million in punitive damages when it seeks a judgment in the action

we will continue to vigorously defend itself against all of ai s claims 
we have filed two motions for summary adjudication

during  certain traffic initiatives and expanded commitments from our distribution partners  as well as the activity in mortgage lending caused increases in traffic inconsistent with our historical trends that continued through the third quarter of as brand awareness continues to strengthen for bankrate

income taxes our effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate  in primarily due to state income taxes and in and  primarily as a result of the changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as required by sfas no 
 we recognize tax assets on the balance sheet if it is more likely than not that they will be realized on future tax returns 
up to the third quarter of  we had provided a full valuation allowance against accumulated deferred tax assets  reflecting the uncertainty associated with our future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of management reassessed the valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets 
factors considered included historical results of operations  volatility of the economic and interest rate environment and projected earnings based on current operations 
based on this evidence  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  released  of the valuation allowance  which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately  during the quarters ended march  june  and sept   we continued to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we completed our business planning process during the fourth quarter of  which included the following strategic initiatives for the enhancement of our quality control process and procedures  the re design of our web site  the execution of exclusive advertising contracts with two mortgage lead aggregators  broadening the breadth and depth of our products and services  a reorganization of our advertising sales force  and the migration to a cost per click revenue model on our rate tables 
considering these strategic initiatives and their impact on future earnings potential  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the entire deferred tax asset 
at december   we reversed the remaining  valuation allowance  resulting in an income tax benefit of  and a net deferred tax asset of  the realization of the  deferred tax asset depends on our ability to continue to generate taxable income in the future 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or a portion of the deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be charged against earnings in the period such determination is made 
approximately  million of the valuation allowance was attributable to the tax benefit of stock options exercised in a prior year 
the income tax benefit relating to stock options exercised during was approximately  for a total benefit of approximately  which was allocated to stockholders equity

there were no such fees in as the consulting arrangement was terminated in goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  online publishing and print publishing and licensing  under sfas no 
as these are the components of the business for which discrete financial information is available and for which segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  accordingly  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
we will perform an annual impairment review of goodwill for both reporting units on during the fourth quarter of each year 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of all share based payments to directors and employees  including stock option grants  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
in april  the sec announced that the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  as a result  we are now required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas no 
r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
we expect the adoption to significantly reduce earnings per share by approximately

 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no

a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment strategy is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from investments without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize this risk  to date we have maintained our portfolio of cash equivalents in short term and overnight investments that are not subject to market risk  as the interest paid on such investments fluctuates with the prevailing interest rates 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents mature in less than three months 
exchange rate sensitivity our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is minimal to none as we do not have any revenues denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have not engaged in any derivative or hedging transactions to date
