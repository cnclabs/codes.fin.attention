our business we receive revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to various populations with special needs 
as of december   we had three reportable operating segments i disabilities services  ii job corps training services and iii employment training services 
effective january   in order to better reflect the services provided  the disabilities services segment is now named community services and is referenced as such throughout this annual report on form k 
further information regarding our segments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment is included below 
revenues for our community services operations are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  commercial insurance companies and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid program 
our services include social  functional and vocational skills training  supported employment and emotional and psychological counseling for individuals with mental retardation or other disabilities 
we also provide respite  therapeutic and other services on an as needed basis or hourly basis through our periodic in home services programs that are reimbursed on a unit of service basis 
reimbursement varies by state and service type  and may be based on a variety of methods including flat rate  cost based reimbursement  per person per diem  or unit of service basis 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based upon historical costs experienced by us and by other service providers  or economic conditions and their impact on state budgets 
at facilities and programs where we are the provider of record  we are directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services we provide and such revenues are affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that we operate pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated with the provider of record 

table of contents we operate vocational training centers under the federal job corps program administered by the dol through our job corps training services operations 
under job corps contracts  we are reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee 
the management fee can take the form of a fixed contractual amount or be computed based on certain performance criteria 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program costs 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
we operate job training and placement programs that assist disadvantaged job seekers in finding employment and improving their career prospects through our employment training services operations 
these programs are administered through performance based or fixed fee contracts with local and state governments 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and application of our critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicaid programs  other government agencies and commercial insurance companies 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including historical loss rates  age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors  general economic conditions and the status of state budgets 
complex rules and regulations regarding billing and timely filing requirements in various states are also a factor in our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change of estimate 
there were no material changes in our method of providing for reserves for doubtful accounts during reserves for insurance risks we self insure a substantial portion of our professional  general and automobile liability  workers compensation and health benefit risks 
provisions for losses for these risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates and include an amount determined from reported claims and an amount based on past experiences for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while we believe that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts recorded 
the liabilities are reviewed quarterly and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period known 
during  we changed the rate used to discount our estimates of workers compensation claims reserves from to  reflecting our claims payment experience and the current interest rate environment 
the decrease in the discount rate of basis points increased the reserve  and resulting expense  by approximately million 
further information regarding our insurance programs is contained elsewhere in this document under risk factors 

table of contents legal contingencies we are party to numerous claims and lawsuits with respect to various matters 
the material legal proceedings in which rescare is currently involved are described in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable 
we confer with outside counsel in estimating our potential liability for certain legal contingencies 
while we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate  the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates 
there were no material changes to our method of providing reserves for legal contingencies during valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  loss of contracts  significant census declines  reductions in reimbursement levels and significant litigation 
our evaluation is based on cash flow  profitability and projections that incorporate current or projected operating results  as well as significant events or changes in the reimbursement and regulatory environment 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value based upon various techniques to estimate fair value 
we recorded no material asset valuation losses during goodwill with respect to businesses we have acquired  we evaluate the costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired goodwill for impairment at least annually as of year end  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
we are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment and recognize an impairment charge for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
fair values are established using a weighted average of comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 
discounted cash flow computations depend on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the discount rates used as of our year end annual impairment evaluation for the community services  job corps training services and employment training services reporting units were  and  respectively 
a variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the variance analysis 
in addition  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our reporting units 
no valuation losses were recorded during revenue recognition community services 
revenues are derived primarily from state medicaid programs  other government agencies  commercial insurance companies and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid programs 
revenues are recorded at rates established at or before the time services are rendered 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
job corps training services 
revenues include amounts reimbursable under cost reimbursement contracts with the dol for operating job corps centers 
the contracts provide reimbursement for all facility and program costs related to operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a combination of fixed and performance based 
final determination of amounts due under the contracts is subject to audit and review by the applicable government agencies 
revenue is recognized in the period associated costs are incurred and services are rendered 

table of contents employment training services 
revenues are derived primarily through performance based or fixed fee contracts with local and state governments 
revenue is recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
laws and regulations governing the government programs and contracts are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
for each operating segment  expenses are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for potential adjustments arising from such examinations 
there were no material changes in the application of our revenue recognition policies during year in review revenues for the year ended december  were billion  net income was million  and cash provided from operations was million 
these items are discussed in more detail in the following sections of the md a 
the following highlights some of the events of the past year on october   we issued million of senior notes due october  in a private placement under rule a of the securities act of the senior notes  which had an issue price of of the principal amount  are unsecured obligations ranking equal to existing and future debt and are subordinate to existing and future secured debt 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the offering of the senior notes to repurchase the senior notes due november  also on october   we amended and restated our existing senior secured credit facility 
as amended and restated  the facility consists of million revolving credit facility  which could be increased to million at our option and expires on october  the credit facility will be used primarily for letters of credit required under our insurance programs  working capital purposes  and to fund acquisitions 
in connection with these refinancing transactions  in september we repaid our outstanding term loan  which totaled million 
in the fourth quarter  we recorded charges in connection with our october  debt refinancing transaction of approximately million pretax million net of tax  or per share 
in conjunction with the debt refinancing transactions  we will experience a decrease in our interest expense of approximately million in versus related to the million senior notes 
the community services segment added new operations which complement our core business in this segment 
these operations are expected to generate annual revenues of approximately million and provide services to approximately  consumers

for the nine months ended september   the iraq contract generated revenues of approximately million 
on december   we notified the district of columbia that we expect our community services segment to cease providing disabilities services in the district effective during the second quarter of due to higher operating costs and substantial losses resulting from changes in regulatory oversight requirements 
we will likely incur some exit costs for lease terminations and other expenses during for the year ended december   revenues from the district of columbia for disabilities services were approximately million 
in addition  the following events occurred after year end effective january   our employment training services segment completed the purchase of the operating assets and business of the workforce services group of affiliated computer services  inc acs workforce services

operating income decreased in from and operating margin decreased from to 
this decrease is attributed to the million charge recorded in connection with our debt refinancing  offset primarily by the operating margin improvement in the community services segment 
operating income increased in over and operating margin increased from to 
this increase is attributed to the revenue growth and operating margin improvement in the community services discussed below 
as a percentage of total revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses remained consistent at in  in and in as a percent of total revenues  depreciation and amortization remained consistent at in  in and in net interest expense decreased million in compared to due primarily to higher interest rates on investments  the debt refinancing in october and the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes in march interest expense decreased million in compared to  following the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes as of december  our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the effective rate for is lower than the statutory rate principally due to non taxable investment income and the benefit of increased job credits  as compared to the effective rate for was lower than due to non taxable investment income and increased jobs credits as compared to 
table of contents community services community services revenues increased in over compared to a increase in over this increase was due primarily to acquisitions and growth in the higher margin periodic in home services  partially offset by census reductions in the district of columbia 
periodic in home service revenues increased million in over revenues increased in from incremental revenues for new homes added  growth in our periodic in home services and various small acquisitions in operating margin increased in over to from  as a result of continued growth in the periodic in home services  multiple acquisitions in and continued cost controls 
further  insurance costs  including workers compensation  decreased as a percentage of revenue approximately basis points as compared to these improvements were offset by census reductions and increased costs associated with the operating issues we are experiencing in the district of columbia 
operating margin for this division increased to in from in  as a result of continued growth in periodic in home services  new homes added  continued improvement in the management of labor costs and continued cost controls 
rescare has been operating in the district of columbia for many years  however  the regulatory environment and operational issues have resulted in higher operating costs and substantial losses 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced that we are ceasing our community services to individuals with developmental disabilities in the district of columbia by the second quarter of we continue to work with the district and other providers on the ultimate outcome of the homes we are operating 
we do not have sufficient information at this time to estimate the amount of loss  if any  from exiting the business 
we do not believe the exit from the district of columbia will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
job corps training services job corps training services revenues increased in over due primarily to the addition of the northlands job corps center in july and contractual increases 
revenues increased approximately in over due primarily to the addition of the homestead job corps center in april and contractual increases 
operating margins in decreased slightly from due primarily to changes in the dol s incentive based payments 
the performance criteria in is more restrictive in an effort to control costs 
operating margin for decreased slightly from for similar reasons

operating income for this segment increased for over  however operating margins decreased basis points primarily due to the start up of the new york city contract 
operating margin decreased basis points in over due to lower negotiated margins on the additional contracts added in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets increased in over as described below  the increase in accounts receivable is due to increased revenues associated with the acquisitions and contracts awarded during during  we completed acquisitions with aggregate estimated annual revenues of million 
primarily as a result of these acquisitions  goodwill increased million from december  as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million as compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million for and million in the increase in from was primarily the result of higher net income excluding the refinancing loss  offset by net working capital needs 
the decrease in from was primarily the result of tax refunds received in which were not present in 
table of contents days revenue in net accounts receivable were days at december  compared with days at december  and december  the increase in the number of days is attributable to a few states extending payment terms and to the growth in the employment training services segment 
net accounts receivable at december  increased to million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in net accounts receivable from to is primarily due to revenue growth associated with the acquisitions and contract awards 
the increase in net accounts receivable over is due to growth at arbor  new homes growth  and the acquisition of tti in december additionally  we experienced delayed collections in the fourth quarter of from the dol due to changes in the dol s payment processing 
approximately of the total net accounts receivable balance was greater than days at both december  and december  capital expenditures were consistent with the company s historical experience  comprised principally of maintenance capital expenditures  with a less significant amount expended for strategic systems

similarly  approximately million and million were expended in and  on businesses operating in both employment training services and community services 
our financing activities during include the repayment of the million senior notes  the million term loan and the convertible subordinated notes  offset by proceeds from the new million senior notes 
we also incurred various costs in connection with the october refinancing 
option exercise activity resulted in million in proceeds in cash provided by financing activities in was attributable primarily to the june issuance of preferred stock to onex partners 
for  we redeemed the subordinated notes 
our capital requirements relate primarily to our plans to expand through selective acquisitions and the development of new facilities and programs  and our need for sufficient working capital for general corporate purposes 
since most of our facilities and programs are operating at or near capacity  and budgetary pressures and other forces are expected to limit increases in reimbursement rates we receive  our ability to continue to grow at the current rate depends directly on our acquisition and development activity 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from our operating cash flow and utilization of our credit facility 
on october   we issued million of senior notes due october  in a private placement under rule a of the securities act of the new senior notes  which had an issue price of of the principal amount  are unsecured obligations ranking equal to existing and future debt and are subordinate to existing and future secured debt 
the senior notes are jointly  severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our owned us subsidiaries

as amended and restated  the facility consists of million revolving credit facility  which can be increased to million at our option and expires on october  the credit facility will be used primarily for working capital purposes and for letters of credit required under our insurance programs and to finance acquisition and development activities 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets and  through secured guarantees  on all of our domestic subsidiaries assets 
as of december   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued primarily in connection with our insurance programs 
as of december   we had million available under the revolver 
the amended and restated credit facility contains various financial covenants relating to net worth  capital expenditures and rentals and requires us to maintain specified ratios with respect to interest coverage and leverage 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  our ability to achieve the thresholds provided for in the financial covenants largely depends upon the maintenance of continued profitability and or reductions of amounts borrowed under the facility  and continued cash collections 

table of contents included in our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  was million of cash held on deposit with an insurance carrier as collateral for our insurance program 
in october  in accordance with our collateral arrangement with the insurance carrier  we exchanged the million of cash held on deposit for a letter of credit 
operating funding sources for were approximately through medicaid reimbursement  from the dol and from other payors 
we believe our sources of funds through operations and available through the credit facility described above will be sufficient to meet our working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements for the next twelve months
