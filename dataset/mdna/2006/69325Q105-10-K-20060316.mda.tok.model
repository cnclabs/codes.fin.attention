introduction pctel is focused on growing wireless revenue and maximizing the monetary value of its intellectual property 
these are the two key priorities for the company in the company reports revenue and gross profit for apg  rfsg  msg  licensing and modems as separate product segments 
growth in wireless product revenue is dependent both on gaining further revenue traction in the existing product profile as well as further acquisitions to support the wireless initiatives 
revenue growth in the apg segment is tied to emerging wireless applications in broadband wireless  in building wireless  wireless internet service providers  gps and mobile satcom 
the lmr  pmr  dpmr and on glass mobile antenna applications represent mature markets 
a critical factor for revenue growth is the successful absorption of sigma wireless technologies limited sigma acquired in july revenue in the rfsg segment is tied to the deployment of new wireless technology  such as g and g  and the need for existing wireless networks to be tuned and reconfigured on a regular basis 
revenue growth in the msg segment is correlated to the success of data services offered by the customer base 
the roll out of such data services is in the early stage of market development 
licensing revenue is dependent on the signing of new license agreements and the success of the licensees in the marketplace 
new licenses often contain up front payments pertaining to past royalty liability  or one time payments if the license is perpetual 
this can make licensing revenue uneven 
the company has found it necessary to enter into litigation from time to time as a means to bring companies under license 
the company is currently in litigation with agere and lucent over the use of pctel s intellectual property 
this litigation is the single largest opportunity to maximize the monetary value of the company s intellectual property 
our largest revenue segment  apg  was gross profit margin challenged in  primarily due to the operating parameters of the sigma product lines 
a critical factor for gross profit enhancement as well as operating cost efficiency for the company going forward is the successful integration of sigma 
the company is evaluating gross profit and operating expense alternatives with respect to the dublin facility and its integration 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
revenue recognition the company sells antenna products and software defined radio products  and licenses the modem technology through the licensing program 
the company records the sale of these products  including related maintenance  and the licensing of the intellectual property as revenue 
in accordance with sab no 
 the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue for sales of the antenna products and software defined radio products  when title transfers  which is generally upon shipment from the factory 
pctel sells these products into both commercial and secure application government markets 
title for sales into the commercial markets generally transfers upon shipment from the factory 
products that are sold into the secure application government market are generally designed to a unique specification 
title for sales into the government markets generally does not transfer until acceptance for the first units and then upon shipment thereafter 
revenue is recognized for antenna products sold to major distributors upon shipment from the factory 
the company allows its major antenna product distributors to return product under specified terms and conditions 
the company accrues for product returns in accordance with fas  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the company recognizes revenue from the wi fi and cellular mobility software  including related maintenance rights  under sop software revenue recognition 
if the software license is perpetual and vendor specific objective evidence can be established for the software license and any related maintenance rights  the software license revenue is recognized upon delivery of the software and the maintenance is recorded pro rata over the life of the maintenance rights 
if part of the licensing agreement requires engineering services to customize software for the customer needs  the revenue for these services is recognized when the initial software license is delivered 
if vendor specific objective evidence cannot be established  and the only undelivered item is maintenance  the software license revenue  the revenue associated with engineering services  if applicable  and the related maintenance rights are combined and recognized pro rata over the expected term of the maintenance rights 
if vendor specific evidence cannot be established on any of the non maintenance elements  the revenue is recorded pro rata over the life of the contractual obligation 
the company records intellectual property licensing revenue when  it has a licensing agreement  the amount of related royalties is known for the accounting period reported  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
knowledge of the royalty amount specific to an accounting period is either in the form of a royalty report specific to a quarter  a contractual fixed payment in the license agreement specific to a quarter  or the pro rata amortization of a fixed payment related to multiple quarters over those quarters using the operating lease method 
if a license agreement provides for a fixed payment related to periods prior to the license effective date the past and volume based royalties going forward  the fixed payment is recognized at the license effective date and the volume based royalties are recognized as royalty reports are received 
if the license provides for a fixed payment for the past and for a finite future period  to be followed by volume based royalties thereafter  the fixed payment is recorded under the operating lease method and recognized pro rata from the effective date through the end of the period covered by the fixed payment 
if a one time license payment is made for a perpetual license  with no future obligations on behalf of the company  revenue is recognized under the capitalized lease method upon the effective date 
there is one exception to the recognition of intellectual property licensing as revenue 
the company signed a licensing agreement with conexant systems  inc conexant simultaneously with the sale of its hsp modem product line to conexant in because the hsp modem product line also requires a license to the company s patent portfolio  the gain on sale of the product line and the licensing stream are not separable for accounting purposes 
ongoing royalties from conexant are presented in the income statement as gain on sale of assets and related royalties 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and overhead costs 
inventories as of december  and were composed of raw materials  subassemblies  work in process  and finished goods 
the company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand 
reserves for excess inventory are calculated based on the company s estimate of inventory in excess of normal and planned usage 
obsolete reserves are based on the company s identification of inventory having no realizable value 
these reserves are based on the company s estimates and judgments regarding the utilization of the inventory 
due to competitive pressures and technological innovation  the company may have excess inventory in the future 
write downs of inventories would have a negative impact on gross profit 
stock based compensation the company will adopt sfas r in the quarter ending march  on a prospective basis  however  until then  and as currently permitted by sfas accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we continue to apply the accounting provisions of accounting principles board opinion number  accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  with regard to the measurement of compensation cost for options granted under our stock option plans 
the company accounts for the stock option plans whereby compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of a share of the stock at the date of the grant over the amount that must be paid to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options  but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employees using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
the company does not expense stock options  but does expense restricted stock grants 
the company records the issuance of restricted stock grants based on the fair value on the date of the grant and amortizes the value over the life of the restriction using the straight line method 
as required by sfas no 
 the summary pro forma effects to reported income as if the company had elected to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock based awards to the company s employees is disclosed 
the calculation of the fair value of these awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the highly subjective assumptions underlying this model include expected stock price volatility and expected option life 
in advance of adopting sfas r  the company modified the measurement period for calculating volatility 
the company believes five years more accurately measures the expected life or term of the option 
in  the company will also incorporate a forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
in and prior  the company recognized forfeitures as incurred 
all other assumptions will be consistent with the option pricing model 
see footnote related to stock compensation expense 
goodwill and impairment of long lived assets effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  under which goodwill is no longer amortized 
through a third party valuation firm the company assessed the need to record impairment losses on goodwill when indicators of impairment are present such as a significant industry downturn  significant decline in the market value of the company  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
at least annually  typically in the fourth quarter  the company reviews the value of goodwill by reporting unita during this review  the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets are reevaluated 
the company determines whether there has been a permanent impairment of the value of goodwill by comparing future estimated undiscounted cash flows by reporting unit to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
the company conducted the annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  a third party valuation firm was engaged to assist in the evaluation 
the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows for this test was based on historical sales trends  financial projections  market analysis  capital expenditure needs  working capital needs  analyst reports  and other data pertinent to the valuation as provided by the company and obtained from public  financial  and industry sources 
the company s assumptions required significant judgment and actual cash flows may differ from those forecasted 
the company believes the assumptions used for discounting future cash flows were reasonable 
based on the results of the test  there was no impairment of goodwill 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against tax assets  which are not likely to be realized 
the company has international subsidiaries located in japan  china  ireland  united kingdom and israel as well as an international branch office located in hong kong 
the complexities brought on by operating in several different tax jurisdictions inevitably lead to an increased exposure to worldwide taxes 
should review of the tax filings result in unfavorable adjustments to the company s tax returns  the operating results  cash flows  and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
the company believes there will not be any significant adjustments related to foreign taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes  which involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company maintains a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
in the event it was determined that the company could realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
defined benefit retirement plans approximately current and former employees of sigma participate in a defined benefit plan 
prior to the acquisition in july and through december  these employees participated in the sigma communications group retirement and death benefit plan old plan 
effective december  this plan was frozen to new employees 
in january  the sigma participants from the old plan were transferred to a new retirement and death benefit plan pctel europe pension plan or new plan 
the pctel europe pension plan has identical attributes as the old plan 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the measurement of the company s pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions selected by the company and used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates  salary growth  retirement rates  inflation  expected return on plan assets and mortality rates 
the discount rate is the rate of interest used to discount benefit obligations and has been determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds 
the currency and term of the corporate bonds is consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post employment benefit obligations 
at the measurement date of december  the iboxx index of euro denominated aa rated corporate bonds yielded per annum  with individual stocks yielding higher amounts 
taking into account the profile and duration of the plan s liabilities  a discount rate of has been adopted 
the investment strategy pursued by the pension consensus fund is to broadly maintain a diversified portfolio of in real assets such as equities and property  with the balance in monetary assets such as fixed interest and cash 
the expected return on plan assets of was based on the current asset allocation and the long term expected returns for each asset class

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to credit risks and interest rate risk by maintaining a conservative investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in money market funds  which are fixed at per share and for which only the yield fluctuates 
due to changes in interest rates  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  since the company invests in money market funds  we have no unrealized holding gains or losses as of december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned through maturity on investments held at december  we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency fluctuations  as we sell our products internationally 
we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating the majority of transactions in us dollars 
beginning in july  our results include commercial activity by sigma 
sigma transactions are denominated primarily in pounds sterling and euros 
if the united states dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net loss would not have changed by a material amount for the six months ended december  for purposes of this calculation  we have assumed that the exchange rates would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  however  arises in part from translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation gains for the years ended december  and was negative  and positive  respectively
