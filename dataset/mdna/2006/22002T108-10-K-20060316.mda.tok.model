overview we are a reit that focuses on the acquisition  development  ownership  management and leasing of primarily class a suburban office properties in select  demographically strong submarkets where we can achieve critical mass  operating synergies and key competitive advantages  including attracting high quality tenants and securing acquisition and development opportunities 
as of december   our investments in real estate included the following wholly owned operating properties in our portfolio with an average size of  square feet per property  wholly owned office properties under construction or development that we estimate will total approximately million square feet upon completion and one wholly owned office property totaling approximately  square feet that was under redevelopment  wholly owned land parcels totaling acres that we believe are potentially developable into approximately million square feet  and partial ownership interests in a number of other real estate projects in operations or under development or redevelopment 
reits were created by the united states congress in order to provide large numbers of investors with the ability to make investments into entities that own large scale commercial real estate 
one of the unique aspects of a reit is that the entity typically does not pay corporate income tax  provided that the entity distributes of its reit taxable income to its shareholders and meets a number of other strict requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended it is noteworthy that reits are required to distribute a minimum of only of reit taxable income to maintain their tax status as a reit  although any differential between the and would be taxable 
most of our revenues relating to our real estate operations come from rents and property operating expense reimbursements earned from tenants leasing space in our properties 
most of our expenses relating to our real estate operations take the form of property operating costs  such as real estate taxes  utilities and repairs and maintenance  financing costs  such as interest and loan costs  and depreciation and amortization associated with our operating properties 
of the wholly owned operating properties in our portfolio  were located in the mid atlantic region of the united states 
our primary regions as of december  are set forth below baltimore washington corridor defined as the maryland counties of howard and anne arundel  northern virginia defined as fairfax county  virginia  suburban maryland defined as the maryland counties of montgomery  prince george s and frederick  st 
mary s king george counties located in maryland and virginia  respectively  suburban baltimore  maryland  colorado springs  colorado  san antonio  texas  northern central new jersey  and greater philadelphia  pennsylvania 
as of december   of our properties were located in what is widely known as the greater washington  dc region  which includes the first four regions set forth above  and were located in neighboring suburban baltimore 
in  we implemented a core customer expansion strategy built on meeting  through acquisitions and development  the multi location requirements of our strategic tenants  as a result of this strategy  marked our initial entry into the next two regions set forth above san antonio  texas and colorado springs  colorado 
the last two regions set forth above are considered non core to the company 
at december   we also had wholly owned properties in the greater harrisburg  pennsylvania region  in september  we sold of our ownership interest in these properties by contributing them into a real estate joint venture 
we discuss further the geographic concentrations of our property ownership in the section below entitled concentration of operations 
our strategy for operations and growth revolves around our goal to be the landlord of choice for select high quality tenants 
as a result of this strategy  a large concentration of our revenue is derived from several large tenants 
our largest tenants are also heavily concentrated in the united states defense industry 
several noteworthy statistics that demonstrate our tenant and industry concentrations are set forth below percentage of annualized rental revenue of wholly owned properties at december  largest tenant  united states government five largest tenants twenty largest tenants tenants in the united states defense industry defined below in the section entitled geographic concentration of property operations 
we discuss further our lease concentrations in the section below entitled concentration of operations 
in order to maximize the revenue potential of our properties  we try to maintain high levels of occupancy  as a result  we consider occupancy rates to be an important measure of the productivity of our properties 
one way that we attempt to maximize occupancy rates is by renewing a high percentage of our existing tenants  accordingly  tenant renewal rates are important to us in monitoring our leasing activities and tenant relationships 
in managing the effect of our leasing activities on our financial position and future operating performance stability  we also monitor the timing of our lease maturities with the intent that the timing of such maturities not be highly concentrated in a given one year or five year period 
the table below sets forth certain occupancy and leasing information as of or for the year ended december  for our portfolio of wholly owned properties occupancy renewal rate of square footage for scheduled lease expirations during year average contractual annual rental rate per square foot weighted average lease term in years includes estimated expense reimbursements 
see assumption relating to our united states government leases in section entitled occupancy and leasing 
we discuss further in the section entitled results of operations in the subsection entitled occupancy and leasing 
achieving optimal performance from our properties is crucial to our company 
we evaluate the performance of our properties by focusing on changes in revenues from real estate operations comprised of rental revenues and tenant recoveries and other real estate operations revenue and property operating expenses 
however  since we experienced significant growth in number of operating properties between and  our growth in revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses over that timeframe can be misleading 
therefore  we evaluate changes in revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses attributable to property additions separately from the changes attributable to properties that were owned and operational throughout any two periods being compared  properties that we collectively refer to as the same office properties 
during  we experienced significant growth from in our revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses due primarily to the addition of properties through acquisition and construction activities  had a million  or  increase in revenues from the same office properties compared to due primarily to increased operating expense reimbursements at such properties  and had a million  or  increase in property operating expenses from the same office properties compared to due primarily to increased utilities and snow removal expenses 
we discuss further in the section below entitled results of operations in the subsection entitled revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses 
in addition to owning real estate properties  we provide real estate related services that include property management  construction and development management  and heating and air conditioning services and controls 
the gross revenue and costs associated with these services generally bear little relationship to the level of our activity from these operations since a substantial portion of the costs are subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by the customer at no mark up 
as a result  the operating margins from these operations are small relative to the revenue 
we use the net of such revenues and expenses to evaluate the performance of our service operations 
during  we had virtually no change in the operating margins of our service operations compared to these operations are discussed further in the section below entitled income from service operations 
our net income available to common shareholders increased and our diluted earnings per share increased compared to we discuss significant factors contributing to these changes within subsections of the section below entitled results of operations 
highlights of our investing activities are set forth below we acquired office properties totaling million square feet for million  including properties representing our initial entry into the colorado springs  colorado and san antonio  texas regions  we increased our future development capacity by acquiring parcels of land totaling acres  all of which is located near operating properties that we own  for million  we placed into service  square feet in three newly constructed properties  we had nine new properties under construction  three properties under redevelopment and six properties under development at december  we sold four office properties  including three from one of our non core regions  and a land parcel for a total of million  and we sold of the ownership interest in our harrisburg portfolio by contributing it into a real estate joint venture 
highlights of our financing activities are set forth below we increased the maximum principal under our primary revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility from million to million  with a right to further increase the maximum principal in the future to million  we borrowed million under mortgages and other loans  excluding our revolving credit facility  and we sold million common shares to an underwriter for net proceeds totaling approximately million 
we discuss our investing and financing activities further in the section below entitled liquidity and capital resources  along with discussions of  among other things  the following our cash flows  how we expect to generate cash for short and long term capital needs  our off balance sheet arrangements in place that are reasonably likely to affect our financial condition  and our commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies involving estimates and assumptions that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in accounting for highly uncertain matters or matters that are susceptible to change and materially affect our reported operating performance or financial condition 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements 
while reviewing this section  you should refer to note to our consolidated financial statements  including terms defined therein 
when we acquire real estate properties  we allocate the acquisition to numerous tangible and intangible components 
most of the terms in this bullet section are defined in the section of note to the consolidated financial statements entitled acquisitions of real estate 
our process for determining the allocation to these components is very complex and requires many estimates and assumptions 
included among these estimates and assumptions are the following determination of market rental rate  estimates of leasing and tenant improvement costs associated with the remaining term of acquired leases for deemed cost avoidance  leasing assumptions used in determining the lease up value  as if vacant value and tenant relationship value  including the rental rates  period of time that it will take to lease vacant space and estimated tenant improvement and leasing costs  estimate of the property s future value in determining the as if vacant value  estimate of value attributable to market concentration premiums and tenant relationship values  and allocation of the as if vacant value between land and building 
a change in any of the above key assumptions  most of which are extremely subjective  can materially change not only the presentation of acquired properties in our consolidated financial statements but also reported results of operations 
the allocation to different components affects the following the amount of the acquisition costs allocated among different categories of assets and liabilities on our balance sheet  the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions and the amount of costs assigned to individual tenants at the time of acquisition  where the amortization of the components appear over time in our statements of operations 
allocations to the lease to market value component are amortized into rental revenue  whereas allocations to most of the other components the one exception being the land component of the as if vacant value are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense 
as a reit  this is important to us since much of the investment community evaluates our operating performance using non gaap measures such as funds from operations  the computation of which includes rental revenue but does not include depreciation and amortization expense  and the timing over which the items are recognized as revenue or expense in our statements of operations 
for example  for allocations to the as if vacant value  the land portion is not depreciated and the building portion is depreciated over a longer period of time than the other components generally years 
allocations to lease to market value  deemed cost avoidance  lease up value and tenant relationship value are amortized over significantly shorter timeframes  and if individual tenants leases are terminated early  any unamortized amounts remaining associated with those tenants are generally expensed upon termination 
these differences in timing can materially affect our reported results of operations 
in addition  we establish lives for lease up value and tenant relationship value based on our estimates of how long we expect the respective tenants to remain in the properties  establishing these lives requires estimates and assumptions that are very subjective 
when events or circumstances indicate that a property may be impaired  we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
we consider an asset to be impaired when its undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than its depreciated cost 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we compute a real estate asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows and fair value using certain estimates and assumptions 
as a result  these estimates and assumptions impact whether an impairment is deemed to have occurred and the amount of impairment loss that we recognize 
we use four different accounting methods to report our investments in entities the consolidation method  the equity method  the cost method and the financing method see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we use the cost method when we own an interest in an entity and cannot exert significant influence over the entity s operations 
when the cost method does not apply  we evaluate whether or not we can exert significant influence over the entity s operations but cannot control the entity s operations  when considering that  we need to determine whether a situation exists in which the entity is controlled by its owners either us or our joint venture partners without such owners owning most of the outstanding voting rights in the entity 
in performing this evaluation  we typically need to make subjective estimates and judgments regarding the entity s future operating performance  financial condition  future valuation and other variables that may affect the partners share of cash flow from the entity over time 
we also need to estimate the probability of different scenarios taking place over time and project the effect that each of those scenarios would have on variables affecting the partners cash flow 
the conclusion reached as a result of this process affects whether or not we use the consolidation method in accounting for our investment or either the equity or financing method of accounting 
whether or not we consolidate an investment can materially affect our consolidated financial statements

mary s and king george counties n a greater philadelphia northern central new jersey colorado springs  colorado n a n a san antonio  texas n a n a greater harrisburg n a annualized rental revenue is a measure that we use to evaluate the source of our rental revenue as of a point in time 
it is computed by multiplying by the sum of monthly contractual base rents and estimated monthly expense reimbursements under active leases as of a point in time 
we consider annualized rental revenue to be a useful measure for analyzing revenue sources because  since it is point in time based  it does not contain increases and decreases in revenue associated with periods in which lease terms were not in effect  historical revenue under generally accepted accounting principles gaap does contain such fluctuations 
we find the measure particularly useful for leasing  tenant  segment and industry analysis 
concentration of leases with certain tenants we experienced changes in our tenant base during and due primarily to acquisitions  construction and leasing activity 
the following schedule lists our largest tenants in our portfolio of wholly owned properties based on percentage of annualized rental revenue percentage of annualized rental revenue of wholly owned properties for largest tenants as of december  tenant united states government booz allen hamilton  inc northrop grumman corporation computer sciences corporation l communications titan corporation unisys at t corporation general dynamics corporation the aerospace corporation wachovia bank n a the boeing company ciena corporation verisign  inc magellan health services  inc pricewaterhousecoopers llp n a lockheed martin corporation n a n a johns hopkins university merck co  inc wyle laboratories  inc n a n a carefirst  inc and subsidiaries commonwealth of pennsylvania n a bae systems n a n a usinternetworking  inc n a n a comcast cablevision comcast corporation n a n a omniplex world services n a n a subtotal of largest tenants all remaining tenants total includes affiliated organizations and agencies and predecessor companies

our strategy is focused on the formation of strategic alliances with certain of our tenants from the standpoint of fulfilling their real estate needs in multiple locations 
this strategy influences not only our leasing activities but also our acquisition and construction activities 
as a result  our revenue concentration with individual tenants could continue to grow over time as a result of this strategy 
most of the leases with the united states government provide for a series of one year terms or provide for early termination rights 
the government may terminate its leases if  among other reasons  the united states congress fails to provide funding 
industry concentration of tenants the percentage of total annualized rental revenue in our wholly owned properties derived from the united states defense industry increased in each of the last three years 
one reason for this increase is the expansion of the industry in the greater washington  dc region and  in particular  in our submarkets since the events of september  another reason for the increase is that certain of the properties we acquired or constructed in each of the last three years have leases with the united states government and defense contractors 
the table below sets forth the percentage of our annualized rental revenue in our portfolio of wholly owned properties derived from that industry and  by doing so  demonstrates our increasing concentration of annualized rental revenue of wholly owned properties as of december  total portfolio baltimore washington corridor northern virginia suburban baltimore n a n a suburban maryland st 
mary s and king george counties n a colorado springs n a n a san antonio n a n a as noted above  our strategy is focused on the formation of strategic alliances with certain of our tenants from the standpoint of fulfilling their real estate needs in multiple locations 
many of the tenants on which this strategy concentrates are in the united states defense industry 
as a result of this strategy  our revenue concentration from that industry could continue to grow over time 
we classify the revenue from our leases into industry groupings based solely on our knowledge of the tenants operations in leased space 
occasionally  classifications require subjective and complex judgments 
for example  we have a tenant that is considered by many to be in the computer industry  however  since the nature of that tenant s operations in the space leased from us is focused on providing service to the united states government s defense department  we classify the revenue we earn from the lease as united states defense industry revenue 
we do not use independent sources such as standard industrial classification codes for classifying our revenue into industry groupings and if we did  the resulting groupings would be materially different 
results of operations while reviewing this section  you should refer to the tables in the section entitled selected financial data 
you should also refer to the section in this item entitled liquidity and capital resources for certain factors that could negatively affect various aspects of our operations 
occupancy and leasing the table below sets forth leasing information pertaining to our portfolio of wholly owned operating properties december  occupancy rates at year end total baltimore washington corridor northern virginia suburban baltimore suburban maryland st 
mary s and king george counties n a greater philadelphia northern central new jersey colorado springs  colorado n a n a san antonio  texas n a n a greater harrisburg n a renewal rate of square footage for scheduled lease expirations during year average contractual annual rental rate per square foot at year end includes estimated expense reimbursements 
since decreasing to at december  due in large part  in our opinion  to the effects of a national economic downturn  our portfolio of properties posted year end occupancy of approximately for both and we believe that our occupancy rates have benefited from the expansion of the united states defense industry in our largest submarkets 
we also believe that these rates benefited in from a national economic recovery underway in the real estate industry 
our wholly owned portfolio occupancy rate was adversely affected by our acquisition during the year of certain properties with lower occupancy rates  the weighted average occupancy rate of our properties acquired in was at december  we do not believe that the decrease in the renewal rates from to and from to should be interpreted as a trend regarding the ability for us to retain tenants 
we believe that the change in renewal rates is within the normal range we have established over time  which has ranged between and annually and averaged over the last six years 
our average contractual annual rent per square foot decreased from december  to december  due primarily to our acquisition in of properties with rents per square foot that were lower than the average of our existing portfolio 
the average contractual rent per square foot as of december  on properties acquired during was 
the lower rent per square foot on acquisitions can be attributed primarily to the following lower rents in geographic areas where certain acquisitions took place  lower costs for operating expenses and tenant improvements associated with underlying leases in certain acquisitions  and lower rents associated with lower grade space in certain acquisitions 
we believe that there is a fair amount of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for leasing activity in key economic indicators  including employment growth  seem to favor continued strength in our regions real estate markets 
however  the recent and scheduled addition of new square footage in our regions along with continued strong competition from existing properties in these regions present challenges to the company meeting its leasing objectives 
as we discussed above  we believe that our occupancy rates have benefited from the expansion of the united states defense industry in our largest submarkets 
reporting by the base realignment and closure commission of the united states congress during seemed to favor continued expansion in the regions in which our properties are located 
however  while we viewed this reporting as favorable for the company s future leasing outlook  there is uncertainty  particularly in today s political environment  over whether such expansion will actually occur 
despite any uncertainty regarding our leasing outlook  we believe that we are somewhat protected in the short run from a slow down in leasing activity since the weighted average lease term for our wholly owned properties at december  was five years 
in addition  only of our annualized rental revenues at december  were from leases scheduled to expire by the end of looking longer term  of our annualized rental revenues on leases in place as of december  were from leases scheduled to expire by the end of  with no more than scheduled to expire in any one calendar year between and as noted above  most of the leases with our largest tenant  the united states government  provide for consecutive one year terms or provide for early termination rights  all of the leasing statistics set forth above assume that the united states government will remain in the space that they lease through the end of the respective arrangements  without ending consecutive one year leases prematurely or exercising early termination rights 
we report the statistics in this manner since we manage our leasing activities using these same assumptions and believe these assumptions to be probable

revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses we typically view our changes in revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses as being comprised of three main components changes attributable to the operations of properties owned and operational throughout the two years being compared 
we define these as changes from same office properties 
for example  when comparing and  same office properties would be properties owned and operational from january  through december  for further discussion of the concept of operational  you should refer to the section of note of the consolidated financial statements entitled commercial real estate properties 
changes attributable to operating properties acquired during the two years being compared and newly constructed properties that were placed into service and not operational throughout the two years being compared 
we define these as changes from property additions 
changes attributable to properties sold during the two years being compared that are not reported as discontinued operations 
we define these as changes from sold properties 
the tables below set forth the components of our changes in revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses from continuing operations dollars in thousands changes from to property sold additions same office properties properties other total dollar dollar percentage dollar dollar dollar change change change change change change revenues from real estate operations rental revenue tenant recoveries and other real estate operations revenue total property operating expenses straight line rental revenue adjustments included in rental revenue n a amortization of deferred market rental revenue n a number of operating properties included in component category n a includes acquired properties and seven newly constructed properties

includes  among other things  the effects of amounts eliminated in consolidation 
certain amounts eliminated in consolidation are attributable to the property additions and same office properties 
the analysis set forth below in this section pertains to properties included in continuing operations 
as the tables above indicate  our total increase in revenues from real estate operations and property operating expenses from to and from to was attributable primarily to the property additions 
with regard to changes in the property additions operations the real estate operations in associated with our property additions was adversely affected somewhat by our acquisitions carrying occupancy rates that were lower than the average occupancy of our previously existing properties 
acquisitions with particularly low occupancy rates upon acquisition included the following a  square foot property acquired in april that was occupied  a  square foot property acquired in october that was occupied  and a million square foot portfolio acquired in december that was occupied 
we acquired these lower occupancy properties for  among other reasons  what we viewed to be the potential for particularly high rates of return on our investment in these properties if we are successful in stabilizing their operations 
the potential for low rates of return on our investment in these properties  including losses  exists if we are unsuccessful in stabilizing the properties 
the increase in rental revenue of the property additions from to includes million that was attributable to net revenue from the early termination of leases  most of this increase was attributable to one lease termination transaction 
to explain further the concept of net revenue from the early termination of leases  when tenants terminate their lease obligations prior to the end of the agreed lease terms  they typically pay fees to break these obligations 
we recognize such fees as revenue and write off against such revenue any deferred rents receivable and deferred revenue and deferred assets that are amortizable into rental revenue associated with the leases  the resulting net amount is the net revenue from the early termination of the leases see the section entitled revenue recognition in note to our consolidated financial statements 
with regard to changes in the same office properties revenues from real estate operations the change in rental revenue from the same office properties from to included the following a decrease of million in net revenue from the early termination of leases  which included million attributable to one property and million attributable to two additional properties  and an increase of million  or  attributable to changes in occupancy and rental rates between the two periods 
tenant recoveries and other revenue from the same office properties increased from to due primarily to the increase in property operating expenses described below  and the increase in rental revenue from the same office properties from to was attributable primarily to an increase in occupancy and rental rates between the two periods  including million relating to one property 
with regard to changes in the same office properties property operating expenses the increase in the same office properties property operating expenses from to included the following an increase of million  or  in utilities due primarily to our assumption of responsibility for payment of utilities at certain properties due to changes in occupancy and lease structure and rate increases that we believe are the result of a increased oil prices and b energy deregulation in maryland  an increase of million  or  in snow removal expense due to greater snow and ice precipitation in  and an increase of  or  in building cleaning expenses due primarily to our assumption of responsibility for payment of such costs at certain properties due to changes in occupancy and lease structure 
the increase in the same office properties property operating expenses from to included the following an increase of million  or  in property labor costs due primarily to an increase in billable rates of repair and maintenance employees as well as higher than normal hours during the earlier portion of for projects undertaken at certain properties 
of this increase   was attributable to a building that was staffed with employees throughout but not staffed for most of since the increase in billable rates of repairs and maintenance employees contributed to additional profit in our service operations prior to eliminations recorded in consolidation  a significant portion of the increase in our property labor costs was eliminated in consolidation  an increase of  or  in cleaning expenses due primarily to cleaning costs required in at properties that had increased occupancy from  an increase of  or  in general administrative costs allocable to property operations due primarily to an increase in asset management and legal staffing over  an increase of  or  in real estate taxes due primarily to an increase in the assessed value of many of our properties 
this increasing trend was present across all of our regions  an increase of  or  in heating and air conditioning repairs and maintenance  most of which was attributable to a project undertaken at one of our buildings 
a tenant in this building reimbursed us for these costs through its tenant recovery billings  a decrease of million  or  in snow removal due to higher snowfall in  and a decrease of  or  in expense associated with doubtful or uncollectible receivables 
most of this decrease was attributable to a large expense associated with two tenants in coupled with much lower expense in construction contract and other service revenues and expenses the table below sets forth changes in our construction contract and other service revenues and expenses changes from to changes from to other other construction service construction service contract operations contract operations dollar dollar total dollar dollar dollar total dollar change change change change change change service operations revenues expenses income from service operations construction contract revenues were significantly higher in compared to due primarily to a large volume of activity for certain existing contracts in four contracts represented approximately of our construction contract revenue in however  as discussed earlier  we use the net of service operations revenues and expenses to evaluate performance 
during  we had virtually no change in income from service operations compared to the increase in income from other service operations from to was attributable primarily to a  increase in income from the heating and air conditioning services and controls division 
the improvement in income from the heating and air conditioning services and controls division was attributable primarily to increased time and materials billing activity from its service contract and controls product lines 
much of this activity was attributable to several large contracts 
depreciation and amortization the million change in depreciation and amortization associated with real estate operations included in continuing operations from to included the following a million increase attributable to the property additions  and a million  or  increase attributable to the same office properties 
of the million increase in our depreciation and other amortization associated with real estate operations included in continuing operations from to  million was attributable to the property additions  which included million recorded in connection with one lease termination transaction 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from to this increase included the following an increase of million in compensation expense due primarily to additional employee positions to support our growth  increased expenses associated with share based compensation and increased salaries and bonuses for existing employees  an increase of  in consulting expense due in large part to the growth and changing complexity of the company  and a decrease of  associated with additional overhead allocated to the service operations due primarily to growth in the entities engaged in these operations 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from to this increase included the following an increase of million in compensation expense due primarily to additional employee positions to support our growth  increased expenses associated with share based compensation and increased salaries and bonuses for existing employees  an increase of  in consulting expense which included  among other things  our sarbanes oxley section preparation and increased external audit fees relating thereto  an increase of  for marketing and investor relations activity due to an increased emphasis on such activity  and an increase of  in trustees and officers insurance costs due to additional coverage and higher rates 
general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of operating income from in to in and to in while the main components of the increase from a dollar perspective are discussed above  there is an increasing trend that can be attributed to our adjusting the size of our employee base in response to the growth of the company 
we expect this trend to continue in the next two to three years and perhaps longer until we believe the company s employee base and processes are positioned appropriately in anticipation of our future growth expectations 
interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs our interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs included in continuing operations increased million  or  from to due primarily to a increase in our average outstanding debt balance resulting from our and acquisition and construction activities  offset by a million increase in interest capitalized to construction and pre construction projects due to increased construction and pre construction activity 
interest expense and deferred financing costs as a percentage of net operating income increased from in to in due primarily to an increase in the proportion of our investing and financing activities funded by debt versus equity 
our interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs included in continuing operations increased million  or  from to due primarily to an increase in our average outstanding debt balance resulting from our and acquisition and development activities  offset by the effects of a million increase in the amount of interest capitalized to construction and development projects due to increased construction and pre construction activity and a decrease in our weighted average interest rates from to 
interest expense and deferred financing costs as a percentage of net operating income decreased from in to in due primarily to a decrease in the proportion of our investing and financing activities funded by debt versus equity 
we historically have financed our long term capital needs  including property acquisition and development activities  through a combination of the following borrowings under our revolving credit facility  borrowings from new loans  issuances of common shares of beneficial interest common shares  preferred shares of beneficial interest preferred shares and common units and or preferred units in our operating partnership  contributions from outside investors into real estate joint ventures  proceeds from sales of real estate  and any available residual cash flow from operations after application to the items described in the previous paragraph 
many factors go into our decisions of when to finance investing and financing activities using debt versus equity 
we generally use long term borrowing as attractive financing conditions arise and equity issuances as attractive equity market conditions arise 
as a result  the changes in the proportion between debt and equity described above are not trends that necessarily should be expected to continue 
as of december   of our mortgage and other loans payable balance carried fixed interest rates and of our fixed rate loans were scheduled to mature after for a more comprehensive presentation of our fixed rate loan maturities  please refer to the section entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
minority interests interests in our operating partnership are in the form of preferred and common units 
the line entitled minority interests in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of operations includes primarily income before minority interests allocated to preferred and common units not owned by us  for the amount of this line attributable to preferred units versus common units  you should refer to our consolidated statements of operations 
income is allocated to minority interest preferred unitholders in an amount equal to the priority return from the operating partnership to which they are entitled 
income is allocated to minority interest common unitholders based on the income earned by the operating partnership after allocation to preferred unitholders multiplied by the percentage of the common units in the operating partnership owned by those common unitholders 
as of december   we owned of the outstanding preferred units and approximately of the outstanding common units 
changes in the percentage of the operating partnership owned by minority interests during the last three years reflected the following the issuance of additional units to us as we issued new preferred shares and common shares during through due to the fact that we receive preferred units and common units in the operating partnership each time we issue preferred shares and common shares  the exchange of common units for our common shares by certain minority interest holders of common units  our repurchase of the series c preferred units from third parties in june as discussed in the section below entitled adjustments to net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders  the conversion of the series d preferred shares of beneficial interest the series d preferred shares as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our redemption of the series b preferred shares in july as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our issuance of  common units to third parties in connection with acquisitions during  and our issuance of the series i preferred units to a third party in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our income allocated to minority interest holders of preferred units increased from to due to our issuance of the series i preferred units in september and decreased from to due to our repurchase of the series c preferred units in january our changes in income allocated to minority interest holders of common units included in discontinued operations included the following a decrease attributable to our increasing ownership of common units from at december  to at december  and preferred units  and a decrease from to and an increase from to due to changes in the operating partnership s income from continuing operations before minority interests 
income from discontinued operations our income from discontinued operations increased from to due primarily to the sale of three properties in the northern central new jersey region in september our income from discontinued operations decreased from to due primarily to the sale of a property in the suburban maryland region in march see note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of income from discontinued operations 
adjustments to net income to arrive at net income available to common shareholders preferred share dividends decreased from to due to the conversion of the series d preferred shares and the redemption of the series b preferred shares discussed above 
preferred share dividends increased from to due to the dividend requirements of two new series of preferred shares issued in  offset somewhat by the decrease caused by the redemption of the series b preferred shares and conversion of the series d preferred shares in during  we recognized a million decrease to net income available to common shareholders pertaining to the original issuance costs incurred on the series b preferred shares 
we redeemed these shares in july for a redemption price of million 
we would recognize additional decreases to net income available to common shareholders in the future if we choose to redeem our other outstanding redeemable preferred shares 
our series e and series f redeemable preferred shares are redeemable beginning in during  we recognized an million decrease to net income available to common shareholders  representing the excess of the repurchase price of the series c preferred units in the operating partnership over the sum of the recorded book value of the units and the accrued and unpaid return to the unitholder 
prior to this repurchase  these units were convertible  subject to certain restrictions  into  common units in the operating partnership 
these units were repurchased by the operating partnership for million including  for accrued and unpaid distributions  or per common share on an as converted basis 
diluted earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share on net income available to common shareholders increased from to due to the effect of the increase in net income available to common shareholders  attributable primarily to the reasons set forth above  offset somewhat by the higher number of common shares outstanding due to share issuances in and diluted earnings per common share on net income available to common shareholders increased from to due primarily to the million decrease to net income available to common shareholders in representing the excess of the repurchase price of the series c preferred units over the sum of the recorded book value of the units and the accrued and unpaid return to the unitholder 
this increase was offset somewhat by the issuance costs associated with the redeemed series b preferred shares and the increased common shares outstanding due to common share issuances in and liquidity and capital resources in our discussion of liquidity and capital resources set forth below  we describe certain of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business 
however  they may not be the only ones that we face 
cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  totaled million  an increase of from the balance as of december  the balance of cash and cash equivalents that we carried as of the end of each of the eight calendar quarters during the two years ended december  ranged from million to million and averaged million 
the cash and cash equivalents balances that we carry as of a point in time can vary significantly due in part to the inherent variability of the cash needs of our acquisition and development activities 
we maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet our operating cash requirements and short term investing and financing cash requirements 
when we determine that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand is more than we need to meet such requirements  we may pay down our revolving credit facility or forgo borrowing under construction loan credit facilities to fund development activities 
operating activities we generate most of our cash from the operations of our properties 
a review of our consolidated statements of operations indicates that over the last three years  to of our revenues from real estate operations of our continuing operations defined as the sum of rental revenue and tenant recoveries and other real estate operations revenue were used for property operating expenses of our continuing operations 
most of the amount by which our revenues from real estate operations exceeded property operating expenses was cash flow  we applied most of this cash flow towards interest expense  scheduled principal amortization on mortgage loans  dividends to our shareholders  distributions to minority interest holders of preferred and common units in the operating partnership  capital improvements and leasing costs for our operating properties and general and administrative expenses 
our cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap increased million  or  from to  this increase is attributable primarily to the additional cash flow from operations generated by our newly acquired and newly constructed properties 
we expect to continue to use cash flow provided by operations to meet our short term capital needs  including all property operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  scheduled principal amortization of mortgage loans  dividends and distributions and capital improvements and leasing costs 
we do not anticipate borrowing to meet these requirements 
factors that could negatively affect our ability to generate cash flow from operations in the future include the following we earn revenue from renting our properties 
our operating costs do not necessarily fluctuate in relation to changes in our rental revenue 
this means that our costs will not necessarily decline and may increase even if our revenues decline 
for new tenants or upon lease expiration for existing tenants  we generally must make improvements and pay other tenant related costs for which we may not receive increased rents 
we also make building related capital improvements for which tenants may not reimburse us 
when leases for our properties expire  our tenants may not renew or may renew on terms less favorable to us than the terms of their original leases 
if a tenant leaves  we can expect to experience a vacancy for some period of time as well as higher tenant improvement and leasing costs than if a tenant renews 
as a result  our financial performance could be adversely affected if we experience a high volume of tenant departures at the end of their lease terms 
as discussed earlier  we are dependent on a highly concentrated number of tenants for a large percentage of our revenue 
most of the leases of one of these tenants  the united states government  provide for a series of one year terms or provide for early termination rights 
our cash flow from operations would be adversely affected if our larger tenants failed to make rental payments to us  or if the united states government elects to terminate several of its leases and the space cannot be re leased on satisfactory terms 
as discussed earlier  a high concentration of our revenues comes from tenants in the united states defense industry 
a reduction in government spending for defense could affect the ability of our tenants in the defense industry to fulfill lease obligations or decrease the likelihood that these tenants will renew their leases 
in the case of the united states government  a reduction in government spending could result in the early termination of leases 
our performance depends on the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease obligations by paying their rental payments in a timely manner 
in addition  as noted above  we rely on a relatively small number of tenants for a large percentage of our revenue from real estate operations 
if one of our major tenants  or a number of our smaller tenants  were to experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcy  insolvency or general downturn of business  there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we provide construction management services for third party clients 
when providing these services  we usually pay for the costs of construction and subsequently bill our clients for the costs of construction plus a construction management fee 
when we provide construction management services  the costs of construction can amount to millions of dollars 
if any of our clients for construction management services fail to reimburse us for costs incurred under a significant construction management contract  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
since our properties are primarily located in the mid atlantic region of the united states  especially in the greater washington  dc region  and are also typically concentrated in office parks in which we own most of the properties  we do not have a broad geographic distribution of our properties 
as a result  a decline in the real estate market or general economic conditions in the mid atlantic region  the greater washington  dc region or the office parks in which our properties are located could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the commercial real estate market is highly competitive 
we compete for the purchase of commercial property with many entities  including other publicly traded commercial reits 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
if our competitors prevent us from buying properties that we target for acquisition  we may not be able to meet our property acquisition and development goals 
moreover  numerous commercial properties compete for tenants with our properties 
some of the properties competing with ours may have newer or more desirable locations or the competing properties owners may be willing to accept lower rates than are acceptable to us 
competition for property acquisitions  or for tenants in properties that we own  could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
if short term interest rates were to increase  the interest payments on our variable rate debt would increase  although this increase may be reduced to the extent that we have interest rate swap and cap agreements outstanding 
if longer term interest rates were to increase  we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness on terms as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness and we would pay more for interest expense on new indebtedness that we incur for future operating property additions 
our portfolio of properties is insured for losses under our property  casualty and umbrella insurance policies through september these policies include coverage for acts of terrorism 
although we believe that we adequately insure our properties  we are subject to the risk that our insurance may not cover all of the costs to restore properties damaged by a fire or other catastrophic event 
in addition  changes in the insurance industry could occur in the future that may increase the cost of insuring our properties and decrease the scope of insurance coverage  either of which could adversely affect our financial position and operating results 
as a reit  we must distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income excluding capital gains  which limits the amount of cash we have available for other business purposes  including amounts to fund our growth 
also  it is possible that because of the differences between the time that we actually receive revenue or pay expenses and the period we report those items for distribution purposes  we may have to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirement 
we may become subject to tax liabilities that adversely affect our operating cash flow 
investing and financing activities during the year ended december  we acquired office properties totaling million square feet and ten parcels of land for million  excluding the effect of a  premium recorded upon the assumption of a loan in connection with the acquisition of one of the properties 
these acquisitions were financed using the following million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  million in borrowings from new and assumed mortgage loans  million from the issuance of common units in the operating partnership  and cash reserves for the balance 
highlights of our acquisitions are set forth below most of these acquisitions represented additions to our existing presence in the greater washington  dc region and neighboring suburban baltimore regions 
as discussed above  we implemented in a core customer expansion strategy built on meeting  through acquisitions and development  the multi location requirements of our strategic tenants 
as a result of this strategy  marked our initial entry into the san antonio  texas and colorado springs  colorado regions 
acquisitions in these new regions totaled million 
our acquisitions included for land parcels 
all of the land parcels are located near our existing operating properties 
these additional land holdings significantly increased our future development capacity and enhanced our ability to satisfy our tenants future space requirements 
we also acquired two properties totaling approximately  square feet through a consolidated joint venture in which we own a interest for million 
this joint venture will focus on the identification and acquisition of properties for renovation into higher class space see the section below entitled off balance sheet arrangements 
we initially financed these acquisitions using the following million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and cash reserves for the balance 
we expect the joint venture to repay us for a significant portion of the cost of these acquisitions using construction loan facilities and contributions from our joint venture partner 
during  we placed into service  square feet in three newly constructed properties in the baltimore washington corridor 
these properties were leased at december  costs incurred on these properties through december  totaled million  million of which was incurred in we financed the costs using primarily borrowings under existing construction loan facilities 
at december   we had construction activities underway on nine office properties totaling million square feet that were pre leased  including  square feet in one property placed into service in costs incurred on these properties through december  totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was incurred in we have construction loan facilities in place totaling million to finance the construction of four of these properties  borrowings under these facilities totaled million at december   all of which was borrowed during the year ended december  the remaining costs incurred in were funded using primarily borrowings from our revolving credit facility and cash reserves 
the table below sets forth the major components of our additions to the line entitled total commercial real estate properties on our consolidated balance sheets for in thousands acquisitions construction and development tenant improvements on operating properties capital improvements on operating properties tenant improvement costs incurred on newly constructed properties are classified in this table as construction and development 
during  we sold four office properties and a land parcel for a total of million 
the net proceeds from these sales after transaction costs totaled million  these proceeds were used as follows million to pay down our revolving credit facility  and the balance to fund cash reserves 
on september   we contributed our portfolio of properties in greater harrisburg  consisting of office properties  one unimproved land parcel and an option to acquire a land parcel  into a real estate joint venture at a value of million 
in exchange for our contribution  we received million in cash after closing costs and operating prorations and a interest in harrisburg corporate gateway partners  lp the cash proceeds were used primarily to pay down our revolving credit facility 
we often use our revolving credit facility initially to finance much of our investing and financing activities 
we then pay down our revolving credit facility using proceeds from long term borrowings collateralized by our properties as attractive financing conditions arise and equity issuances as attractive equity market conditions arise 
on june   we amended our revolving credit facility 
under the amendment  the maximum principal amount was increased from million to million  with a right to further increase the maximum principal amount in the future to million  subject to certain conditions 
in addition  the scheduled maturity date was extended for one year to march  with a one year extension available  subject to certain conditions 
the facility has a fee of to on the amount of the credit facility that is unused 
amounts available under this revolving credit facility are generally computed based on of the unencumbered asset pool value increased from prior to the amendment 
based on the value of assets identified by the company to support repayment of the revolving credit facility  million was available as of march   million of which was unused 
during  we borrowed million under mortgages and other loans  excluding our revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from these borrowings were used as follows million to pay down our revolving credit facility  million to finance acquisitions  million from construction loans to finance construction activities  million to refinance other existing debt  and the balance to fund cash reserves  much of which was also used to finance construction activities  and new loan escrow requirements 
on april   we entered into a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of on a notional amount of million 
we obtained this swap to lock in the year libor swap rate in contemplation of our obtaining a long term  fixed rate financing later in we obtained this long term financing in october and cash settled the swap at that time for a payment of  this payment represented the present value of the basis point differential between and the year libor swap rate at the time we cash settled the swap  plus accrued interest 
certain of our mortgage loans require that we comply with a number of restrictive financial covenants  including leverage ratio  minimum net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage  minimum debt service and maximum secured indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
on september   we sold million common shares to an underwriter at a net price of per share 
we contributed the net proceeds totaling approximately million to our operating partnership in exchange for million common units 
the proceeds were used primarily to pay down our revolving credit facility 
analysis of cash flow associated with investing and financing activities our net cash flow used in investing activities increased million  or  from to this increase was due primarily to the following a million  or  increase in purchases of and additions to commercial real estate 
this increase is due primarily to an increase in property acquisitions 
our ability to locate and complete acquisitions is dependent on numerous variables and  as a result  is inherently subject to significant fluctuation from period to period 
while we expect to continue to acquire properties in the future  we are unable to predict whether the increasing acquisition volume is a trend that will continue  and a million increase in proceeds from sales of properties and contributions of assets to an unconsolidated real estate joint venture 
we generally do not acquire properties with the intent of selling them 
we generally attempt to sell a property when we believe that most of the earnings growth potential in that property has been realized  or determine that the property no longer fits within our strategic plans due to its type and or location 
while we expect to reduce or eliminate our real estate investments in certain of our non core markets in the future  we cannot predict when and if these dispositions will occur 
since our real estate sales activity is driven by transactions unrelated to our core operations  our proceeds from sales of properties are subject to material fluctuation from period to period and  therefore  we do not believe that the change described above is necessarily indicative of a trend 
our cash flow provided by financing activities increased million  or  from to this increase included the following a million  or  increase in proceeds from mortgage and other loans payable 
this increase is due primarily to the following borrowings under our revolving credit facility that were used to fund our loan refinancings and property acquisitions  and borrowing under two loans totaling million that were used primarily to pay down the revolving credit facility and refinance other existing debt 
a million  or  increase in repayments of mortgage and other loans payable 
this increase is attributable primarily to the additional repayments of existing loans using borrowings under our new revolving credit facility and the new loans described above  a million  or  decrease in common share issuances completed due primarily to us making fewer new share issuances through public offerings 
we funded a larger proportion of our investing and financing activities using debt than we did in the previous year  and a million payment to redeem the series b preferred shares in we may use cash in to redeem our outstanding series e and series f redeemable preferred shares 
off balance sheet arrangements some of our real estate investments are owned through joint ventures 
we use joint ventures from time to time for reasons that include the following they can provide a facility to access new markets and investment opportunities while enabling us to benefit from the expertise of our partners  they are an alternative source for raising capital to put towards acquisition or development activities  and they can reduce our exposure to risks associated with a property and its activities 
each of our real estate joint ventures has a two member management committee that is responsible for making major decisions as defined in the joint venture agreement  and we control one of the management committee positions in each case 
all of our real estate joint venture investments owned during can be classified into one of the three categories described below externally managed construction joint ventures the construction jvs 
these joint ventures generally construct buildings to be purchased by us 
our partners in these joint ventures are controlled by a company that owns  manages  leases and develops properties in the baltimore washington corridor  that company also serves as the project manager for all of these joint ventures 
these joint ventures enable us to make use of the expertise of our partner 
the use of the joint venture structures provides further leverage to us both from a financing and risk perspective 
we generally guarantee the repayment of construction loans for these projects in amounts proportional to our ownership percentage 
in addition  we are obligated to acquire our partners membership interest in each of the joint ventures if defined events were to occur 
the amount we would be required to pay for those membership interests is computed based on the amount that the owners of those interests would receive under the joint venture agreements in the event that office properties owned by the respective joint ventures were sold for a capitalized fair value as defined in the agreements on a defined date 
during  we were invested in three of these joint ventures  all of which we accounted for using the consolidation method of accounting 
regarding these joint ventures  we acquired our partner s interest in one of these joint ventures during for million  were under contract at december  to sell the property owned by another of these joint ventures to a third party for million 
we acquired our partner s interest in the joint venture for million and completed the sale on january   and estimate the aggregate amount we would need to pay for our partner s membership interest in the one remaining joint venture to be  however  since the determination of this amount is dependent on the operations of the office properties and none of these properties are both completed and occupied  this estimate is preliminary and could be materially different from the actual obligation 
externally managed redevelopment joint venture the redevelopment jv 
formed in  this joint venture identifies and acquires properties to renovate into class a office space and completes such renovations 
our joint venture partner has expertise in these types of projects and serves as the project manager for the renovations 
this joint venture enables us to make use of the expertise of our partner 
the use of the joint venture structure provides further leverage to us both from a financing and risk perspective 
upon stabilization of the renovated properties  we have the option to acquire such properties at of the fair market value  as defined in the joint venture agreement 
we own a interest in our one existing joint venture and account for this investment using the consolidation method of accounting 
our partner will earn fees for the acquisition  development  leasing and disposition of these projects 
we will obtain third party financing for construction of the projects and will act as the guarantor for repayment when required and will earn fees for these activities 
we will also manage the properties when they become operational and will earn fees for such services 
operating joint ventures to which we contribute an office property to partially dispose of our interest the disposition jvs 
during  we owned two investments in disposition jvs to which we contributed office properties in exchange for cash and interests in the joint ventures  one of these joint ventures was created in upon the contribution by us of our portfolio of properties in harrisburg  pennsylvania in exchange for million in cash after closing costs and operating prorations and a interest in the joint venture 
these disposition jvs enable us to dispose of most of our investment in properties that we believe realized most of their earnings growth potential 
we manage the joint ventures property operations and any required construction projects and earn fees for these services 
in one of the joint ventures  our partner has preference in receiving distributions of cash flows for a defined return  once our partner receives its defined return  we are entitled to receive distributions for a defined return and  once we receive that return  remaining distributions of cash flows are allocated based on percentages defined in the joint venture agreement 
in the other joint venture  we and our partner receive returns in proportion to our investments 
as part of our obligations under the joint venture created in  we may be required to make unilateral payments to fund rent shortfalls on behalf of a tenant that was in bankruptcy at the time the joint venture was formed  our total unilateral commitment under this guaranty is approximately  although the tenant s account was current as of december  we also agreed to indemnify the partnership s lender for of losses under standard nonrecourse loan guarantees environmental indemnifications and guarantees against fraud and misrepresentation during the period of time in which we manage the partnership s properties  we do not expect to incur any losses under these loan guarantees 
we accounted for our investments in the disposition jvs using the equity method of accounting 
the table below sets forth certain additional information regarding the disposition jvs since our investments in these joint ventures were not consolidated in thousands fees balance of obligation to net cash earned debt unilaterally investment inflow from loss from from guaranteed fund additional category of real balances category category category by us at project costs estate joint venture at in in in if necessary disposition jvs fees earned by us for construction  asset management and property management services provided to joint ventures 
amounts reported in this column represent additional investments we could be required to fund on a unilateral basis  including the rent shortfall payments and lender indeminfications discussed above 
we and our partners are also required to fund proportionally based on our ownership percentage additional amounts when needed 
since the additional fundings described in this footnote are uncertain in dollar amount and we do not expect that they will be necessary  they are not included in the table 
our investment balance includes distributions in excess of investment of  in one joint venture due to our not recognizing gain on the contribution of properties into the joint venture 
we did not recognize a gain on the contribution since we have contingent obligations  as described above  that may exceed our proportionate interest remaining in effect as long as we continue to manage the joint venture s properties 
includes  in cash proceeds from the contribution of our properties in harrisburg  pennsylvania in exchange for cash and a interest in the joint venture 
you should refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements for additional information pertaining to our investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures 
we had no other material off balance sheet arrangements during contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands for the years ended december  to to thereafter total contractual obligations mortgage and other loans payable interest on mortgage and other loans payable acquisitions of properties new construction and development contracts and obligations third party construction and development contracts capital expenditures for operating properties operating leases capital lease obligations other purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the contractual obligations set forth in this table generally exclude individual contracts that had a value of less than thousand 
also excluded are contracts associated with the operations of our properties that may be terminated with notice of one month or less  which is the arrangement that applies to most of our property operations contracts 
not included in this section are amounts contingently payable by us to acquire the membership interests of certain real estate joint venture partners 
see the section entitled off balance sheet arrangements for further discussion of such amounts 
represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net premiums and discounts of million 
our loan maturities in include million that may be extended until  subject to certain conditions  and million that we expect to refinance  the balance of the maturities represent primarily scheduled principal amortization payments that we expect to pay using cash flow from operations 
represents interest costs for mortgage and other loans payable at december  for the terms of such loans 
for variable rate loans  the amounts reflected above used december  interest rates on variable rate loans in computing interest costs for the terms of such loans 
for construction loan facilities where the interest payments are not payable as incurred but  rather  are added to the balance of the loan during the construction period  the amounts reflected above assumed that such interest costs are paid monthly as incurred 
represents contractual obligation at december  to acquire a property located in washington county  maryland 
we expect to acquire this property in using borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
a million final payment of the acquisition cost included in the thereafter column could be reduced by a range of  to the full million  the amount of such decrease will be determined based on defined levels of job creation resulting from the future development of the property taking place 
represents contractual obligations pertaining to new construction and development activities 
we expect to finance these costs primarily using proceeds from our revolving credit facility and construction loans 
because of the long term nature of certain construction and development contracts  some of these costs will be incurred beyond represents contractual obligations pertaining to projects for which we are acting as construction manager on behalf of unrelated parties who are our clients 
we expect to be reimbursed in full for these costs by our clients 
represents contractual obligations pertaining to capital expenditures for our operating properties 
we expect to finance all of these costs using cash flow from operations 
we expect to pay these items using cash flow from operations 
investing and financing activity subsequent to december  on january   we placed into service a newly constructed property in the baltimore washington corridor totaling approximately  square feet 
on january   we acquired our partner s interest in a joint venture that had constructed a building in the baltimore washington corridor for million using cash reserves 
we then sold the property to a third party for million and used the proceeds to fund the acquisition of the colorado springs property discussed below 
on january   we acquired an office property to be redeveloped that is located in colorado springs  colorado totaling approximately  square feet for a contract price of million 
the acquisition also included land that we believe can accommodate  additional square feet 
the acquisition was financed primarily using proceeds from the property sale discussed above 
on january   we acquired a acre land parcel adjacent to properties that we own in san antonio  texas for a contract price of million 
we believe that the parcel can support the future development of approximately  square feet of office space 
the acquisition was financed primarily using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   we sold two properties that we own in the baltimore washington corridor totaling approximately  square feet for a contract price of million 
we used the proceeds from the sale to pay down our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this sale  we executed a million letter of credit agreement with a lender to release these properties as collateral on an outstanding loan from the lender pending the substitution of two other buildings as collateral  which is expected to be completed by mid on february   we acquired a interest in a joint venture owning a land parcel that is located adjacent to properties that we own in the baltimore washington corridor for million using cash reserves 
the joint venture is constructing an office property totaling approximately  square feet on the land parcel 
on february   we acquired a acre land parcel that is located near properties we own in the baltimore washington corridor for a contract price of million using cash reserves 
on march   we sold a property that we own in the northern central new jersey region totaling approximately  square feet for a contract price of million 
we used the proceeds from the sale to pay down our revolving credit facility 
other future cash requirements for investing and financing activities as previously discussed  as of december   we had construction activities underway on nine office properties totaling million square feet that were pre leased 
we estimate remaining costs to be incurred will total approximately million upon completion of these properties  we expect to incur these costs primarily in and we have million remaining to be borrowed under construction loan facilities totaling million for four of these properties 
we expect to fund the remaining portion of these costs using primarily borrowings from new construction loan facilities 
as of december   we had pre construction activities underway on six new office properties estimated to total  square feet 
we estimate that costs for these properties will total approximately million 
as of december   costs incurred on these properties totaled million and the balance is expected to be incurred from through we expect to fund most of these costs using borrowings from new construction loan facilities 
as of december   we had redevelopment activities underway on three properties totaling  square feet 
two of these properties are owned by a joint venture in which we own a interest 
we estimate that remaining costs of the redevelopment activities will total approximately million 
we expect to fund most of these costs using borrowings under new construction loan facilities 
included in our acquisitions were two office properties in san antonio  texas totaling  square feet 
we expect to incur approximately million in improvements for these properties from to we expect to fund most of these costs using borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
during and beyond  we expect to complete other acquisitions of properties and commence construction and pre construction activities in addition to the ones previously described 
we expect to finance these activities as we have in the past  using mostly a combination of borrowings from new loans  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  proceeds from sales of existing properties and additional equity issuances of common and or preferred shares 
factors that could negatively affect our ability to finance our long term financing and investing needs in the future include the following our strategy is to operate with slightly higher debt levels than many other reits 
however  these higher debt levels could make it difficult to obtain additional financing when required and could also make us more vulnerable to an economic downturn 
most of our properties have been mortgaged to collateralize indebtedness 
in addition  we rely on borrowings to fund some or all of the costs of new property acquisitions  construction and development activities and other items 
we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness 
much of our ability to raise capital through the issuance of preferred shares  common shares or securities that are convertible into our common shares is dependent on the value of our common and preferred shares 
as is the case with any publicly traded securities  certain factors outside of our control could influence the value of our common and preferred shares 
these conditions include  but are not limited to market perception of reits in general and office reits in particular  market perception of reits relative to other investment opportunities  the level of institutional investor interest in our company  general economic and business conditions  prevailing interest rates  and market perception of our financial condition  performance  dividends and growth potential 
in  we completed acquisitions of properties in regions where we did not previously own properties 
moreover  we expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of properties in new regions 
these acquisitions may entail risks in addition to those we have faced in past acquisitions  such as the risk that we do not correctly anticipate conditions or trends in a new region and are therefore not able to operate the acquired property profitably 
when we develop and construct properties  we assume the risk that actual costs will exceed our budgets  that we will experience construction or development delays and that projected leasing will not occur  any of which could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  we generally do not obtain construction financing commitments until the development stage of a project is complete and construction is about to commence 
we may find that we are unable to obtain financing needed to continue with the construction activities for such projects 
we invest in certain entities in which we are not the exclusive investor or principal decision maker 
aside from our inability to unilaterally control the operations of these joint ventures  our investments entail the additional risks that the other parties to these investments may not fulfill their financial obligations as investors  in which case we may need to fund such parties share of additional capital requirements and the other parties to these investments may take actions that are inconsistent with our objectives 
real estate investments can be difficult to sell and convert to cash quickly  especially if market conditions are depressed 
such illiquidity will tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio of properties promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
moreover  under certain circumstances  the internal revenue code imposes certain penalties on a reit that sells property held for less than four years 
in addition  for certain of our properties that we acquired by issuing units in our operating partnership  we are restricted by agreements with the sellers of the properties for a certain period of time from entering into transactions such as the sale or refinancing of the acquired property that will result in a taxable gain to the sellers without the sellers consent 
due to all of these factors  we may be unable to sell a property at an advantageous time to fund our long term capital needs 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these laws can impose liability on property owners or operators for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on a property  even if the property owner was not responsible for the release of the hazardous substances 
costs resulting from environmental liability could be substantial 
the presence of hazardous substances on our properties may also adversely affect occupancy and our ability to sell or borrow against those properties 
in addition to the costs of government claims under environmental laws  private plaintiffs may bring claims for personal injury or other reasons 
additionally  various laws impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility 
anyone who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such a facility is potentially liable under such laws 
these laws often impose liability on an entity even if the facility was not owned or operated by the entity 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is defined as net income computed using gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
gains from sales of newly developed properties less accumulated depreciation  if any  required under gaap are included in ffo on the basis that development services are the primary revenue generating activity  we believe that inclusion of these development gains is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo  although others may interpret the definition differently 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations that since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit for the reit industry to address this problem 
we agree with the concept of ffo and believe that ffo is useful to management and investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate properties and excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization  ffo can help one compare our operating performance between periods 
in addition  since most equity reits provide ffo information to the investment community  we believe that ffo is useful to investors as a supplemental measure for comparing our results to those of other equity reits 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
since ffo excludes certain items includable in net income  reliance on the measure has limitations  management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in the balance with other gaap and non gaap measures 
ffo is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs 
additionally  it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service 
the ffo we present may not be comparable to the ffo presented by other reits since they may interpret the current nareit definition of ffo differently or they may not use the current nareit definition of ffo 
basic funds from operations basic ffo is ffo adjusted to subtract preferred share dividends and add back gaap net income allocated to common units in the operating partnership not owned by us 
with these adjustments  basic ffo represents ffo available to common shareholders and common unitholders 
common units in the operating partnership are substantially similar to our common shares and are exchangeable into common shares  subject to certain conditions 
we believe that basic ffo is useful to investors due to the close correlation of common units to common shares 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to basic ffo 
basic ffo has essentially the same limitations as ffo  management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for ffo 
diluted funds from operations diluted ffo is basic ffo adjusted to add back any convertible preferred share dividends and any other changes in basic ffo that would result from the assumed conversion of securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares 
however  the computation of diluted ffo does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted ffo per share in a given period 
we believe that diluted ffo is useful to investors because it is the numerator used to compute diluted ffo per share  discussed below 
in addition  since most equity reits provide diluted ffo information to the investment community  we believe diluted ffo is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other equity reits 
we believe that the numerator for diluted eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to diluted ffo 
since diluted ffo excludes certain items includable in the numerator to diluted eps  reliance on the measure has limitations  management compensates for these limitations by using the measure simply as a supplemental measure that is weighed in the balance with other gaap and non gaap measures 
diluted ffo is not necessarily an indication of our cash flow available to fund cash needs 
additionally  it should not be used as an alternative to net income when evaluating our financial performance or to cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities when evaluating our liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service 
the diluted ffo that we present may not be comparable to the diluted ffo presented by other reits 
diluted funds from operations per share diluted ffo per share is diluted ffo divided by the sum of the a weighted average common shares outstanding during a period  b weighted average common units outstanding during a period and c weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged 
however  the computation of diluted ffo per share does not assume conversion of securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase diluted ffo per share in a given period 
we believe that diluted ffo per share is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating our ffo results in the same manner that investors use earnings per share eps in evaluating net income available to common shareholders 
in addition  since most equity reits provide diluted ffo per share information to the investment community  we believe diluted ffo per share is a useful supplemental measure for comparing us to other equity reits 
we believe that diluted eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to diluted ffo per share 
diluted ffo per share has most of the same limitations as diluted ffo described above  management compensates for these limitations in essentially the same manner as described above for diluted ffo

gains from newly developed or re developed properties less accumulated depreciation  if any  required under gaap are also included in ffo on the basis that development services are the primary revenue generating activity  we believe that inclusion of these development gains is in compliance with the nareit definition of ffo  although others may interpret the definition differently 
inflation we were not significantly affected by inflation during the periods presented in this report due primarily to the relatively low inflation rates in our markets 
most of our tenants are obligated to pay their share of a building s operating expenses to the extent such expenses exceed amounts established in their leases  based on historical expense levels 
in addition  some of our tenants are obligated to pay their full share of a building s operating expenses 
these arrangements somewhat reduce our exposure to increases in such costs resulting from inflation 
our costs associated with constructing buildings and completing renovation and tenant improvement work increased due to higher cost of materials 
we expect to recover a portion of these costs through higher tenant rents and reimbursements for tenant improvements 
the additional costs that we do not recover increase depreciation expense as projects are completed and placed into service

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  the most predominant of which is change in interest rates 
increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our revolving credit facility and our other mortgage loans payable carrying variable interest rate terms 
increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our loans payable carrying fixed interest rate terms mature and need to be refinanced 
our debt strategy favors long term  fixed rate  secured debt over variable rate debt to minimize the risk of short term increases in interest rates 
as of december   of our mortgage and other loans payable balance carried fixed interest rates and of our fixed rate loans were scheduled to mature after as of december   the percentage of variable rate loans relative to total assets was 
the following table sets forth our long term debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity and weighted average interest rates at december  dollars in thousands for the years ended december  thereafter total long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate represents principal maturities only and therefore excludes net premiums and discounts of million 
the fair market value of our mortgage and other loans payable was billion at december  and billion at december  based on our variable rate debt balances  our interest expense would have increased by million in and million in if short term interest rates were higher 
interest expense in was more sensitive to a change in interest rates than due primarily to a higher average variable rate debt balance in
