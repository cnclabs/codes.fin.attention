captaris was incorporated in the state of washington in our principal executive offices are located in bellevue  washington 
we sell  promote and receive referrals for the use of our products primarily through an indirect channel of resellers and distributors  strategic partnerships  oems and private label agreements  as well as through our enterprise sales team and national account managers that hold dedicated business relationships with assigned accounts on the fortune list 
we believe the use of multiple distribution channels that access many of the same potential customers increases the likelihood that our products will be sold to a particular customer 
oem partners market and sell our products and services in conjunction with their own core products and service portfolios  adding more value to their customers with an integrated go to market approach 
in some cases  these oem agreements provide minimum revenue commitments 
executive summary we derive net revenue primarily from licensing software as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and the sale of maintenance and support agreements 
the primary driver of our revenue growth over the prior year was attributable to revenue from our new bid product lines  the document management and workflow product lines 
revenue from our rightfax product line in the year ended december  remained relatively flat compared to the year ended december  due primarily to what we believe to be negative impacts from the changes we introduced into the sales channel in the first quarter of  as we integrated our new document management product line 
we believe that the rightfax product line revenue recovered from these changes during the second half of and expect it to show modest growth in over the year ended december  the rightfax product line represents the majority of our revenue and  while we expect rightfax revenue to increase  we expect higher growth from our bid product lines in the future 
our gross margins for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december   primarily due to increased sales of our new bid product lines which contribute higher gross margins compared to the rightfax product line which contributes lower gross margins as it is bundled with lower margin hardware components 
we anticipate gross profit as a percentage of revenue for will improve over the year ended december due to increased revenue  as a percent of our total revenue  from our new bid product lines 
we experienced a loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the increased loss was primarily attributable to lower than expected revenue 
table of contents captaris  inc 
particularly from our rightfax product line and to an increase in operating expenses resulting primarily from increased staffing and related costs incurred to support our new document management formerly alchemy product line and to the costs associated with the corporate reorganization and non cash impairment charges announced in november as discussed below 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million and million in the years ended and respectively  on loss from continuing operations 
we recognized income tax expense of million on income from continuing operations in the income tax benefits in and included the reversal of tax liabilities of approximately  and million  respectively  primarily associated with the reversal of liabilities which management determined were no longer probable based on updated information surrounding the related tax returns 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments available for sale and long term investments available for sale 
our portfolio consists primarily of money market funds  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and municipal and us government agency backed securities 
consolidated cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  totaled million  down million from december  this decrease was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock and capital purchases 
this decrease in cash was partially offset by net cash flow provided by operations and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options capital expenditures during the year ended december   consisted primarily of technology infrastructure and equipment  as well as leasehold improvements  to support the growth of our core business activities 
other than cisco systems  inc cisco  which represented of net revenue in  no single customer represented more than of our net revenue for the years ended december   and our order fulfillment operations consist primarily of compact disc duplication  documentation fulfillment and distribution of fax boards 
the majority of our products are installed by third parties 
in cases where the customer buys installation services from us  we typically contract with outside vendors to provide full systems integration and assembly 
our rightfax products incorporate a number of commercially available application cards and fax cards that enable integration with certain fax servers 
we currently purchase and resell fax boards from brooktrout  inc  recently acquired by eas group  inc  and eicon networks corporation 
we depend upon these third party manufacturers for fax boards 
if our manufacturers terminate their relationships with us  are unable to fill orders on a timely basis or experience quality performance issues  we may be unable to meet customer demands  which would delay or decrease our revenue or otherwise have an adverse impact on our operations 
our rightfax and document management product lines include third party software for which we pay royalties 
the software from other companies provides generic or non strategic functionality 
our royalty expense was of net revenue in  less than of net revenue in and of revenue in we have extensive service offerings that are sold in conjunction with our products  including maintenance  support  professional services and solutions 
all of these offerings are designed to help customers protect and extend their software investment 
we work with resellers and distributors located throughout the world 
these resellers and distributors sell and install our products and they receive discounts based on the volume of sales 
within our selling and marketing groups  we dedicate significant resources to monitoring our resellers and distributors and to generating demand and providing market positioning and support 
utilizing the indirect channel approach provides several advantages  including minimizing the investment in office facilities and personnel in field locations and applying greater resources to sales and implementation efforts 
however  with a channel sales model  it is more difficult to track the number and locations of all end users utilizing our products 
this also somewhat limits our ability to capture information around product usage  system integration characteristics  and deployment satisfaction directly from the customer s perspective in order to enhance or build new products  solutions and services 
professional services include implementation consulting  training and other service support 
the vast majority of product implementation is performed by our channel partners 
in some instances  customers request high level installation and consulting services directly from us 
in january  we made the decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with our infinite product line directly into our business information delivery products 
accordingly  in january  we made an end of life announcement of our standalone infinite mobile delivery product line 
as a result we deemed that the intangible asset related to the infinite technology trade name was impaired and an impairment charge of approximately  was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents captaris  inc 
on november   we announced a corporate reorganization intended to improve the efficiency and cost structure of our business 
these changes included a reduction in our workforce  the consolidation of office facilities  which included the impairment of furniture and equipment in those office facilities 
the workforce reduction included certain founders of teamplate  who joined the company when we acquired teamplate  inc in september  and triggered the acceleration of the remaining teamplate management incentive plan obligation associated with the acquisition 
we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to this reorganization  of which approximately million was a cash expenditure in that quarter 
the charge was comprised of approximately million of severance and incentive plan payments for the workforce reduction  including million for the teamplate incentive pay obligation  and approximately  for the consolidation of office facilities 
we recorded approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses and  in research and development expenses 
also on november   we announced that we would record a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately  which included a  charge for impairment of application systems software projects that would not be pursued and  of assets  which were abandoned with the office consolidation 
these charges were recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
we do not anticipate future cash expenditures in connection with this impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which will  among other things  require the recording in the financial statements of non cash compensation expense related to stock options 
prior to  the company had only shown  as permitted by sfas no 
 pro forma financial results including the effects of share based compensation expense in the footnotes to the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for these pro forma results related to years   and we have completed a preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting sfas no 
r and estimate that it will result in share based payment expense in the range of approximately  to  for the quarter ending march  and in the range of approximately  to  for the year ending december  the actual effect of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  actual option grant activity and timing  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards and the assumed award forfeiture rate 
acquisitions and divestitures we had no acquisitions or significant divestitures during on october   we acquired information management research  inc imr  an englewood  colorado company 
imr s alchemy product line  which helps organizations capture  archive and retrieve business information enabling us to provide complete solutions for our worldwide enterprise customers 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired imr for a total of million 
we paid million in cash  including transaction costs of approximately million and assumed liabilities of million  net of cash acquired of  the assumed liabilities included million of deferred tax liabilities related to purchased intangibles not deductible for tax purposes  deferred revenue of million and accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million 
the acquisition of imr has been accounted for as a purchase 
on the acquisition date  million of the purchase price was deposited in a third party escrow account for two years as security for certain post closing obligations of the imr shareholders  including indemnification obligations 
in connection with the acquisition we adopted a plan to consolidate all imr finance and administrative functions to our bellevue headquarters 
as such  as part of the purchase price allocation  we recorded a liability of  for severance expenses related to the involuntary termination of fourteen imr employees 
we acquired teamplate  inc teamplate on september  to expand our business information delivery product offerings as an extension and complement to our existing rightfax product line and to further penetrate the business process automation market workflow 
in connection with the acquisition  we executed an incentive plan that allowed the teamplate management team to earn a minimum of million and up to million over the thirteen quarters following the acquisition  subject to their continued employment and our success in achieving certain revenue performance targets 
in november  we announced a reduction in staff  which included certain founders of teamplate and triggered the acceleration of our remaining minimum incentive plan obligation 
we recorded a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  related to this incentive program and  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our callxpress product line historically had significantly lower margins than our rightfax products and sales of callxpress continued to decline over time  which reflected the depressed market for most telephony products 
in july of  we announced our intent to sell our callxpress voice mail and unified messaging product line 
this announcement prompted some prospective customers 
table of contents captaris  inc 
to delay buying decisions  which caused a further decline in callxpress sales 
on september   we sold the callxpress product line for million to applied voice and speech technologies  inc avst 
since many activities related to callxpress were shared with the rightfax product line  the callxpress product line results  including the gain on disposition  are included in our results from continuing operations 
at the time of the transaction  we recorded restructuring costs of  primarily associated with terminating employees not retained by avst 
concurrent with the transaction  we entered into an earn out agreement with avst which entitles us to receive additional payments of up to million per year for each of the three years following the sale  depending on avst s success in achieving certain revenue targets 
this gain was classified on our income statements as a reduction to operating expenses in each of the years received 
on march   we received a report from avst  and payment of million  confirming achievement of the revenue target for in february of we received notification confirming that avst had achieved their revenue target for we received a payment of million in march of and accordingly  in the first quarter of  we recorded an additional gain on the sale of the callxpress product line within operating expenses 
concurrent with our decision to divest the callxpress product line  we began negotiating an acceleration and conclusion of an oem agreement with cisco 
in october of  we reached an agreement with cisco and accordingly  cisco paid us million as payment in full for all remaining unpaid aggregate license fees  plus an additional hours of support and training services for a period not exceeding months  valued at  as a result of this agreement  million was recorded as license revenue in the fourth quarter of training revenue related to this oem agreement was recognized when the service was rendered in support revenue was recognized ratably from october of through the first nine months of as of december   all the revenue related to the support and training was recognized 
we sold the assets of mediatel corporation mediatel  our wholly owned subsidiary that operated the medialinq business  our outsource e document services division  on september  for million in cash to xpedite systems  inc xpedite  a division of ptek holdings  inc 
ptek 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  mediatel s results of operations  net of income taxes  have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
concurrent with this transaction  we entered into license and reseller agreements with xpedite  under which we licensed our fax to mail technology to xpedite over a three year period following the sale for a minimum aggregate license fee of million 
in  we recognized  of revenue in connection with these agreements 
we did not record any revenue in relating to the license agreement due to a dispute with xpedite relating to the outstanding minimum licenses fee 
in february  we resolved the dispute regarding the revenue relating to and stipulated to entry of judgment in favor of captaris on all claims 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we expect to record an additional  of revenue related to the commitment and in the third quarter of we expect to record another million of revenue in accordance with the license agreement 
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our presentation of our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates used  including those related to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  useful lives of intangible assets and equipment and leasehold improvements  inventory valuation allowances  revenue recognition  the estimated allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts and income tax accruals 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting judgments and estimates relate to the following areas revenue recognition  allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value  classification of investments and assessment of related unrealized losses  valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets

revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies follow the guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we sell products through resellers  original equipment manufacturers oem s and other channel partners  as well as directly to end users 
generally our resellers do not stock product  and except for oem sales described below  we recognize product revenue upon shipment  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
all software licenses are bundled with days of telephone support 
we consider revenue associated with this telephone support to be insignificant  and therefore  we recognize this revenue when the software is shipped and record an estimate for the related cost of the telephone support 
revenue from term software licenses is recognized over the term of the license  generally twelve months 
whenever a software license  hardware  installation and post contract customer support or pcs elements are sold together  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each element based on its respective fair value  which is the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the amount of revenue assigned to each element is impacted by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vsoe for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition for these items 
revenue for pcs is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  ranging from one to five years 
pcs includes rights to unspecified upgrades and updates  when and if available  and bug fixes 
installation revenue is recognized when the product has been installed at the customer s site and accepted by the customer 
recognition of revenue from software sold with installation services is recognized either when the software is shipped or when the installation services are completed  depending on our agreement with the customer and whether the installation services are integral to the functionality of the software 
revenue from perpetual software licenses is recognized when the software has been shipped  provided that collection for such revenue is deemed probable 
for software sold to resellers in which we have granted exchange rights  we defer the revenue until the reseller sells the software through to end users 
we have entered into agreements with certain oems from which we receive royalty payments periodically 
under the terms of the oem license agreements  each oem will qualify our software on their hardware and software configurations 
once the software has been qualified  the oem will begin to ship products and report net sales to us 
most oems pay a license fee based on the number of copies of licensed software included in the products sold to their customers 
these oems pay fees on a per unit basis and we record associated revenue when we receive notification of the oems sales of the licensed software to an end user 
the terms of the license agreements generally require the oems to notify us of sales of our products within to days after the end of the month or quarter in which the sales occur 
as a result  we recognize the revenue in the month or quarter following the sales of the product to these oems customers 
in general  customers are granted a day right of return for product sales 
we reduce revenue recognized for estimated product returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
if we cannot reasonably estimate returns we defer the revenue until the return rights lapse 
when customer acceptance provisions are present and we cannot reasonably estimate returns  we recognize revenue upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
consulting services are customarily billed at fixed rates  plus out of pocket expenses and revenues are recognized when the consulting has been completed 
however  if it is determined that a consulting engagement will be unprofitable  we recognize the loss at the time of such determination 
training revenue is recognized when the training is completed 
allowance for sales return 
we estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue based on our historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
we periodically review the adequacy of our sales returns allowance and underlying assumptions 
if the assumptions we use to calculate the estimated sales returns do not properly reflect future returns  a change in accruals for sales returns would be made in the period in which such a determination was made 
historically  our accruals for sales returns have been adequate 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make ongoing assumptions as to the collectibility of our accounts receivable in our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make estimates based on our historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
our reserves historically have been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  if actual credit losses were to fluctuate significantly from the reserves we have established  our general and administrative expenses could be adversely affected 

table of contents captaris  inc 
valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value 
due to rapid changes in technology  it is possible that older products in inventory may become obsolete or that we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that the carrying value of inventories is not recoverable  we write down inventories to market value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  inventory write downs may be required  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
classification of investments and assessment of related unrealized losses 
we classify our short term and long term investments as available for sale 
our portfolio consists primarily of money market funds  adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  municipal and us government agency backed securities and is recorded at fair market value 
we determine the fair value of our investments based on quoted market prices 
investments with expected maturities of one year or less are classified as short term 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
we believe that the expected lives of our mortgage backed securities investments are much shorter than the stated maturities due to mortgage refinances and sales of homes 
accordingly  we have estimated the portion of the mortgages likely to be prepaid within one year based on historical prepayment data  current interest rates and other economic factors  and classified a portion of these investments as short term 
unrealized gains and losses  net of any income tax effect  are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate  with the associated premium or discount amortized to interest income over the term of the investment 
we recognize an impairment charge for unrealized losses when an investment s decline in fair value is below the cost basis and is judged to be other than temporary 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial condition and near term business outlook for the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
valuation of acquired businesses  assets and liabilities 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of december  our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million 
the determination of the fair value of such intangible assets and goodwill is a critical and complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions and estimates are based on our best judgments and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the first quarter of the year  and on an interim basis in certain circumstances 
we conducted our annual assessment during the first quarter of and determined our goodwill at march   was not impaired 
no conditions or events have occurred during which would require us to update the assessment 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators include our assessment of the impacts of legal factors  market and economic conditions  the results of our operational performance and strategic plans  competition and market share  and any potential for the sale or disposal of a significant portion of our principal operations 
if we conclude that indicators of impairment exist  we then assess the fair value of goodwill 
the valuation process provides an estimate of a fair value of goodwill using a discounted cash flow model and includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down goodwill to its determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
on november   we announced a corporate reorganization that included the layoff of certain teamplate founders and triggered the acceleration of the remaining teamplate management incentive plan obligation 
during this time we also assessed the effect this layoff had on the valuation of the goodwill recorded with the teamplate acquisition 
it was determined that the goodwill was not impaired as a result of this layoff 
impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements  long lived assets and other intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other intangibles and product lines that we are more likely than not to sell or otherwise dispose of before the end of the asset s previously estimated useful life to determine if there is any impairment of these assets 
we assess the impairment of these assets  or the need to accelerate amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our long lived assets and other intangibles 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the assets should be reviewed to determine their fair value 
we assess the assets for impairment based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded for the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on a valuation process that provides an estimate of a fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model  which includes many assumptions and estimates 
once the valuation is determined  we will write down these assets to their determined fair value  if necessary 
any write down could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

in january  we made the decision to incorporate the mobility technology associated with our infinite product line directly into our business information delivery products 
accordingly  in january  we made an end of life announcement of our standalone infinite mobile delivery product line 
as a result we deemed that the intangible asset related to the infinite technology trade name was impaired and an impairment charge of approximately  was recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense in december on november   we announced a corporate reorganization that included the layoff of certain teamplate founders and triggered the acceleration of the remaining teamplate management incentive plan obligation 
during this time we also assessed the effect this layoff had on the valuation of the intangibles related to the teamplate acquisition 
we determined that the intangibles were not impaired as a result of this layoff 
concurrent with the announcement of the reorganization  we announced that we would record a non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of this impairment charge of approximately  included  of impairment of application systems software projects that would no longer be pursued and  of assets which were abandoned with the office consolidation 
we do not anticipate future cash expenditures in connection with this impairment 
useful lives of equipment  leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
equipment and leasehold improvements  identifiable intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized over their useful lives on a straight line basis 
useful lives for equipment and leasehold improvements are based on our estimates of the period that the equipment or leasehold improvement will be used  which typically range from two to five years 
useful lives for intangible assets are based on our estimates of the period that the intangible assets will generate cash 
changes in estimated useful lives could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
contingencies 
we are periodically involved in litigation or claims  including patent infringement claims  in the normal course of our business 
we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  to record litigation or claim related expenses 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
we accrue for settlements when the outcome is probable and the amount or range of the settlement can be reasonably estimated 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding litigation and claims that could result in actual settlement amounts that differ materially from estimates 
we expense our legal costs associated with these matters when incurred 
accounting for income taxes 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  we are required to estimate our potential income tax claims in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and in determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish accruals for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes  penalties and interest will be due 
these accruals are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we will establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to allow for the realization of our deferred net tax assets 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals and valuation allowances that we consider appropriate  as well as the related penalties and interest expense 
in addition to our judgments and use of estimates  there are inherent uncertainties surrounding income taxes that could result in actual amounts that differ materially from our estimates 
any adjustments in our tax provision related to these contingencies could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow

consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges stock based compensation expense benefit gain on sale of discontinued callxpress product line total operating expenses operating income loss other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income loss net revenue we derive net revenue primarily from licensing software as well as follow on sales of add on software modules and the sale of maintenance and support agreements 
we continue to distribute fax boards with a significant number of our software product sales for which we receive a margin significantly less than the margin on our software products 
percent change from percent change from in thousands net revenue rightfax product line bid product line cisco oem agreement callxpress product line net revenue years ended december  and the increase in net revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to revenue from our new bid product lines  the document management and workflow product lines 
we acquired the document management product line in october and the workflow product line in september revenue from our new bid product lines increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to the inclusion of twelve months of sales from our document management product line in compared to two months in and growth of our workflow product line 
revenue from our rightfax product line in the year ended december  remained relatively flat compared to the year ended december  rightfax product revenue  which includes revenue from software licenses and hardware sales  was million for the year ended december   down from the year ended rightfax maintenance  support and services revenue was million for the year ended december   up million or from the year ended december  
table of contents captaris  inc 
we believe that revenue from the rightfax product line was negatively impacted in the first half of from changes we introduced into the sales channel in the first quarter of we acquired the document management product line from imr in the fourth quarter of and postponed integrating revenue operations until after the first of the year  which is typically our slowest sales quarter 
in the first half of  we believe many of our traditional rightfax resellers increased their emphasis on the new bid product lines as we integrated the document management product line 
other changes included new technology in our rightfax product  reassignment in field support and emphasis on multi product solution selling 
we believe these changes temporarily negatively impacted revenue from the rightfax product line  as the resellers focused on training and integrating the new products into their product lines 
we anticipated training and similar transitional activities with our partners  however  we believe these activities took longer and had a greater impact on rightfax product revenue than we expected 
we believe that the rightfax product line revenue recovered from these changes during the second half of and expect to show modest growth over the year ended december  international net revenue represented approximately of total net revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  international revenue from our rightfax product line represented approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  the overall increase in revenue from our international regions was due to our continued investment and expansion into international markets and to a higher distribution of sales outside north america from our document management product line 
we expect the portion of our revenue derived from international markets to remain relatively consistent in we anticipate that consolidated net revenue will grow modestly in compared to the rightfax product line represents the majority of our revenue and  while we expect rightfax revenue to increase  we expect higher growth from our bid product lines 
historically  our business experiences seasonality with a decline in revenue during the first quarter compared to the prior year s fourth quarter  building gradually during the second and third quarters  and ending with the fourth quarter as our largest quarter for revenue 
we anticipate this pattern to continue in years ended december  and the decrease in net revenue in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the fact that fiscal included million of revenue from the acceleration of an oem agreement with cisco and million of revenue from our callxpress product line which we divested in september excluding the effect of this oem agreement and callxpress revenue in  net revenue for the year ended december  increased approximately 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in revenue from the rightfax product line  an increase of million from the workflow product line formally teamplate and million from the document management product line  which we acquired on october  the increase in rightfax revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of maintenance and support contracts sold as a result of our decision in february to begin requiring first year maintenance with our software licenses

previously unvested options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock became immediately exercisable 
the board also imposed a holding period that will require all executive officers and certain other members of senior management to refrain from selling shares acquired upon the exercise of these options  other than shares needed to cover the exercise price and to satisfy withholding taxes and shares transferred by will or by the applicable laws of descent and distribution  until the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option s original vesting terms 
the accelerated vesting will eliminate future compensation expenses that we would otherwise recognize in our financial statements with respect to these options upon implementation of sfas no

in accordance with apb no

 no compensation expense was recorded within the financial statements as a result of this modification because the options had an intrinsic value of on the date of the modification due to the exercise price being in excess of the current market price of the stock

other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of investment income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
for the years ended december   and  other income was   and million  respectively 
the decrease in net other income was due primarily to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decrease in our invested cash balances 
our invested cash balances decreased over due primarily to cash used to repurchase our common stock and to purchase capital assets 
the cash balances have decreased significantly from primarily due to our use of cash to acquire imr in october and to repurchase and redeem our common stock in and assuming interest rates remain at recent levels  we expect interest income to remain relatively consistent with income tax expense benefit we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish accruals for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes  penalties and interest will be due 
these accruals are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of potential tax claims and changes to accruals that we consider appropriate  as well as the related penalties and interest

at december   we have available unused net operating losses that may be applied against future taxable income of million 
these net operating losses consist of international losses of million that do not expire  federal losses of million that expire from to  and state losses of million that expire from to we believe that there is sufficient positive evidence to support our conclusion not to record a valuation allowance against these net operating losses 
we believe that we will utilize the loss carry forwards in the future because we have had a history of pre tax income and we are implementing plans to generate profits in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that we believe will enable us to utilize the unused international net operating losses in a timely manner 
in addition  the internal revenue code irc section limitation for the acquired net operating loss of imr of million covers approximately five years of future operations  which is well within the statute of limitations for these losses

this decrease in cash was partially offset by net cash provided by operations of million and proceeds of  from the exercise of employee stock options

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of the our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting primarily of investment grade interest bearing securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the interest bearing securities in our portfolio are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately  because we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  we do not expect our operating results  financial condition or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency risk currently  substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
we price certain international sales to the united kingdom in british pounds sterling  to canada in canadian dollars  to australia in australian dollars and to participating european community countries in euros 
increases in the value of the dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international operations  we expect our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions to increase 
we do not currently engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of currency fluctuations  but we may do so in the future 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency translation fluctuations associated with our assets and liabilities denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  euros and british pounds sterling 
the objective in managing these foreign currency translation exposures is to minimize the risk through minimizing the level of activity and financial instruments denominated in those currencies 
our foreign currency financial instruments primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  trade payables  accrued expenses and intercompany loans 
for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net asset position  a strengthening us dollar would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  for an entity with various financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency in a net liability position  a weakening in the us dollar would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
historically  we have not hedged our translation risks on these currencies 
we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates would have a material impact on future results of operations or cash flow 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the underlying foreign currency exposures described above 
the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a  loss in fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december
