item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific segment of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  on board computers  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  and other air conditioning and heating parts 
we sell our products primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
we also sell our products in europe through our european segment 
as part of our efforts to grow our business  as well as to achieve increased production and distribution efficiencies  on june  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of dana corporation s engine management group subsequently referred to as dem 
our plan was to restructure and to integrate the dem business into our existing engine management business  which we have essentially completed 
we continue to review our operations and implement plans to continue to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies 
under the terms of the acquisition  we paid dana corporation million in cash  issued an unsecured promissory note of million  and issued  shares of our common stock valued at million 
including transaction costs  our total purchase price was approximately million 
on december   we entered into a repurchase and prepayment agreement with dana  in which we repurchased the  shares of our common stock at a repurchase price of per share or an aggregate approximate repurchase price of million and prepaid at a discount the million unsecured promissory note plus accrued and unpaid interest for an aggregate approximate amount of million 
we recognized the discount of million as a gain on the repayment of the note as well as the unrecognized deferred interest expense thereon of million as income in in connection with the dem acquisition  we have reviewed our operations and implemented integration plans to restructure the operations of dem 
as part of the integration and restructuring plans  we closed seven of the nine acquired dem facilities 
we have currently estimated total restructuring costs of million  which was reduced by million from the prior year due to lower actual costs 
such amounts were recognized as liabilities assumed in the acquisition and included in the allocation of the cost to acquire dem 
the reduction of million has been applied as a reduction of goodwill established on the acquisition of dem 
based on our most recent estimates of the total restructuring costs  approximately million relates to work force reductions and employee termination benefits 
this amount primarily represents severance costs relating to the involuntary termination of dem employees individually employed throughout dem facilities across a broad range of functions  including managerial  professional  clerical  manufacturing and factory positions 
as of december   the remaining reserve balance was million 
we expect to pay most of this amount for work force reductions in and termination benefits of million and million were paid in and  respectively 
the restructuring costs also included approximately million associated with exiting certain activities  primarily related to lease and contract termination costs 
exit costs of million and million were paid in and  respectively  leaving the exit reserve balance at million as of december for additional information about our business  strategy and competitive environment  see item  business 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
the seasonality of our business offers significant operational challenges in our manufacturing and distribution functions 
to limit these challenges and to provide a rapid turnaround time of customer orders  we traditionally offer a pre season selling program  known as our spring promotion  in which customers are offered a choice of a price discount or longer payment terms 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
the company accrues for overstock returns as a percentage of sales  after giving consideration to recent returns history 
in addition  the seasonality of our temperature control segment requires that we increase our inventory during the winter season in preparation of the summer selling season and customers purchasing such inventory have the right to make returns 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  beginning in we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not follow a twelve step warranty return process 
discounts  allowances and incentives 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer a variety of usual customer discounts  allowances and incentives 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discounted terms of the invoice 
historical experience is analyzed on a timely basis and is applied as a reduction of sales 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
these discounts are principally in the form of off invoice discounts and are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale 
for those customers that choose to receive a payment on a quarterly basis instead of off invoice  we accrue for such payments as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly 
finally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances  and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
we account for these discounts and allowances as a reduction to revenues  and record them when sales are recorded 
comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily in our temperature control segment which was driven by a very hot summer  with our europe segment and canadian business experiencing increases as well 
our engine management segment net sales  however  decreased by million or as compared to partly due to price decreases initiated early in to match oe competitor prices and negative trends in product mix and distribution channel mix 
gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased to in compared to in the margin decrease was primarily attributable to the engine management segment where the margin declined to from in the prior year 
the margin in engine management was negatively impacted due to price decreases initiated early in to match oe competitor prices as well as inventory write downs related to the integration of dem inventories and negative trends in product and distribution channel mix 
we expect engine management margins to improve going forward due to the benefit of price increases already implemented at the end of and into early and improved material costs and other operational improvements 
in our temperature control segment  margins increased to from in the prior year due to increased sales volumes which improved cost utilization  and lower sourced material costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased by million to million in  compared to million in this reduction was primarily due to integration related savings in our engine management segment  namely for distribution expenses which declined million following the rationalization of the acquired dem facilities 
in  we also made substantial changes to our retiree medical program  which resulted in a reduction of million to fas post retirement expenses  which included a million curtailment gain 
in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pension  we recognized a curtailment gain of million for the post retirement plans related to changes made to our plan namely regarding limiting eligibility 
the curtailment accounting requires us to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the changes 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses decreased to in from in goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but  instead  is subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of december  and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
goodwill related to the dem acquisition was reduced in line with our reduction to the dem restructuring accrual reduction due to an improvement to our estimate of severance costs to be paid 
our annual impairment test of goodwill as of december  indicated that the carrying amounts of two of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding fair values  which were determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the reporting units  the company s weighted average cost of capital and market multiples 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of million during the fourth quarter of the impairment loss related to our temperature control and european segments for which we recorded a charge of million and million  respectively 
as of december   there only remained goodwill in our engine management segment 
we will continue to test for impairment of our goodwill at least annually in the future 
restructuring expenses 
restructuring includes restructuring and integration expenses 
restructuring and integration expenses in were million  with million for restructuring and million for integration  compared to million in which related entirely to restructuring expenses 
of the integration expenses in  million was primarily for non cash charges from an asset impairment in our temperature control business related to a strategic decision to outsource certain products that we previously manufactured 
the restructuring expense of million in primarily relates to the dem restructuring  for which we incurred million in the dem integration is essentially complete 
however  we continue to rationalize our capacity to further reduce our production costs 
operating income loss 
operating income increased by million to million in  compared to an operating loss of million in the increase was due to higher sales and expense reductions primarily from the sfas curtailment gain  reduction in restructuring charges and no goodwill impairment expense in  partly offset by lower gross margins 
other income  net 
other income  net decreased by million to million in  compared to million in the decrease was due in part to exchange losses related to the canadian dollar offset in part by the recognition of the discount of million as a gain on the repayment of the promissory note held by dana corporation as well as the unrecognized deferred interest expense thereon of million in interest expense 
interest expense increased by million to million in compared to million in due to higher borrowings and higher average borrowing rates 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision was million in compared to a recovery of million in the increase in the provision was due to reduced consolidated losses  a decrease to the state tax rate applicable to deferred tax assets  as well as an increase to the valuation allowance to account for the uncertainty regarding the ultimate utilization of the company s us capital loss  us foreign tax credit carryovers  state tax carryovers  foreign net operating loss carry forwards  and certain long lived deferred tax assets stemming mainly from accrued asbestos liabilities and post retirement benefit obligations 
the increase was partially offset by taxes on the canadian deemed dividend  which did not reoccur in our foreign income tax relates primarily to our profitable canadian and hong kong operations 
deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of million and deferred tax credits of million were million as of december  approximately million of taxable income will need to be generated to realize the deferred tax asset 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate this level of taxable income within years based on the following assumptions that our puerto rico profits will create us taxable income following the expiration of section of the internal revenue code and that our us based engine management segment will gradually return to the levels of profitability enjoyed prior to the dem acquisition 
our us net operating losses carried forward of million expire between and  and we also have alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for which there is no expiration date 
all other tax attributes have no carry forward limitation 
loss from discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation  net of taxes  in reflects million associated with asbestos related legal expenses as compared to million in which included a future litigation claim provision in addition to legal expenses 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  effective october  we reflected new customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
in  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the amount as if the change in accounting principle had taken effect on october  comparison of fiscal years and sales 
on a consolidated basis  net sales for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million in the increase in net sales was primarily in our engine management segment and our canadian distribution business 
engine management net sales increased to million an increase of million or in as compared to the acquisition of dem added approximately million of incremental net sales in the first half of with no sales in the comparable period in excluding the impact of the first half dem net sales  the balance of engine management sales increased million or 
the million increase in sales in our canadian business was related to the acquisition of the dem distribution business in february temperature control net sales decreased to million a decrease of million or in as compared to the decrease in temperature control net sales was primarily due to the very cool and wet weather conditions existing in the spring and early summer 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was a preferable accounting method to reflect new customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred instead of as we initially recorded it as a prepaid asset and the related expense which was recognized ratably over a month period as an offset to sales 
accordingly  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the accounting change as if it had taken effect on october  gross margins 
gross margins  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  decreased to in compared to in the margin decrease was primarily related to a number of significant one time related items from the final dem integration and lower net sales in our temperature control segment 
the engine management gross margins were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of primarily related to the underabsorption of factory overhead expenses of approximately million due to closing manufacturing facilities for physical inventories and to reduce the bridge inventories which had been built to cover the plant closings  unfavorable physical inventory adjustments of approximately million primarily related to the scrapping of inventories in facilities being closed  and an inventory writedown of approximately million related to the inventory turnover for products sourced on the outside at substantial premiums to our manufactured costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased by million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the million sales increase  as discussed above  and an increase of million in discount fees associated with the sale of customer receivables see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in we anticipate further savings in as we have completed the dem integration and merged operations 
goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but  instead  is subject to an annual review for potential impairment 
our annual impairment test of goodwill as of december   indicated that the carrying amounts of two of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding fair values  which were determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows of the reporting units  the companies weighted average cost of capital and market multiples 
as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of million during the fourth quarter of the impairment loss related to our temperature control and european segment for which we recorded a charge of million and million  respectively 
restructuring expenses 
restructuring expenses in were million  primarily related to the dem integration  compared to million in  which primarily related to expenses associated with the dem integration and with the divestiture of a product line within our european segment 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased by million to an operating loss of million in  compared to operating income of million in the decrease was primarily due to fourth quarter charges impacting the engine management gross margin  lower temperature control sales  goodwill impairment charge and dem integration expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net  increased to million in compared to an expense of million in the increase was primarily due to increased earnings from joint ventures and foreign exchange transactions 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million in compared to million in income tax provision 
the effective tax rate for continuing operations decreased from in to in the effective rate was impacted by various tax jurisdictions we do business in and no tax benefits recorded on losses in europe 
loss from discontinued operation 
loss from discontinued operation  net of taxes  in reflects million associated with asbestos related provisions and legal expenses as compared to million of legal expenses in as discussed more fully in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
as discussed above  we reflect new customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the amount as if the change in accounting principle had taken effect on october  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
impact of inflation although inflation is a concern  management believes it will be able to continue to minimize any adverse effect of inflation on earnings through cost reduction programs  including the sale of manufactured products  and  where competitive situations permit  selling price increases 
recently  prices of steel and other commodities have risen 
these increases did not have a material impact on our consolidated results  as we are not dependent on any single commodity  however  there can be no assurance over the long term that increases in commodity prices will not materially effect our business or results of operations 
future results of operations we continue to face competitive pressures 
in order to sell at competitive prices while maintaining profit margins  we are continuing to focus on overhead and cost reductions 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities amounted to million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in the cash decrease in was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable partly offset by a decrease in inventories and lower losses from continuing operations 
the increase in receivables is primarily due to our decision to exit an accounts receivable draft program  which allowed the early monetizing of negotiable drafts  at a discount which was recorded as sg a expenses 
the reduction in was primarily attributable to lower earnings from continuing operations and restructuring charges incurred offset by a decrease in accounts receivable  as compared to for the year ended december   net inventory decreased by approximately million 
inventory turnover was x in  x in  and x in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the decrease is primarily due to the payments related to the dem acquisition in previous years 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to the payment for the acquisition of dem on june  during  payments for acquisitions include dem in canada and the final cash payment for the dem acquisition 
capital expenditures for the three most recent fiscal years ended december totaled million in  million in  and million in financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   million for and million in the increase in was primarily attributable to increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility  part of which was used to fund the repurchase of our common stock and the prepayment of a promissory note held by dana corporation 
the decrease in was primarily due to the financing related to the acquisition of dem on june  effective april   we entered into an agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
the term of the credit agreement was for a period of five years and provided for a line of credit up to million 
effective june   in connection with our acquisition of dem  we amended and restated our credit agreement with general electric capital corporation to provide for an additional million commitment 
this additional commitment increases the total amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility to million from million  and extends the term of the credit agreement from to availability under our revolving credit facility is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets 
we expect such availability under the revolving credit facility to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and integration costs 
our credit agreement also permits dividends and distributions by us provided specific conditions are met 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness and approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
direct borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement or the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement  at our option 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of our domestic and canadian subsidiaries 
the terms of our revolving credit facility provide for  among other provisions  financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months through  and to limit capital expenditure levels for each fiscal year through at march   we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio contained in our revolving credit facility and  at september   we were not in compliance with a covenant contained in our revolving credit facility relating to the limitation on redemption of drafts prior to the maturity date thereof under our customer draft programs 
we received waivers of compliance of such covenants for the applicable periods 
during  we amended our revolving credit facility on three occasions to provide  among other things  for the following borrowings of the company are no longer collateralized by the assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  of our canadian subsidiary  the specified levels of fixed charge coverage has been modified for and thereafter  our canadian subsidiary was released from its obligations under a guaranty and security agreement  the company s pledge of stock of its canadian subsidiary to the lenders was reduced from a to a pledge of stock  the removal of the limit on our ability to redeem the current drafts prior to the maturity date  and the prohibition of accepting drafts under our customer draft programs after november  in december  we further amended our revolving credit facility to provide  among other things  for the following the lenders consent to the company s repurchase of shares of company common stock held by dana corporation and the company s prepayment of an unsecured promissory note held by dana  the lenders consent for a million term loan issued to the company s canadian subsidiary by affiliates of the lenders  and the extension of the termination date of our revolving credit facility from february  to december  in december  our canadian subsidiary entered into a credit agreement with ge canada finance holding company  for itself and as agent for the lenders  and gecc capital markets  inc  as lead arranger and book runner 
the credit agreement provides for  among other things  a million term loan  which term loan is guaranteed and secured by us and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries and which term loan is coterminous with the term of our revolving credit facility 
the million term loan is part of the million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  in order to facilitate the aggregate financing of the dem acquisition in june  we completed a public equity offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million and also issued to dana corporation  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
in connection with our acquisition of dem  on june  we also issued to dana corporation an unsecured subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million 
the promissory note bears an interest rate of per annum for the first year  with such interest rate increasing by one half of a percentage point on each anniversary of the date of issuance 
accrued and unpaid interest is due quarterly under the promissory note 
the maturity date of the promissory note was december  on december   we entered an agreement with dana  in which we repurchased the  shares of our common stock at a repurchase price of per share or an aggregate approximate repurchase price of million and prepaid at a discount the million unsecured promissory note plus accrued and unpaid interest for an aggregate approximate amount of million 
on june   we borrowed million under a mortgage loan agreement 
the loan is payable in equal monthly installments 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of maturing in july the mortgage loan is secured by the related building and property 
our profitability and working capital requirements are seasonal due to the sales mix of temperature control products 
our working capital requirements usually peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales begin to be received 
these increased working capital requirements are funded by borrowings from our lines of credit 
in and the first quarter of  we also received the benefit from accelerating accounts receivable collections from customer draft programs 
however  in the second quarter of we reduced the early monetizing of these accounts receivable under the draft program 
as mentioned above  an amendment to our revolving credit facility in november now enables us to monetize the remaining drafts but prohibits us from accepting drafts under our customer draft programs after november  we anticipate that our present sources of funds will continue to be adequate to meet our near term needs 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in october under this agreement  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
on july   we issued convertible debentures  payable semi annually  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the debentures carry an interest rate of  payable semi annually 
the debentures are convertible into  shares of our common stock  and mature on july  the proceeds from the sale of the debentures were used to prepay an senior note  reduce short term bank borrowings and repurchase a portion of our common stock 
as of december   we have board authorization to repurchase additional shares at a maximum cost of million 
during  other than the repurchase of our common stock held by dana as discussed above  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock either in the open market or otherwise 
the following is a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total principal payments of long term debt    operating leases        interest rate swap agreements post employee retirement benefits       severance payments related to integration total commitments        critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for some of our sales of remanufactured products  we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities 
such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability 
the liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is generally determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
we use cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors 
the production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores  which we acquire either in outright purchases from used parts brokers  or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers 
under such exchange programs  we reduce our inventory  through a charge to cost of sales  when we sell a finished good compressor  and put back to inventory at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales the used core exchanged when it is actually received from the customer 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs were initially recorded as a prepaid asset and the related expense was recognized ratably over a month period beginning in the month following the stocklift as an offset to sales 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was a preferable accounting method to reflect the customer acquisition costs as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
in  we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for new customer acquisition costs totaling million or million  net of tax effects and recorded the amount as if the change in accounting principle had taken effect on october  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
with respect to goodwill  if necessary  we test for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of each year as part of our annual budgeting process 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
retirement and post retirement medical benefits 
each year  we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are disclosed in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these assumptions are the eligibility criteria of participants  the discount rate used to value the future obligation  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
we select discount rates commensurate with current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
the medical cost trend rate is based on our actual medical claims and future projections of medical cost trends 
under fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  the company has concluded that its post retirement plan is actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit and accordingly recognizes subsidies from the federal government in the measurement of the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation under sfas  employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  in september we recognized a curtailment gain of million for our post retirement plan related to changes made to our plan  namely reducing the number of participants eligible for our plan by making all active participants hired after no longer eligible 
the curtailment accounting requires us to recognize immediately a pro rata portion of the unrecognized prior service cost as a result of the changes 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
a september actuarial study estimated a liability for settlement payments ranging from million to million 
we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we update the actuarial study during the third quarter of each year 
the most recent update to the actuarial study was performed as of august  using methodologies consistent with the september study 
the updated study has estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs  ranging from to million for the period through the change from the prior year study was a million decrease for the low end of the range and a million decrease for the high end of the range 
although there was a decline in the range of liability  given the relative volatility of the actuarial evaluations over the prior three years  we decided to maintain the reserve of million until more experience is gained 
legal costs are estimated to range from to million during the same period 
we plan on performing a similar actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
legal expenses associated with asbestos related matters are expensed as incurred and recorded as a loss from discontinued operation in the statement of operations 
other loss reserves 
we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting pronouncements medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the medicare reform act was signed into law 
in connection with the medicare reform act  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fsp no 
fas fsp no 
fas provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new medicare prescription drug legislation for employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under medicare part d and are therefore entitled to receive subsidies from the federal government beginning in the fsp was adopted for periods beginning after july  under the fsp  if a company concludes that its defined benefit post retirement benefit plan is actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit  the employer should recognize subsidies from the federal government in the measurement of the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation apbo under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
the resulting reduction of the apbo should be accounted for as an actuarial gain 
on january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms released final regulations implementing major provisions of the medicare reform act of the regulations address key concepts  such as defining a plan  as well as the actuarial equivalence test for purposes of obtaining a government subsidy 
pursuant to the guidance in fsp no 
fas  we have assessed the financial impact of the regulations and concluded that our post retirement benefit plan will qualify for the direct subsidies and that our apbo decreased by million 
as a result  our post retirement benefit cost decreased by million 
the impact of the medicare reform act on our post retirement plan was compounded by changes made during the year in the modalities of the plan  namely regarding increased participant contributions and reduced eligibility 
prior to these changes  the impact of the medicare reform act had been estimated to be immaterial and therefore not included in previous actuarial evaluations 
share based payment in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service  the requisite service period usually the vesting period  in exchange for the award 
sfas r is effective for interim and annual financial statements for years beginning after december  and will apply to all outstanding and unvested share based payments at the time of adoption 
also  in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas r 
sab contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
we have adopted sfas r effective january  using the black scholes option pricing model under the modified prospective application method 
under this method  sfas r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the fair value at the date of grant of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
we do not expect that the initial adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and loss earnings per share as we expect that it will impact our financial results in a manner similar to our pro forma disclosure in note to the notes of our consolidated financial statements

the provisions of fas are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of the provisions of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
accounting for uncertain tax positions in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft of the proposed interpretation  accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the proposed interpretation would clarify criterion to be used in the recognition of uncertain tax positions in an enterprise s financial statements 
the company is evaluating the proposed interpretation but does not believe it would materially change the way our company evaluates tax positions for recognition 
the fasb expects to issue the final interpretation in the first half of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro  the japanese yen and the hong kong dollar 
based on our net losses in  the portion of our consolidated results which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in both of the exchange rates affecting both of the foreign currencies in which the indebtedness and the financial instruments described above are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in october under this agreement  we receive a floating rate based on the libor interest rate  and pay a fixed rate of on the notional amount of million 
if  at any time  the swap is determined to be ineffective  in whole or in part  due to changes in the interest rate swap agreement  the fair value of the portion of the interest rate swap determined to be ineffective will be recognized as gain or loss in the statement of operations for the applicable period 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was and at december  and  respectively 
depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have approximately million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
