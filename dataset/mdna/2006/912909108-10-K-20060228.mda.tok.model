raw materials and energy historically  supplies of raw materials and energy used to produce steel were more than sufficient and costs were relatively stable 
in the past several years there has been a tightening of raw material availability and substantial increases in costs 
as an integrated producer  u 
s 
steel s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore or taconite  carbon units in the form of coal and coke which is produced from coal and steel scrap 
the amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products  the quality of raw materials and  to a lesser extent  differences among steel producing equipment 
in broad terms  u 
s 
steel estimates that it consumes about tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and that it consumes over tons of iron ore pellets and a little less than tons of coke for each ton of raw steel produced 
while we believe that these estimates are useful for planning purposes  substantial variations occur 
iron ore logo with the iron ore facilities at minntac and keetac  which contain an estimated million short tons of recoverable reserves  u 
s 
steel has the capability of being completely self sufficient for its domestic iron ore requirements to support blast furnace production 
recoverable tons means the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses 
any surplus pellet production is sold to domestic and foreign consumers  including usse

the executive environmental committee  which is comprised of officers of u 
s 
steel  is charged with reviewing its overall performance with various environmental compliance programs 
also  u 
s 
steel  largely through the american iron and steel institute and the international iron and steel institute  continues its involvement in the development of various air  water and waste regulations with federal  state and local governments and international stakeholders concerning the implementation of cost effective pollution reduction strategies 
the domestic businesses of u 
s 
steel are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these environmental laws and regulations include the clean air act caa with respect to air emissions  the clean water act cwa with respect to water discharges  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment  storage and disposal  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances 
in addition  all states where u 
s 
steel operates have similar laws dealing with the same matters 
these laws are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that certain implementing regulations for laws such as rcra and the caa have not yet been promulgated or in certain instances are undergoing revision 
these environmental laws and regulations  particularly the caa  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
u 
s 
steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet caa obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u 
s 
steel s products and services  operating results will be adversely affected 
u 
s 
steel believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods 
u 
s 
steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to its prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
domestic integrated facilities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings  mini mills and other competitors generally do not have similar liabilities 
ussk is subject to the laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
the environmental requirements of slovakia and the eu are comparable to domestic environmental standards 
ussk s environmental expenses in included fees and or penalties totaling approximately million 
there are no legal proceedings pending against ussk involving environmental matters 
ussk has entered into an agreement with the slovak government to bring its facilities into environmental compliance in order to meet environmental standards as established from time to time by slovak law 
one current compliance project is a dedusting system for steel shop no 
to meet air emission standards for particulates 
these standards are applicable january  and ussk is attempting to complete the project by this deadline  however  project completion is currently anticipated for the first quarter failure to meet the applicable deadline could result in the imposition of corrective measures by the slovak ministry of environment ministry 
while the united states has not ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the european commission ec  in order to provide eu member states a mechanism for fulfilling their kyoto commitments  has established its own co 

limits for every eu member state 
in  the ec approved a national allocation plan for slovakia that reduced slovakia s originally proposed co allocation by approximately percent  and following that decision the ministry imposed an percent reduction to the amount of co allowances originally requested by ussk 
subsequently  ussk filed legal actions agains the ec and the ministry 
table of contents challenging these reductions 
in addition  ussk is evaluating a number of alternatives ranging from purchasing co allowances to reducing steel production  and it is not currently possible to predict the impact of these decisions on ussk 
however  the actual shortfall of allowances for the initial allocation period through will depend upon a number of internal and external variables and the effect of that shortfall on ussk cannot be predicted at this time 
based on the fair value of the anticipated shortfall of allowances related to production in  a long term other liability of million has been charged to income and recorded on the balance sheet 
domestically  while ratification of the kyoto protocol does not seem likely in the near term  there remains the possibility that the us environmental protection agency may impose limitations on greenhouse gases 
the impact on u 
s 
steel s domestic operations cannot be estimated 
ussb is subject to the laws of the union of serbia and montenegro 
these laws are currently less restrictive than either the eu or us standards  but this is expected to change over the next several years in anticipation of possible eu accession

the steel industry has historically been characterized by excess world supply 
this has led to substantial price decreases during periods of economic weakness  which have not been offset by commensurate price increases during periods of economic strength 
substitute materials are increasingly available for many steel products  which further reduces demand for steel 
rapidly growing demand and supply in china and other developing economies may result in additional excess worldwide capacity and falling steel prices 
over the last several years steel consumption in china and other developing economies such as india has increased at a rapid pace 
steel companies have responded by developing plans to rapidly increase steel production capability in these countries 
steel production  especially in china  has been expanding rapidly and could be well in excess of chinese demand depending on continuing demand growth rates 
because china is now the largest worldwide steel producer by a significant margin  any significant chinese capacity excess could have a major impact on world steel trade and prices if excess production is exported to other markets 
increases in prices and limited availability of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins 
steel producers require large amounts of raw materials iron ore or other iron containing material  steel scrap  coke and coal for integrated producers such as u 
s 
steel  and scrap for mini mill producers 
both integrated and mini mill producers consume large amounts of energy 
over the last several years  prices for raw materials and energy  in particular natural gas  have increased significantly 
in many cases these price increases have been a greater percentage than price increases for the sale of steel products 
u 
s 
steel and other steel producers have periodically been faced with problems in receiving sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner  resulting in production curtailments 
these production curtailments and escalated costs have reduced profit margins and may continue to do so in the future 

table of contents increased imports of steel products into the us could negatively affect domestic steel prices and demand levels and reduce profitability of domestic producers 
steel imports to the united states accounted for an estimated percent of the domestic steel market in  percent in and percent in foreign competitors typically have lower labor costs  and are often owned  controlled or subsidized by their governments  which allows their production and pricing decisions to be influenced by political and economic policy considerations as well as prevailing market conditions 
import levels may also be impacted by decisions of government agencies under us trade laws 
increases in future levels of imported steel could reduce future market prices and demand levels for domestic steel 
environmental compliance and remediation could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs 
domestic steel producers are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent 
the ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision 
environmental laws and regulations  particularly the clean air act  could result in substantially increased capital  operating and compliance costs 
international environmental requirements vary 
while standards in the european union and japan are generally comparable to domestic standards  other nations have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors in such nations a competitive advantage 
unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may reduce our results of operations 
our steel production depends on the operation of critical pieces of equipment  such as blast furnaces  casters and hot strip mills 
it is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unplanned equipment failures 
it is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages  explosions  fires  floods  accidents and severe weather conditions 
availability of supplies could also be affected by logistical disruptions shortages of barges or rail cars 
to the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage  our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected 
risk factors concerning u 
s 
steel legacy obligations many lawsuits have been filed against u 
s 
steel involving asbestos related injuries  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is a defendant in a large number of cases in which approximately  claimants actively allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
many of these cases involve multiple claimants often hundreds or thousands and defendants typically from fifty to more than one hundred 
it is possible that we may experience large judgments against us in the future that could have an impact upon the number of future claims filed against us and on the amount of future settlements  which would have an adverse impact on our profitability and cash flow 
our retiree employee health care and retiree life insurance plan costs  most of which are unfunded obligations  are higher than those of many of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we maintain defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance plans covering most of our domestic employees and former employees upon their retirement 
as of december   approximately  current retirees and beneficiaries are receiving pension and or medical benefits 
u 
s 
steel s underfunded benefit obligations for retiree medical and life insurance were billion at year end most of these underfunded obligations are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
other postretirement benefit expense is expected to be approximately million in 
table of contents many domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit retiree health care and life insurance plans and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage 
several domestic competitors provide defined contribution health care plans with contributions increased based upon profitability 
this will provide these competitors with a significant competitive advantage during periods of low profits 
our defined benefit pension plan costs are higher than those of our competitors 
these plans create a competitive disadvantage and negatively affect our profitability and cash flow 
we have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering many of our domestic employees and former employees upon their retirement 
the funded status of these plans declined from an overfunded position of billion at year end to an underfunded position of million at year end minimum contributions to these plans is controlled under erisa and other government regulations and substantial cash contributions may be required 
the amount of annual contributions may be substantially increased if congress adopts pension reform legislation such as that currently under consideration 
pension benefits are subject to collective bargaining agreements with unionized workforces and will be subject to future negotiations 
most domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit pension plans  but may provide defined contribution pension plans with contributions increasing based upon profitability 
this will provide these competitors with a significant competitive advantage during periods of low profits 
we have higher environmental remediation costs than our competitors 
this creates a competitive disadvantage and negatively affects our profitability and cash flow 
u 
s 
steel is currently involved in approximately remediation projects at currently operating facilities  facilities that have been closed or sold to third parties and other sites where material generated by u 
s 
steel was deposited 
in addition  there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation 
environmental remediation costs and related cash requirements of many of our competitors may be substantially less than ours 
many international competitors do not face similar laws in the jurisdictions where they operate 
numerous domestic competitors have substantially shorter operating histories than we do  resulting in less exposure for environmental remediation 
domestic competitors that have obtained relief under the bankruptcy code may have been released from certain environmental obligations that existed prior to the bankruptcy filing 
other risk factors applicable to u 
s 
steel the terms of our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
under the terms of our senior notes due and our senior notes due collectively  the senior notes  we are not able to pay dividends on capital stock unless we meet certain restricted payment tests 
the terms of our indebtedness and our accounts receivable program contain restrictive provisions that may limit our flexibility 
we have senior notes outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of million as of december  the senior notes impose significant restrictions on us such as limits on additional borrowings and certain investments and the use of funds from asset sales 
our million revolving credit agreement secured by inventory prohibits us from selling certain principal properties and imposes additional restrictions if the amount available to be borrowed under that agreement is less than million 
such restrictions include maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio and limitations on capital expenditures and investments 
the senior notes  the revolving credit agreement and some of our other loan facilities and leases have provisions that may cause a default under one of these agreements to become a default under the others 
these covenants may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities 

table of contents rating agencies may downgrade our credit ratings  which would make it more difficult for us to raise capital and would increase our financial costs 
any downgrade in our credit ratings would make raising capital more difficult  would increase the cost of future borrowings and would affect the terms on which we purchase goods and services 
in addition  the fees payable under our receivables sales program would increase and the amount of receivables eligible for sale could be reduced 
change in control clauses may require us to immediately purchase or repay debt 
upon the occurrence of change in control events specified in our senior notes  inventory facility and various other loan documents  the holders of our indebtedness may require us to immediately purchase or repay that debt on less than favorable terms 
we may not have the financial resources to make these purchases and repayments  and a failure to purchase or repay such indebtedness would trigger cross acceleration clauses under the senior notes and other indebtedness 
we have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize 
as of december   u 
s 
steel had net federal  foreign and state deferred tax assets of million 
although management believes that it is more likely than not that future operating results and tax planning strategies generating sufficient future taxable income can be utilized to realize the net deferred tax assets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate such results or implement these strategies 
our international operations expose us to uncertainties and risks from abroad  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
ussk  located in the slovak republic  and ussb  located in serbia  constitute nearly of our total raw steel production capability  and accounted for of net sales for both ussk and ussb are subject to economic conditions and political factors in europe  which if changed could negatively affect their results of operations and cash flow 
political factors include  but are not limited to  taxation  nationalization  inflation  currency fluctuations  increased regulation and quotas  tariffs and other protectionist measures 
ussk and ussb are also subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
any future international acquisitions would expose us to similar risks 
natural gas supplies to ussb may be curtailed and such curtailments would have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows 
ussb is dependent upon availability of natural gas in serbia  which is dependent upon a single pipeline 
serbia has experienced major curtailments during periods of peak demand in eastern europe 
such curtailments have forced ussb to interrupt steel production and finishing operations in the past and this could recur in the future 
the carbon dioxide emission limits established by the european commission may limit the amount of steel that can be produced at ussk and negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow 
the european commission ec has established carbon dioxide co emission limits for eu member countries 
under this program the slovak ministry of the environment has reduced the amount of co that ussk may emit 
ussk may be required to reduce its production or purchase emission credits  either of which may have a negative impact on income and cash flow 
our business requires substantial debt service  contingent obligations  capital investment  operating lease  capital commitments and maintenance expenditures that we may be unable to fulfill 
with approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december   we have substantial debt service requirements 
interest and other financial costs  excluding foreign currency losses  interest income  capitalized 
table of contents interest and the adjustment from the gary property tax settlement  totaled million in and are expected to be about the same in  however  interest and other financial costs will change with changes to our capital structure 
our operations are capital intensive 
for the five year period ended december   total capital expenditures were billion 
ussk has a commitment to the slovak government for a capital improvements program over a period commencing with the acquisition date and ending on december  as of december   the remaining commitment under this program was million 
at december   our domestic contract commitments to acquire property  plant and equipment totaled million and we were obligated to make aggregate lease payments of million under operating leases 
in addition to capital expenditures and lease payments  we spend significant amounts for maintenance of raw material  raw steel and steel finishing production facilities  including periodic relines or rebuilds of our seventeen blast furnaces 
as of december   we had contingent obligations consisting of indemnity obligations under active surety bonds  trusts and letters of credit totaling approximately million  guarantees of approximately million of indebtedness for unconsolidated entities and contractual purchase commitments under purchase orders and take or pay arrangements of approximately billion  plus contingencies under the sale of our mining assets of approximately million 
as the general partner of the clairton b partnership  lp  we are obligated to fund cash shortfalls incurred by that partnership but may withdraw as the general partner if we are required to fund in excess of million in operating cash shortfalls 
as of december   we were also contingently liable for million of debt and other obligations of marathon 
our business may not generate sufficient operating cash flow or external financing sources may not be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to service or refinance our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
u 
s 
steel is exposed to uninsured losses 
u 
s 
steel s insurance coverage against catastrophic casualty and business interruption exposures contains certain common exclusions  substantial deductibles and self insurance retentions 
our collective bargaining agreements may limit our flexibility 
the collective bargaining agreement with the uswa contains provisions that prohibit us from pursuing any north american transaction involving steel or steel related assets without the consent of the uswa  grants the uswa a right to bid on any sale of one or more facilities covered by the collective bargaining agreement and requires us to make reasonable and necessary capital expenditures to maintain the competitive status of our domestic facilities 
that agreement also restricts our ability to trade  sell or use foreign produced coke and iron ore in north america  and further requires that the ratio of non uswa employees to uswa employees at our domestic facilities not exceed to strikes  work stoppages and customer concern about the possibility of strikes  particularly upon the expiration of our major domestic collective bargaining agreement  could adversely impact our relationships with our customers which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  mini mill producers and certain foreign competitors and producers of comparable products do not have unionized work forces 
this may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
while other domestic integrated unionized steel producers have similar requirements in their agreements with the uswa  foreign and non union domestic producers are not subject to such requirements 
u 
s 
steel is involved in multiemployer plans covering pensions and other postretirement benefit costs 
we have legal and contractual requirements for future funding of these plans  which will have a negative effect on our cash flows 
in addition  funding requirements for participants could increase as a result of any underfunding of these plans 

table of contents u 
s 
steel is subject to work stoppages as a result of periodic labor negotiations at facilities in europe 
most employees at ussk and ussb are represented by unions pursuant to agreements that expire in december and november  respectively  both of which are subject to annual wage rate negotiations 
any strike or work stoppage upon expiration of the current agreements or as a result of the inability to agree on annual wage rates could have significant negative effects on results of operations 
customer payment defaults could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
many of our customers operate in cyclical industries and could experience financial difficulties in times of economic downturn 
in some cases  these difficulties may result in bankruptcy filings or cessation of operations 
if customers experiencing financial problems default on paying amounts owed to us  we may not be able to collect these amounts or recognize expected revenue 
any material payment defaults by our customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
there are risks associated with acquisitions 
the success of recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions will depend substantially on our ability to integrate the acquired operations successfully with existing operations 
if we are unable to integrate new operations successfully  our financial results and business reputation could suffer 
recent acquisitions in the steel industry have involved prices significantly higher than the prices we paid for our recent acquisitions 
such prices will make it more difficult to achieve adequate financial returns 
additional risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  the possible assumption of unknown liabilities  potential disputes with the sellers  and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have limited or no prior experience 
international acquisitions may present unique challenges and increase the company s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations 
provisions of delaware law  our governing documents and our rights plan may make a takeover of u 
s 
steel more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation and by laws and our rights plan could make more difficult or delay our acquisition by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise and the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions are intended to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids  even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price

item legal proceedings u 
s 
steel is the subject of  or a party to  a number of pending or threatened legal actions  contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters  including laws and regulations relating to the environment 
certain of these matters are included below in this discussion 
the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could  individually or in the aggregate  be material to the financial statements 
however  management believes that u 
s 
steel will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably 
asbestos litigation u 
s 
steel is a defendant in approximately active cases  involving approximately  plaintiffs 
many of these cases involve multiple defendants typically from fifty to more than one hundred defendants 
more than  or approximately percent  of these claims are pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u 
s 
steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u 
s 
steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
these claims against u 
s 
steel fall into three major groups claims made under certain federal and general maritime laws by employees of the great lakes fleet or intercoastal fleet  former operations of u 
s 
steel  claims made by persons who allegedly were exposed to asbestos at u 
s 
steel facilities referred to as premises claims  and claims made by industrial workers allegedly exposed to products formerly manufactured by u 
s 
steel 
while u 
s 
steel has excess casualty insurance  these policies have multi million dollar self insured retentions 
to date  u 
s 
steel has not received any payments under these policies relating to asbestos claims 
in most cases  this excess casualty insurance is the only insurance applicable to asbestos claims 
these asbestos cases allege a variety of respiratory and other diseases based on alleged exposure to asbestos 
u 
s 
steel is currently a defendant in cases in which a total of approximately plaintiffs allege that they are suffering from mesothelioma 
the potential for damages against defendants may be greater in cases in which the plaintiffs can prove mesothelioma 
in many such cases in which claims have been asserted against u 
s 
steel  the plaintiffs have been unable to establish any causal relationship to u 
s 
steel or its products or premises 
in addition  in many asbestos cases  the plaintiffs have been unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any identifiable injury or compensable loss at all  that any injuries that they have incurred did in fact result from alleged exposure to asbestos  or that such alleged exposure was in any way related to u 
s 
steel or its products or premises 
in every asbestos case in which u 
s 
steel is named as a party  the complaints are filed against numerous named defendants and generally do not contain allegations regarding specific monetary damages sought 
to the extent that any specific amount of damages is sought  the amount applies to claims against all named defendants and in 
table of contents no case is there any allegation of monetary damages against u 
s 
steel 
in  approximately percent of the cases filed against u 
s 
steel stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed jurisdictional amounts generally range from  to 
approximately percent did not specify any damages at all  approximately percent alleged damages of million and less than half of one percent alleged damages exceeding million 
historically  over percent of the cases against u 
s 
steel did not specify any damage amount or stated that the damages sought exceeded the amount required to establish jurisdiction of the court in which the case was filed 
u 
s 
steel does not consider the amount of damages alleged  if any  in a complaint to be relevant in assessing its potential exposure to asbestos liabilities 
the ultimate outcome of any claim depends upon a myriad of legal and factual issues  including whether the plaintiff can prove actual disease  if any  actual exposure  if any  to u 
s 
steel products  or the duration of exposure to asbestos  if any  on u 
s 
steel s premises 
u 
s 
steel has noted over the years that the form of complaint including its allegations  if any  concerning damages often depends upon the form of complaint filed by particular law firms and attorneys 
often the same damage allegation will be in multiple complaints regardless of the number of plaintiffs  the number of defendants  or any specific diseases or conditions alleged 
u 
s 
steel aggressively pursues grounds for the dismissal of u 
s 
steel from pending cases and litigates cases to verdict where it believes litigation is appropriate 
u 
s 
steel also makes efforts to settle appropriate cases  especially mesothelioma cases  for reasonable  and frequently nominal  amounts 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
in  except for the aberrant result in the madison county case referred to in the following paragraph  u 
s 
steel settled claims for a total of approximately million  and had a total of  claims dismissed or otherwise resolved and added new cases or  new claims 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
during  u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
these settlements and voluntary and involuntary dismissals resulted in the disposition of approximately  claims 
new case filings added  claims 
at december   u 
s 
steel had a total of approximately  active claims outstanding 
during  u 
s 
steel paid approximately million in settlements 
these settlements  along with review of case docket information for certain states and voluntary and involuntary dismissals  resulted in the disposition of approximately  claims 
new case filings added approximately  claims 
on march   a jury in madison county  illinois returned a verdict against u 
s 
steel for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
u 
s 
steel believes that the court erred as a matter of law by failing to find that the plaintiff s exclusive remedy was provided by the indiana workers compensation law 
u 
s 
steel believes that this issue and other errors at trial would have enabled u 
s 
steel to succeed on appeal 
however  in order to avoid the delay and uncertainties of further litigation and the posting of a large appeal bond in excess of the amount of the verdict  u 
s 
steel settled this case for an amount which was substantially less than the compensatory damages award and which represented a small fraction of the total award 
this settlement is reflected in the results for the quarter ended march   and for the year ended december  management views the verdict and resulting settlement in the madison county case as aberrational  and believes that the likelihood of similar results in other cases is remote  although not impossible 
u 
s 
steel has not experienced any material adverse change in its ability to resolve pending claims as a result of the madison county settlement 
the amount u 
s 
steel has accrued for pending asbestos claims is not material to u 
s 
steel s financial position 
u 
s 
steel does not accrue for unasserted asbestos claims because it believes it is not possible to determine whether any loss is probable with respect to such claims or even to estimate the amount or range of any possible losses 
among the reasons that u 
s 
steel cannot reasonably estimate the number and nature of claims against it is that the vast majority of pending claims against it allege so called premises liability based exposure on u 
s 
steel s current or former premises 
these claims are made by an indeterminable number of people such as truck drivers  railroad workers  salespersons  contractors and their employees  government inspectors  customers  visitors and even trespassers 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u 
s 
steel s results of operations and cash flows for a given period could be adversely affected by asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on the company s financial condition 
among the factors considered in reaching this conclusion are that u 
s 
steel has been subject to a total of approximately  asbestos claims over the past years that have been administratively dismissed or are inactive due to the failure of the plaintiffs to present any medical evidence supporting their claims  that over the last several years  the total number of pending claims has generally declined  that it has been many years since u 
s 
steel employed maritime workers or manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  and u 
s 
steel s history of trial outcomes  settlements and dismissals  including such matters since the madison county jury verdict and settlement in march the foregoing statements of belief are forward looking statements 
predictions as to the outcome of pending litigation are subject to substantial uncertainties with respect to among other things factual and judicial determinations  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
environmental proceedings the following is a summary of the proceedings of u 
s 
steel that were pending or contemplated as of december   under federal and state environmental laws 
except as described herein  it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
cercla remediation sites claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and related state acts have been raised with respect to the cleanup of various waste disposal and other sites 
cercla is intended to expedite the cleanup of hazardous substances without regard to fault 
potentially responsible parties prps for each site include present and former owners and operators of  transporters to and generators of the substances at the site 
liability is strict and can be joint and several 
because of various factors including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred  it is impossible to reasonably estimate u 
s 
steel s ultimate cost of compliance with cercla 
projections  provided in the following paragraphs  of spending for and or timing of completion of specific projects are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the factors provided in the preceding paragraph 
to the extent that these assumptions prove to be inaccurate  future spending for  or timing of completion of environmental projects may differ materially from what was stated in forward looking statements 
at december   u 
s 
steel had been identified as a prp at a total of cercla sites 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that u 
s 
steel s liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be between  and million per site  and for of these sites will be under  at the remaining two sites  management expects that u 
s 
steel s share in the remaining cleanup costs at each site will exceed million  although it is not possible to accurately predict the amount of final allocation of such costs 
the following is a summary of the status of these sites in october  the pennsylvania department of environmental resources pader placed the municipal industrial disposal co 
site in elizabeth  pa 
on the pennsylvania state superfund list and began a remedial investigation ri  which was issued in u 
s 
steel and the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep signed a consent order and agreement on august   under which u 
s 
steel is responsible for remediation of this site 
in the consent order and agreement became final 
u 
s 
steel estimates its future liability at the site to be million 
in november  u 
s 
steel received a cercla e request from the us environmental protection agency epa requesting information on the former waste oil processing site named 
table of contents breslube penn located in coraopolis  pa 
u 
s 
steel joined a prp group and entered into an administrative order on consent along with six other prps to conduct a ri feasibility study fs 
the ri has been completed and the fs  which was submitted to epa  is currently being reviewed by epa and padep 
the total cost to implement a remediation project is not presently determinable 
u 
s 
steel s share of the costs for this project will depend upon epa s selection of an alternative from the range of alternatives presented in the fs and the number of prps available to allocate the costs 
u 
s 
steel anticipates that more prps may be added to the group by epa before the costs of remediation are allocated 
u 
s 
steel has an accrual of million for this site 
in addition  there are sites related to u 
s 
steel where information requests have been received or there are other indications that u 
s 
steel may be a prp under cercla  but where sufficient information is not presently available to confirm the existence of liability or to make any judgment as to the amount thereof 
other remediation activities there are additional sites where remediation is being sought under other environmental statutes  both federal and state  or where private parties are seeking remediation through discussions or litigation 
based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  management believes that liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with of these sites will be under  per site  another sites have potential costs between  and million per site  and sites may involve remediation costs between million and million

overview u 
s 
steel  the seventh largest steel producer in the world and the second largest integrated steel producer in north america  has a broad and diverse mix of products and customers 
u 
s 
steel uses iron ore  coal  coke  and steel scrap to produce a wide range of steel products  concentrating on value added steel products for customers with demanding technical applications in the automotive  appliance  container  industrial machinery  construction and oil and gas industries 
in addition to its domestic facilities  u 
s 
steel has significant operations in central europe through u 
s 
steel kosice ussk  located in slovakia  and u 
s 
steel balkan ussb  located in serbia 
u 
s 
steel s financial results are primarily determined by the combined effects of shipment volume  selling prices  production costs and product mix 
the primary drivers for u 
s 
steel are economic conditions in the united states  europe and  to a lesser extent  other steel consuming regions  the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption  pension and other postretirement benefits opeb costs  and raw material iron ore  coal  coke  steel scrap  zinc and tin and energy natural gas and electricity costs 
u 
s 
steel s long term success depends on our ability to implement our strategy to continue to increase our value added product mix  to expand our global business platform  to improve our capital structure and strengthen our balance sheet  to improve our reliability and cost competitiveness  and to become a world leader in safety performance 
in north america  u 
s 
steel is focused on providing value added steel products to its target markets 
in europe  u 
s 
steel s strategy is to be a leading producer and the prime supplier of steel to growing european markets  and to invest in value added facilities  including an automotive hot dip galvanizing line that is currently under construction 
for a fuller description of our strategy  see item business description business strategy 
some of the other key issues which will impact the global steel industry  including u 
s 
steel  are the sustainability of higher steel prices  the cost of purchased raw materials and energy  the level of unfunded pension and opeb liabilities  the magnitude and durability of the world economic recovery  and the impact of production and consumption of steel in china  which has resulted in volatility in steel raw material supplies and global steel pricing 
steel imports to the united states in were lower than levels 
import levels may increase in depending on the relative strength of the us dollar  market pricing  consumption in the united states versus other regions and foreign production levels 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of u 
s 
steel s financial condition and results of operations is based upon u 
s 
steel s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the year 
management regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for deferred income taxes  potential tax deficiencies  environmental obligations  potential litigation claims and settlements  and assets and obligations related to employee benefits 
management estimates are based on 
table of contents historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
pensions and opeb the recording of net periodic benefit costs credits for defined benefit pensions and opeb are based on  among other things  assumptions of the expected annual return on plan assets  discount rate  escalation or other changes in retiree health care costs and plan participation levels 
changes in the assumptions or differences between actual and expected changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of u 
s 
steel s plans could cause net periodic benefit costs to increase or decrease materially from year to year as discussed below 
u 
s 
steel bases its estimate of the annual expected return on plan assets on the historical long term rate of return experienced by u 
s 
steel s plan assets  the investment mix of plan assets between debt  equities and other investments  and its view of market returns expected in the future 
based on a review of these factors  u 
s 
steel has kept the expected annual return on pension plan assets for its main pension plan at percent for the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in setting these rates  we utilize several merrill lynch average aaa aa corporate bond indexes and both the year and the year u 
s 
treasury bond rates as a preliminary indication of interest rate movements and levels  and we also look to an internally calculated rate determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher rated zero coupon corporate bonds theoretically available in the marketplace 
based on this evaluation at december   u 
s 
steel lowered the discount rate used to measure both pension and opeb obligations from percent to percent 
lower discount rates increase the actuarial losses of the plans and will unfavorably impact net periodic benefit costs by approximately million for pensions in principally due to the impact of required amortization amounts 
u 
s 
steel determines the escalation trend in per capita health care costs based on historical rate experience under u 
s 
steel s insurance plans 
assumed health care cost trend rates no longer have a significant effect on the amounts reported for u 
s 
steel s health care plans  other than the benefit plan offered to retired mineworkers  since a cost cap was negotiated in with the uswa  which freezes steelworker retiree medical costs after the base year 
most non union benefits are limited to flat dollar payments that are not affected by escalation 
for measurement purposes  u 
s 
steel has assumed an initial escalation rate of percent for this rate is assumed to decrease gradually to an ultimate rate of percent in and remain at that level thereafter 
net periodic pension cost  excluding multiemployer plans  is expected to total approximately million in total opeb costs in are expected to be approximately million 

table of contents a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical percent change in the significant assumptions used in the pension and opeb calculations is provided in the following table hypothetical rate increase decrease in millions of dollars expected return on plan assets incremental increase decrease in expected pension costs for discount rate incremental increase decrease in expected pension opeb costs for pension opeb liabilities at december  health care cost escalation trend rates incremental increase decrease in expected opeb costs for changes in the assumptions for expected annual return on plan assets and the discount rate do not impact the funding calculations used to derive minimum funding requirements for the pension plans 
for further cash flow discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition  cash flows and liquidity liquidity 
asset impairments asset impairments are recognized when the carrying value of those productive assets exceeds their aggregate projected undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows are based on management s long range estimates of market conditions and the overall performance associated with the individual asset or asset grouping 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if the probability of disposition of the assets differs from that previously estimated by management  additional asset write downs may be required 
taxes u 
s 
steel records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should u 
s 
steel determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
u 
s 
steel expects to generate future taxable income to realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets 
u 
s 
steel makes no provision for deferred us and certain foreign income taxes on the undistributed earnings of ussk and other consolidated foreign subsidiaries because management intends  without regard to the one time repatriation in  to permanently reinvest such earnings in foreign operations 
see note to the financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings at december   net of the million repatriation  amounted to approximately  million 
if such earnings were not permanently reinvested  a us deferred tax liability of approximately million would have been required 
u 
s 
steel records liabilities for potential tax deficiencies 
these liabilities are based on management s judgment of the risk of loss should those items be challenged by taxing authorities 
in the event that u 
s 
steel were to determine that tax related items would not be considered deficiencies or that items previously not considered to be potential deficiencies could be considered potential tax deficiencies as a result of an audit  tax ruling or other positions or authority  an adjustment to the liability would be recorded through income in the period such determination was made 
environmental remediation u 
s 
steel provides for remediation costs and penalties when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs is reasonably determinable 
remediation liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental exposures and are discounted in certain instances 
u 
s 
steel regularly monitors the progress of environmental remediation 
should studies indicate that the cost of 
table of contents remediation is to be more than previously estimated  an additional accrual would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 
as of december   total accruals for environmental remediation were million  excluding liabilities related to asset retirement obligations under statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
change in accounting method during the fourth quarter of  u 
s 
steel changed its method of determining the cost of ussk inventories from the last in  first out lifo method to the first in  first out fifo method 
management considers the fifo method to be preferable to the lifo method for ussk because it creates consistency of the valuation method used for inventories within the usse reportable segment and provides for comparability of the usse segment with major international competitors 
in accordance with fas no 
 prior period results have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively

the foreign currency effects were primarily due to remeasurement of ussk and ussb net monetary assets into the us dollar  which was the functional currency of both prior to january  u 
s 
steel is subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on revenues and operating costs  firm commitments for capital expenditures and existing assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for most of our operations outside the united states was the us dollar through december  as of january   the functional currency for ussk and ussb was changed from the us dollar to the euro primarily because of significant changes in economic facts and circumstances as a result of slovakia s entry into the european union and the subsequent entry of the slovak koruna into the exchange rate mechanizm ii in preparation for slovakia s adoption of the euro 
other factors that contributed to this change are the evolution of usse into an autonomous business segment  the settlement of its us dollar denominated debt and the establishment of euro based debt facilities 
this change in functional currency will be applied on a prospective basis

the valuation allowance for domestic taxes was reversed through equity in at december   the amount of net foreign deferred tax assets recorded was million  net of an established valuation allowance of million 
net foreign deferred tax assets will fluctuate as the value of the us dollar changes with respect to the slovak koruna and the serbian dinar 
a full valuation allowance is recorded for serbian deferred tax assets due to the cumulative losses experienced since the acquisition of ussb 
if ussb generates sufficient income  the valuation allowance of million for serbian taxes could be partially or fully reversed at such time that it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
management will continue to monitor and assess taxable income  deferred tax assets and tax planning strategies to determine the need for  and the appropriate amount of  any valuation allowance

steel accrues an annual cost for these benefit obligations under plans covering its active and retiree populations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations will require corporate cash in future years to the extent that trust assets are restricted or insufficient and to the extent that company contributions are required by law or union labor agreement 
amounts in the years through reflect our current estimate of corporate cash outflows and are net of the projected use of funds available from asset trusts 
the accuracy of this forecast of future cash flows depends on various factors such as actual asset returns  the mix of assets within the asset trusts  medical escalation and discount rates used to calculate obligations  the availability of surplus pension assets allowable for transfer to pay retiree medical claims and company decisions or voluntary employee benefit association restrictions that impact the timing of the use of trust assets 
also  as such  the amounts shown could differ significantly from what is actually expended and  at this time  it is impossible to make a reliable prediction of cash requirements beyond five years 
g amount of contractual cash obligations is not determinable because other post retirement benefit cash obligation estimates are not reliable beyond five years  as discussed in f above

increases in interest rates can increase the cost of future borrowings and make it more difficult to raise capital 
this opinion is a forward looking statement based upon currently available information 
to the extent that operating cash flow is materially lower than current levels or external financing sources are not available on terms competitive with those currently available  future liquidity may be adversely affected

steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital  operating and maintenance  and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations 
in recent years  these expenditures have been mainly for process changes in order to meet clean air act obligations  although ongoing compliance costs have also been significant 
to the extent these expenditures  as with all costs  are not ultimately reflected in the prices of u

steel s products and services  operating results will be reduced 
u

steel believes that its major domestic integrated steel competitors are confronted by substantially similar conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors is materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations 
however  the costs and operating restrictions necessary for compliance with environmental laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on u 
s 
steel s competitive position with regard to domestic mini mills and some foreign steel producers and producers of materials which compete with steel  which may not be required to undertake equivalent costs in their operations 
in addition  the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors  including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods

steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to its prior disposal of environmentally sensitive materials 
domestic integrated facilities that have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings  mini mills and other competitors generally do not have similar liabilities 
ussk is subject to the laws of slovakia and the european union eu 
the environmental requirements of slovakia and the eu are comparable to domestic environmental standards

one current compliance project is a dedusting system 
table of contents for steel shop no 
to meet air emission standards for particulates 
these standards are applicable january  and ussk is attempting to complete the project by this deadline  however  project completion is currently anticipated for the first quarter failure to meet the applicable deadline could result in the imposition of corrective measures by the slovak ministry of environment ministry 
while the united states has not ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change  the european commission ec  in order to provide eu member states a mechanism for fulfilling their kyoto commitments  has established its own co 

limits for every eu member state 
in  the ec approved a national allocation plan for slovakia that reduced slovakia s originally proposed co allocation by approximately percent  and following that decision the ministry imposed an percent reduction to the amount of co allowances originally requested by ussk 
subsequently  ussk filed legal actions agains the ec and the ministry challenging these reductions 
in addition  ussk is evaluating a number of alternatives ranging from purchasing co allowances to reducing steel production  and it is not currently possible to predict the impact of these decisions on ussk 
however  the actual shortfall of allowances for the initial allocation period through will depend upon a number of internal and external variables and the effect of that shortfall on ussk cannot be predicted at this time 
based on the fair value of the anticipated shortfall of allowances related to production in  a long term other liability of million has been charged to income and recorded on the balance sheet 
domestically  while ratification of the kyoto protocol does not seem likely in the near term  there remains the possibility that the us environmental protection agency may impose limitations on greenhouse gases

steel is a defendant in approximately active asbestos cases  involving approximately  plaintiffs 
many of these cases involve multiple defendants typically from fifty to more than one hundred defendants 
more than  or approximately percent  of these claims are pending in jurisdictions which permit filings with massive numbers of plaintiffs 
based upon u

steel s experience in such cases  it believes that the actual number of plaintiffs who ultimately assert claims against u

steel will likely be a small fraction of the total number of plaintiffs 
on march   a jury in madison county  illinois returned a verdict against u

steel for million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
u

steel to succeed on appeal 
however  in order to avoid the delay and uncertainties of further litigation and the posting of a large appeal bond in excess of the amount of the verdict  u 
s 
steel settled this case for an amount which was substantially less than the compensatory damages award and which represented a small fraction of the total award 
this settlement is reflected in the results for the quarter ended march   and for the year ended december  the senate judiciary committee has recommended to the senate legislation that  if enacted  would create an asbestos trust fund that would provide benefits to asbestos claimants funded by payments over years of 
table of contents billion from companies and their insurers that have been involved in asbestos litigation  including u 
s 
steel along with thousands of others 
the legislation would provide an administrative system to process asbestos claims instead of resolution through judicial proceedings 
the amount that a company would be required to pay under the current version of the legislation would depend upon its placement among several tiers and sub tiers  based upon corporate revenue and prior expenditures related to asbestos defense costs  settlements and judgments 
management estimates that if the legislation were adopted in the form proposed by the judiciary committee  the annual cost to u 
s 
steel would be somewhat greater than the historical cost of asbestos defense and settlement 
it is unclear whether any legislation will be adopted and any final legislation may be substantially different than the version recommended by the judiciary committee 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of asbestos related lawsuits  claims and proceedings due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation 
despite this uncertainty  and although u

steel europe  first quarter shipments are expected to increase and average realized prices and costs should be consistent with fourth quarter levels 
however  first quarter results will be negatively affected by production curtailments at serbian operations as a result of natural gas supply disruptions and could also be negatively affected by potential job related actions by a labor union at ussb that is dissatisfied with the wage agreement  which became effective upon approval of the other unions 
shipments and average realized prices for the tubular segment in the first quarter of are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments u 
s 
steel uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its market risk 
management has authorized the use of futures  forwards  swaps and options to manage exposure to price fluctuations related to the purchase of natural gas and nonferrous metals  and also certain business transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
derivative instruments used for trading and other activities have been marked to market and the resulting gains or losses recognized in the current period in income from operations 
for future periods  u 
s 
steel may elect to use hedge accounting for certain transactions  primarily related to forecasted natural gas purchases 
for those transactions  the impact of the effective portion of the hedging instrument will be recognized in other comprehensive income until the natural gas purchase is settled 
once the purchase is settled  the effect of the hedged item will be recognized in income 
while u 
s 
steel s risk management activities generally reduce market risk exposure due to unfavorable commodity price changes for raw material purchases and products sold  such activities can also encompass strategies that assume price risk 
management believes that the use of derivative instruments  along with risk assessment procedures and internal controls  does not expose u 
s 
steel to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect u
