 accounting for income taxes  of the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets 
as a result of this evaluation  management concluded that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would be realized 
this conclusion was based on various factors  the most significant of which were the company s record of generation of taxable income over the four years since june   during which years the company has generated federal taxable income that has reduced its federal net operating loss carryforward from million to approximately million  the company s consistency in generating net income during each of those four years  and management s belief that the company is well positioned to generate profits on an ongoing basis such that all tax net operating losses will be utilized prior to any applicable expiration dates 
there remains approximately million for federal and million for state tax purposes of net operating loss carryovers which expire in various years through to offset current tax expenses 
the ultimate realization of the benefits from the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s future earnings  the future tax laws in effect  and other unknown factors  all of which are uncertain

effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the inflation of recent years 
materials that are petroleum based eg resin  gel coat  foam or that contain nickel eg stainless steel have been subject to significant price increases  and fuel surcharges have increased freight costs 
the company has been able to minimize the effect of material price increases by negotiating favorable purchase agreements with suppliers  using alternative  less costly materials  by finding less costly sources for materials and increasing selling prices of its products to recover the cost increases 
the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material

critical accounting policies 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on the company s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of boats 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to dealers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable  and the ability to collect is reasonably assured 
the company offers discounts and sales incentives 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability would be adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on past loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate ability to collect a specific account or invoice 
reserve for obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
refer to note  nature of the business and significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the basis of accounting for inventories 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected warranty costs 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates  and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company estimates its probable tax obligations based on historical experience and current tax laws and litigation 
the judgments made at any point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and settlements of tax litigation  as well as changes due to new tax laws and regulations and the company s interpretations of those laws and regulations 
these factors may cause the tax rate for the company to increase or decrease 
as of june  the company had net deferred tax assets of  that were fully offset by a valuation allowance because  as of that date  it was management s conclusion that there continued to be doubt as to whether those deferred tax assets were more likely than not to be realized in the future
