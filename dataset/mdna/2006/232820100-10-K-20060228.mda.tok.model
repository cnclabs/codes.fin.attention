item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in part i of this report 
currency amounts are in millions  except per share amounts 
percentages are approximate 
general we are a global specialty chemicals and materials company which sells our products to diverse major markets for aerospace  adhesives  automotive and industrial coatings  chemical intermediates  inks  mining  plastics and water treatment 
sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management 
in the course of our ongoing operations  a number of strategic product line acquisitions and dispositions have been made 
the results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated results from the dates of the respective acquisitions 
on february   we acquired the surface specialties business of ucb in a transaction valued at  after adjusting for a final working capital adjustment of and transaction costs incurred of  the acquisition was valued at  a further discussion of acquisitions and dispositions can be found in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
we also report net sales in four geographic regions north america  latin america  asia pacific and europe middle east africa 
the destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management s view of the business 
north america consists of the united states and canada 
latin america includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean islands 
asia pacific is comprised of asia  australia and the islands of the south pacific rim 
raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility 
oil and natural gas costs are significantly higher than the year ago period and many of our raw materials are derived from these two commodities 
discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion 
in addition  higher global demand levels and  occasionally  operating difficulties at suppliers  have limited the availability of certain of our raw materials 
hurricane activity in the us gulf region led to further increases in the cost of natural gas and oil related raw materials 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship that certain items in our consolidated statements of income bear to net sales years ended december  net sales manufacturing cost of sales gross profit selling and technical services research and process development administrative and general amortization of acquisition intangibles earnings from operations net earnings available to common stockholders net sales by segment and geographic area europe north latin asia middle east net sales america america pacific africa total cytec performance chemicals cytec surface specialties  cytec engineered materials building block chemicals total    cytec performance chemicals cytec surface specialties cytec engineered materials building block chemicals total  cytec performance chemicals cytec surface specialties cytec engineered materials building block chemicals total  net sales in the united states were  and for  and  respectively

for more information on our segments  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and further discussions in segment results  below 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  consolidated results net sales for were  compared with  for  up of which was due to the inclusion of sales from surface specialties which was acquired on february   selling prices increased  exchange rates increased sales and selling volumes were up 
cytec performance chemicals experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales of the acquired pressure sensitive adhesives and polyurethanes product lines of surface specialties as well as from selling price increases 
cytec surface specialties experienced a net increase in sales which resulted primarily from the addition of sales related to the remainder of the acquired product lines of surface specialties 
cytec engineered materials sales increase was primarily volume related  primarily from increased sales to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors 
building block chemicals sales increased from higher selling prices  while volumes decreased 
net sales and operating results for the building blocks segment were significantly impacted by the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita in the us gulf coast 
for a detailed discussion on revenues refer to the segment results section below 
manufacturing cost of sales was  compared with  during this increase was primarily attributable to the following items the inclusion of the acquired surface specialties business  higher raw material and energy costs of  a charge of representing the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing cost and the direct impact from the hurricanes of for maintenance and repair costs  extra labor and related expenses  energy and start up costs 
also included was approximately of employee severance costs related to a restructuring that occurred during the second half of pension expense increased principally as a result of additional plans acquired upon acquisition and to a lesser extent  the lowering of the discount rate in the u 
s 
by to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities 
pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales 
selling and technical services was versus in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following items the inclusion of the acquired surface specialties business  of employee severance costs  of unfavorable exchange rate changes  and from increased investments in people and qualification work on a number of new aircraft platforms for our customers in the cytec engineered materials segment 
research and process development was versus in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the acquired surface specialties business and related to restructuring charges 
the write off of acquired in process research and development of was the result of the surface specialties acquisition 
administrative and general expenses were versus in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following items the inclusion of the acquired surface specialties business  a charge of related to the settlement of a litigation matter and employee severance costs of included in administrative expenses for the prior year period is a charge of related to the settlement of a federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters 
amortization of acquisition intangibles was versus in the prior year due to the amortization of intangibles related to the acquired surface specialties business 
other income expense  net was expense of compared with income of in the prior year 
we entered into derivative contracts to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposures associated with the surface specialties acquisition 
these contracts were settled following completion of the acquisition and resulted in a loss of during the foreign currency contracts have matured 
in anticipation of the long term debt that was subsequently issued in october  to refinance debt  we also entered into interest rate derivatives which resulted in the recognition of a loss of in also included in was a charge of for a settlement to resolve a dispute over an environmental matter 
included in results was a net gain of related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of surface specialties 
also included in results were charges of for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with the holder of our series c preferred stock series c stock 
equity in earnings of associated companies was versus in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in earnings by cyro even though the results include only the five months of results 
we sold our ownership stake in cyro on june  interest expense  net was compared with in the prior year 
the increase resulted from higher outstanding debt balances incurred in conjunction with our acquisition of surface specialties and of interest charges and unamortized put premiums and rate lock agreements related to the optional redemption of our mandatory par put remarketed securities mopprs in our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was a tax benefit of 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was favorably impacted by a reduction in income tax expense of related to a partial resolution of a tax audit in norway with respect to prior year tax returns and a reduction in income tax expense of recorded related to final approval of the internal revenue service s examination of our tax returns for the years through also favorably impacting the rate were the losses of incurred in the us on interest rate and currency derivatives entered into in connection with surface specialties acquisition and the charge pertaining to the optional redemption of the mopprs 
the tax benefit on these losses was recorded at 
unfavorably impacting the tax rate was a charge of for the write off of in process research and development expenses related to the surface specialties acquisition for which no tax benefit was recorded 
excluding these items  our underlying annual effective tax rate would have been 
the comparable effective tax rate in was  which excludes acquisition related net currency and interest rate hedge gains 
the increase in the underlying annual effective tax rate versus last year was primarily attributable to the addition of earnings from acquired surface specialties entities in countries with higher tax rates than in countries for heritage cytec 
earnings from discontinued operations were in  net of taxes of and reflect the results of surface specialties amino resins ssar product line for the six months ended august   the date on which we divested ssar

cytec performance chemicals change due to total acquistion change price volume mix currency north america latin america asia pacific europe middle east africa total overall selling volume increased  with the acquisition accounting for an increase of  partly offset by a decrease in base selling volumes of  primarily due to the sluggish demand in north american and europe as well as our decision to give up low margin business 
on a regional basis  sales volume in north america increased with acquisitions accounting for 
the decrease in base volumes is primarily attributable to the water treatment and polymer additive product lines which were impacted by decisions to give up low margin business and reduced demand 
sales volume in europe middle east africa increased  with acquisitions accounting for  partly offset by a decrease in base selling volume of principally in the polymer additives product line 
sales volumes in asia were up with the acquisition accounting for 
the decrease in base volumes was principally in the polymer additives product line due to decisions to give up low margin business 
sales volumes in latin america increased primarily due to improved demand for mining chemicals for copper mining applications 
selling prices increased as a result of implementation of price increase initiatives to cover significantly higher raw material and energy costs 
earnings from operations were  or of sales  compared with or of sales in earnings declined slightly as price increases of and the net favorable impact of exchange rate changes were offset by higher raw material and energy costs of  a write off of acquired in process research and development costs of  a charge of for the excess of the fair value of the finished goods inventory of the acquired business over normal manufacturing cost and lower selling volumes compounded by reduced production levels at certain facilities in response to lower demand levels 
cytec surface specialties change due to total acquistion change price volume currency north america latin america asia pacific europe middle east africa total  selling volumes increased as a result of the acquisition with base volumes decreasing slightly for heritage businesses

overall selling volumes increased 
increased sales to the europe middle east africa  north america and asia pacific regions primarily related to increased volumes to the large commercial transport and commercial rotorcraft sectors primarily due to increased build rates and new business 
earnings from operations were  or of sales  compared with  or of sales  in the increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings of from higher selling volumes and price increases of partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs of  manufacturing difficulties in europe and increased in technical  commercial and research of principally to support future growth initiatives 
building block chemicals change due to total change price volume mix currency north america latin america asia pacific europe middle east africa total due to the level of sales in this geographic region  percentage comparisons are not meaningful 
sales were higher overall due to higher selling prices  primarily for acrylonitrile  which were in line with the increase in raw material costs 
selling volumes decreased overall 
selling volumes to the asia pacific region decreased due to sluggish demand for acrylonitrile in light of higher selling prices but were partially offset by increased volumes to the europe middle east africa region where local production outages increased demand for imported acrylonitrile 
selling volumes in north america were impacted by reduced industrial demand and the hurricanes in the us gulf region 
earnings from operations were  or of sales  compared with  or of sales  in the decrease in earnings reflects the impact from the hurricanes of about related to maintenance and repair costs  extra labor and related expenses  energy and start up costs and the related lower production levels which reduced fixed cost absorption by approximately higher selling prices of mostly offset increased raw material and energy costs of year ended december  compared with year ended december  consolidated results net sales for were  compared with  during all segments reported increased sales 
in the two specialty chemicals segments sales increased primarily due to increased selling volumes  the acquisitions completed in the second half of and favorable exchange rates 
the cytec engineered materials segment sales increase was primarily volume related and all product lines participated 
the building block chemicals segment sales increased principally due to higher selling prices which were driven by higher raw material and energy costs offset somewhat by a decrease in sales volumes of acrylonitrile and acrylamide 
for a detailed discussion on sales refer to the segment results section below 
manufacturing cost of sales was  compared with  during cost of sales was primarily impacted by higher raw material and energy costs of gross margin percent however  decreased by only as the higher raw material and energy costs were offset by increased selling prices of  the net impact of exchange rates on operations outside of the united states of  the fixed cost leverage from the increased production levels and a favorable product mix 
pension expense increased principally as a result of our lowering the discount rate in the u 
s 
by to reflect current market rates on fixed income securities and by the acquisitions which increased pension expense by pension expense is primarily reported in manufacturing cost of sales 
refer to critical accounting policies  retirement plans for further discussion on how changes in discount rates and return on asset assumptions can impact annual expense 
selling and technical services was in versus in the prior year due to ongoing costs of the businesses in the specialty chemical segments acquired in the second half of  the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the united states of and higher costs in the cytec engineered materials segment of where we are investing in personnel  product qualifications and commercialization of new products for our growth initiatives 
research and process development was versus in the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of ongoing costs of the acquired businesses of the specialty chemical segments completed in the second half of  costs associated with the start up of the newly renovated specialty chemicals technology center and higher costs in the cytec engineered materials segment where we continue to invest for a number of future opportunities 
administrative and general expenses were versus in the prior year 
included in is a charge of related to the settlement of the federal carbon fiber class action lawsuit and several other minor litigation matters 
also contributing to the increase were ongoing costs of the businesses of the specialty chemical segments acquired in the second half of of approximately  an increase in deferred compensation expense of due to the increase in our stock price versus the year ago period and the impact of exchange rate changes on operations outside of the us of us additionally  we incurred in third party expenses related to implementing accounting and disclosure control procedures as required by the sarbanes oxley act of other income  net was compared with a loss of in the prior year 
included in results was a net gain of related to derivative contracts entered into during the fourth quarter to economically hedge currency and interest rate exposure associated with the pending acquisition of surface specialties 
we entered into foreign currency contracts to offset the impact of potential dollar to euro exchange rate fluctuations on the acquisition cost in dollars and this resulted in a gain of in anticipation of future long term debt that would be issued to partially finance the acquisition  we also entered into interest rate hedges which resulted in the recognition of a loss of also included in other income  net are charges of for settlement of several environmental remediation and toxic tort lawsuits and a charge of related to the settlement of a series of disputed matters with wyeth  partially offset by a gain of related to the sale in of our share of a methanol joint venture whereby we received additional proceeds because the market price of methanol stayed above an agreed upon index over a predetermined period of time 
we also recorded in other income  net  of which has been received  that relates to insurance recoveries and expected recoveries from our insurers of lead related defense costs which had been previously expensed 
lead related defense costs recognized during amounted to the prior year loss of primarily resulted from the recognition of currency losses whereby certain international subsidiaries held dollar denominated assets while the us dollar weakened 
equity in earnings of associated companies was versus in the prior year 
earnings from cyro  our owned acrylic plastics joint venture  remained flat as compared with the prior year as increased sales volumes and selling prices offset higher raw material costs 
in addition  results for included earnings of from our former owned mitsui cytec joint venture 
refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net was compared with in the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from a higher outstanding weighted average debt balance during our effective tax rate in was compared with in this reduction reflects our continued earnings growth in lower tax jurisdictions and  to a lesser extent  a favorable international tax ruling received in the first quarter of during the second quarter of  we recorded a reduction of our tax liabilities due to the completion of several years of tax audits in an international tax jurisdiction that resulted in a reduction of to our income tax provision 
these reductions were partially offset by the derivative net gain noted above which was taxed at the higher incremental us rate 
net earnings available to common stockholders for were per diluted share 
net earnings available to common stockholders for included a charge of per diluted share as a result of the redemption of our series c stock

building block chemicals change due to total change price volume mix currency north america latin america asia pacific europe middle east africa total due to the level of sales in this geographic region  percentage comparisons are not meaningful 
global sales volumes declined slightly due in part to decreased acrylonitrile production as a result of reduced propylene the key raw material for acrylonitrile availability during the first quarter as well as a scheduled plant maintenance shutdown during may  north america selling volumes were up with the majority due to increased acrylonitrile and sulfuric acid business 
europe middle east africa volumes decreased as reflected opportunistic sales in this region resulting from more favorable spot selling prices versus the asia pacific region 
north america and asia pacific selling prices were up primarily reflecting partial recovery of higher raw material and energy costs 
earnings from operations were  or of sales  compared with  or of sales  in the decrease in earnings was primarily due to the decrease in volume and increased raw material and energy costs of  which were not fully offset by price increases of liquidity and financial condition at december   our cash balance was compared with at year end this decrease was primarily attributable to the use of cash to pay for a portion of the purchase price of surface specialties and to reduce debt  partially offset by cash generated from operations and sales of assets and discontinued operations 
cash flows provided by operating activities were compared with for significant one time non cash acquisition related charges for the write off of acquired in process research and development and amortization of acquired finished goods step up to fair value negatively impacted earnings but did not impact operating cash flow 
the acquisition also resulted in significant increases in non cash depreciation and amortization expenses 
other receivables reflect cash flows of primarily due to the reimbursement from ucb for the payment of of pre acquisition tax liabilities for which we have been indemnified 
income taxes payable decreased reflecting payment of the pre acquisition income tax liabilities of and the favorable resolution of several prior year tax matters which amounted to a reduction of income taxes payable of inventories decreased reflecting efforts to optimize inventory levels 
other assets decreased primarily from the cash realization of gains on acquisition related derivative instruments that were recognized in accrued expenses decreased included in this are payments against acquisition related accruals of  payments against prior year incentive accruals higher than the current year accrual of  payment of legal settlements of of which was accrued in and a payment of for losses on interest rate derivative instruments that were recognized in partially offsetting these payments were net accruals for restructuring of cash flows used in investing activities were  for compared with for this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of surface specialties 
on february   we acquired surface specialties for cash and stock valued at  of which  euro  at us dollar per euro was paid in cash and the balance was paid in  shares of cytec common stock at per cytec share 
during september  we received from ucb representing an adjustment to the purchase price for finalization of working capital amounts as of the acquisition date 
after considering the final working capital adjustment and transaction costs of  the acquisition is valued at  of which  was paid in cash in and was paid in cash in assets acquired includes in cash  so the net cash used for the acquisition in totaled  the increase in cash flows used in investing activities was partly offset by the sale of assets of of which was received from the sale of our investment in cyro 
also  was received from the sale of ssar  which was classified as a discontinued operation 
capital spending for was  up from primarily due to spending at acquired sites 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were in compared with net cash flows used in financing activities of during this increase primarily resulted from borrowings in connection with the acquisition of surface specialties 
we financed the cash component with under an unsecured day credit facility  under an unsecured five year term loan and the remaining was paid from existing cash 
during october  we sold principal amount of notes due october  and principal amount of notes due october  collectively  the notes 
the notes were offered under our shelf registration statement 
we received in net proceeds from the offering after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses which we used to repay all amounts outstanding under our unsecured day facility and our revolving credit facility which were and  respectively 
the day facility is now terminated 
the notes will pay interest on each april and october  commencing on april  through their respective due dates 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to any secured indebtedness of cytec 
the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at our option at any time subject to a prepayment adjustment 
our bank agreements contain certain customary covenants with which we are in compliance at december  in late  we entered into of forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge the benchmark interest rate and credit spread on certain debt anticipated to be issued in in connection with the acquisition of surface specialties 
due to a subsequent reduction in borrowing requirements  we liquidated of these swaps in march at a cost of and of these swaps in june at a cost of on september   we settled the remaining outstanding swaps at the same time that we priced our public debt offering 
the termination payment of was paid in october  in connection with the acquisition  we suspended our stock buy back program and do not anticipate making future stock buy backs for at least two years from the closing date in order to maximize the funds available for debt service and other corporate purposes 
in order to take advantage of interest rates then in effect  we elected to redeem the mopprs in may   at the optional redemption price of the optional redemption price represented the principal amount of the securities and a pre tax interest charge for redemption prior to their final maturity 
the redemption provided us with the ability to refinance this debt at a significantly lower cost and a shorter tenor 
in conjunction with our note offering  we entered into euro of five year and euro of ten year euro us dollar cross currency swaps 
the swaps included an initial exchange of on october  and will require final principal exchanges of on each settlement date of the year and year notes october  and october   respectively 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us dollars to counterparties and received euros 
upon final exchange  we will provide euros to counterparties and receive us dollars 
the swaps also call for an exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed us dollar interest receipts 
with respect to the five year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity 
with respect to the ten year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date 
after accounting for the cross currency swaps  the all in effective interest rate including amortization of underwriters discount and other offering costs is approximately and for the year and year notes  respectively 
the euro denominated bank borrowings including the impact of our euro us dollar cross currency swaps  naturally hedge our euro denominated intercompany receivables and provide a partial hedge of our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
as of december   our total debt of  is denominated approximately in euros  in dollars and the balance denominated in various other currencies  after taking into account the euro us dollar cross currency swaps 
as of december   we may borrow up to under our revolving credit facility 
during  we paid four quarterly cash dividends of per common share which aggregated on february  the board of directors declared a per common share cash dividend  payable on march  to shareholders of record as of february  we believe that we have the ability to fund our operating cash requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividends as well as the ability to meet our debt service requirements for the foreseeable future from existing cash and from internal cash generation 
however  from time to time  based on such factors as local tax regulations  prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments  it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet those cash requirements  which may include debt service related disbursements 
we have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company 
excluding the impact of increasing raw materials costs  inflation is not considered significant since the rate of inflation has remained relatively low in recent years and investments in areas of the world where inflation poses a significant risk are limited 
the impact of increasing raw material costs are discussed under customers and suppliers in business in item  herein 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  operating leases purchase obligations unfunded employee benefits total  we had net contractual commitments under currency forward contracts in us dollar equivalent amounts of  that all settle in less than one year 
at december   we also had of natural gas forward contracts that settle in less than one year 
refer to item a as well as note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
we had of outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and bank guarantees at december  that are issued on our behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain of our performance obligations and commitments 
the instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis 
we do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
currencies are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk we periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net contractual amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into u 
s 
dollar equivalent amounts were as follows buy pound canadian australian sell euro sterling dollar dollar us dollar u 
s 
dollar euro norwegian krone japanese yen other the fair value of currency contracts  based on forward exchange rates at december   was approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would decrease by approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
in september   we entered into euro of five year cross currency swaps and euro of ten year cross currency swaps to effectively convert the year notes and year notes into euro denominated liabilities 
the swaps included an initial exchange of on october  and will require final principal exchanges of on each settlement date of the year and year notes october  and october   respectively 
at the initial principal exchange  we paid us dollars to counterparties and received euros 
upon final exchange  we will provide euros to counterparties and receive us dollars 
the swaps also call for a semi annual exchange of fixed euro interest payments for fixed us dollar interest receipts 
with respect to the five year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the five year swaps 
with respect to the ten year swaps  we will receive per annum and will pay per annum on each april and october  through the maturity date of the ten year swaps 
the cross currency swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the changes in value of the future euro interest and principal receipts that results from changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with our subsidiaries 
the cross currency swaps plus the euro denominated bank borrowings naturally hedge our euro denominated intercompany loans receivable and  further  provide a partial hedge of our net investment in our belgium based subsidiary  cytec surface specialties sa nv 
at december   the fair value of the five and ten year swaps were and  respectively 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the euro exchange rate would cause an increase decrease of approximately in the value of the hedging instruments referred to above 
commodity price risk we use natural gas forward contracts  which are physically settled  to hedge certain utility requirements 
the maturities of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
because we take physical delivery of the commodity  these contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
instead  realized gains and losses are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract 
at december   the building block chemicals segment fortier plant s forecasted natural gas utility requirements were hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts at an average cost of per mmbtu 
these contracts had a notional value of and have delivery dates from january through december based on year end nymex prices  we had net unrealized gains on our natural gas forward contracts at december  of assuming that year end natural gas prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the value of these contracts would decrease by approximately at december  and  we had outstanding natural gas swaps with a fair value gain of and a fair value loss of  net of taxes  respectively 
interest rate risk at december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of of short term borrowings and long term debt  including the current portion  which had a carrying value of  a face value of  and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately  assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the weighted average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense would increase decrease by approximately for the next fiscal quarter and the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease increase by approximately outlook in our february  press release  which was also furnished as an exhibit to a current report on form k  we set forth our assumptions and management s best estimate of the full year earnings at the time based on various assumptions set forth in our press release 
we forecast diluted earnings per share in the range of  before special items  for the year 
there can be no assurance that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected 
actual results may differ materially 
see comments on forward looking statements 
significant accounting estimates critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation  and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environment remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
probable insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are accrued when the related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets 
retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
our most significant pension plans are in the u 
s  and constituted over of our consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
we discounted our us future pension liabilities using a rate of at december  the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets  which was for  reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
we establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
the u 
s 
pension plan s investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
impairment of goodwill we have defined our segments as our sfas no 
reporting units 
our four business segments are cytec performance chemicals  cytec surface specialties  cytec engineered materials and building block chemicals 
cytec performance chemicals and cytec surface specialties are managed under one executive leadership  and are referred to collectively as cytec specialty chemicals 
cytec performance chemicals serves large  global industrial markets 
cytec surface specialties serves the large  global coatings market 
cytec engineered materials serves principally aerospace markets 
building block chemicals sells commodity chemical intermediates to industrial users 
the segments above reflect how we run our company  manage the assets and the customer perspective 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
we utilize a market multiple approach to determine fair value estimates 
due to the cyclical nature of our reporting units  values are determined utilizing a three year average 
the three year period is comprised of the prior year  current year and one year projected amounts 
if the market multiple approach yields a result  which may indicate a possible impairment  a discounted cash flow approach is utilized to more precisely determine the reporting unit s fair value 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets and intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries 
accordingly  no provision has been made for us or additional us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believes that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
we continually evaluate our tax contingency accruals and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution 
our tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable 
acquisitions we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business after the completion of the acquisition 
the cost to acquire a business  including transaction costs  is allocated to the underlying net assets of the acquired business in proportion to their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired in process research and development are expensed at the date of acquisition 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from third party valuation specialists 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our results of operations 
derivative financial instruments and commodity hedging activities financial instruments reflected in the consolidated balance sheets are recorded at cost which approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  certain other assets  accounts payable  and certain other liabilities 
fair values are determined through a combination of management estimates and information obtained from third parties using the latest available market data 
long term debt is carried at amortized cost 
we use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates  certain commodity eg  natural gas prices  interest rates and equity prices 
derivative instruments currently utilized include currency forward contracts and swaps  natural gas forward contracts and swaps  cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
we periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business 
the principal transactions hedged involve accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
currency forward contracts are reported as either assets or liabilities with changes in their fair value recorded in other income expense  net together with offsetting gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability 
we use cross currency swaps to synthetically convert some of our us dollar denominated debt to hedge future cash flows from euro interest and principal receipts on certain euro denominated intercompany receivables we have with our subsidiaries against changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rates 
the cross currency swaps are recorded as either assets or liabilities 
changes in fair value include both an interest and an exchange component 
the interest component is recorded in other comprehensive income while the exchange component is recorded in other income expense  net together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged intercompany receivables 
we use natural gas forward contracts  which are physically settled  to hedge certain utility requirements 
the maturities of these contracts correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that we pay for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are structured to limit our exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit we might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
because we take physical delivery of the commodity  these contracts are not required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
instead  realized gains and losses are included in the cost of the commodity upon settlement of the contract 
we also use natural gas swaps  which are financially settled  to hedge utility requirements at certain of our other facilities 
these swaps  which are highly effective at achieving offsetting cash flows of the underlying natural gas purchases  have been designated as cash flow hedges and are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  with offsetting amounts included in unrealized net losses gains on cash flow hedges on an after tax basis 
gains and losses are reclassified into earnings  as a component of manufacturing cost of sales in the period the hedged natural gas purchases affect earnings
