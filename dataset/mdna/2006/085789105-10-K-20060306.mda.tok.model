item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate strategy 
berry s mission is to increase shareholder value  primarily through increasing the net asset value and maximizing the cash flow and earnings of its assets 
the strategies to accomplish these goals include growing production and reserves from existing assets while managing expenses acquiring more light oil and natural gas assets with significant growth potential in the rocky mountain and mid continent region appraising our exploitation and exploration projects in an expedient manner investing our capital in an efficient  disciplined manner to increase production and reserves utilizing joint ventures with respected partners to enter new basins notable items in achieved record production which averaged  boe d  up from achieved record cash from operating activities of million  up from achieved record net income of million  up from developmental capital expenditures were million  up from acquired and integrated the eastern colorado niobrara natural gas producing assets acquisition cost of million added million boe of reserves before production ending at million boe achieved reserve replacement rate of negotiated new four year crude oil sales contract for california heavy oil production observed positive results on diatomite play and expanded pilot placed price collars on  barrels per day of future production from through added approximately  gross  net acres in the north dakota bakken play added approximately  gross  net acres to tri state area inventory increased quarterly dividend to

on january   we acquired certain interests in the niobrara fields in northeastern colorado for approximately million 
at december  the properties consist of approximately  gross  net acres 
production at acquisition was approximately mmcf of natural gas per day  with estimated proved reserves of bcf 
for the month of december  production averaged approximately  mmcf per day and reserves were bcf 
the acquisition included approximately miles of a pipeline gathering system and gas compression facilities for delivery into interstate gas lines 
in january  we acquired a working interest in eastern colorado  western kansas and southwestern nebraska  from an industry partner 
berry and its partner  will jointly explore and develop shallow niobrara natural gas  sharon springs shale gas and deeper pennsylvanian formation oil assets on the acreage 
we paid approximately million for our working interest in the acreage and believe the potential of the tri state area can be exploited by using new drilling techniques  with d seismic technology  to assess structural complexity  estimate potentially recoverable oil and gas and determine drilling locations 
in  we completed several transactions whereby we now have working interests in  gross acres  net located in the williston basin in north dakota 
these lease acquisitions  totaling approximately million  provide us an entry into the emerging bakken oil play in the williston basin 
the acreage covers several contiguous blocks located primarily on the eastern flank of the nesson anticline 
development activity in the middle bakken play is generally expanding to the area surrounding the nesson anticline 
in october  we purchased a working interest in approximately  gross undeveloped acres  net in colorado s phillips and sedgwick counties 
this additional niobrara leasehold position is adjacent to and immediately north of berry s producing natural gas assets in yuma county 
we expect to begin shooting a d seismic survey and drilling the first delineation wells in berry petroleum company dec

berry internally estimates there are billion cubic feet bcf of proved reserves and has identified over drilling locations based on acre development 
we will be the operator in the  gross acres targeting gas in the williams fork section of the mesaverde formation 
we increased the capital budget by an additional million to million to develop this resource 
there are two drilling rigs dedicated to this project  and we will ramp up our drilling activity to four rigs by the end of the year along with complementary services and goods to accelerate the development of this acquisition 
based on the productivity of this acreage and surrounding producing operations  we are seeking to add additional drilling rigs to accelerate development 
the transaction closed on february  capital expenditures 
excluding any future acquisitions  in we plan to spend approximately million 
these expenditures will be directed toward developing reserves  increasing oil and gas production and exploration opportunities 
for  berry plans to invest approximately million  or  in our rocky mountain and mid continent region assets  and million  or  in our california assets 
approximately half the capital budget is focused on converting probable and possible reserves into proved reserves and on our appraisal and exploratory projects 
this robust capital program allows berry to continue its record activity levels by planning to drill net wells and perform well workover activities in versus approximately wells and well workovers in as a result  we are targeting production growth of to average approximately  boe per day  which includes the piceance basin acquisition  but before any other acquisitions  and we plan to continue to actively appraise significant acreage positions held for hydrocarbon potential 
in  we expect production to be approximately heavy oil  light oil and natural gas and anticipate funding our capital program from internally generated cash flow 
successes may also encourage the initiation of additional discretionary projects 
we have currently secured the necessary equipment and are meeting permit requirements to achieve the program 
appraisal  evaluation and exploitation activity 
since  we have been active in assembling significant acreage positions which we believe are highly prospective for finding and developing commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
this chart depicts our prospective acreage by basin  all of which is in the rocky mountain and mid continent region rocky mountain and mid continent we plan to appraise five project areas in this region in for an estimated million budgeted 
these five projects are lake canyon  coyote flats  big wash unit  tri state area and the bakken play 
we have interests in over one million gross acres  including both productive and prospective  in the rocky mountain and mid continent region and the acreage in the five appraisal projects accounts for about of that total

initial performance from these discovery wells suggests that expected reserves per well are on par with the brundage canyon field approximately  boe gross that is currently being developed on acre spacing 
current production from the taylor herrick well is not at full capacity as additional facilities are in the process of being installed 
production from the nielsen marsing well is selectively limited to two of five completion intervals within the well and will be further optimized by march when natural gas facilities are completed 
we are proceeding with another four wells on the eastern edge of this  acre block 
if the results of these wells are deemed satisfactory  berry will expand the drilling program and attempt to drill up to another wells over approximately  acres 
the focus will be to begin the methodical appraisal of a sizeable portion of this acreage block

results are in accordance with expectations 
we are judiciously monitoring the steam to oil ratio sor because we believe achieving an sor of or less is the threshold for commerciality 
sor measures how much steam is required for injection into the reservoir to produce one barrel of oil 
estimated original oil in place ranges between million to million barrels with targets of a minimum recovery of original oil in place

obstacles and risks to accomplishment of strategies and goals 
see item a other factors affecting the company s business and financial results for a detailed discussion of factors that affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations 
approximately of berry s revenues are generated through the sale of oil and natural gas production under either negotiated contracts or spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
over of these volumes are from oil production  and the majority of those volumes are from heavy oil production in california 
the remaining of berry s revenues are derived from electricity sales from cogeneration facilities which supply over half of berry s steam requirement for use in its california thermal heavy oil operations 
we have invested in these facilities for the purpose of lowering our steam costs which are significant in the production of heavy crude oil 
revenues 
sales of oil and gas were up in compared to and up from this significant improvement was due to increases in both oil and gas prices and production levels 
improvements in production volume are due to acquisitions and sizable capital investments 
improvement in prices during are due to a tighter supply and demand balance and the nervousness of the market about possible supply disruptions 
the increase in oil prices contributed roughly two thirds of the revenue increase and the increase in production volumes contributed the other third 
approximately of berry s oil and gas sales volumes in were crude oil  with of the crude oil being heavy oil produced in california which was sold under a contract based on the higher of wti minus a fixed differential or the average posted price plus a premium 
this contract ended on january  the contract allowed us to improve our california revenues over the posted price by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
on november   we entered into a new crude oil sales contract for our california production for deliveries beginning february  the per barrel price  calculated on a monthly basis and blended across the various producing locations  is the higher of the wti nymex crude oil price less a fixed differential approximating  or heavy oil field postings plus a premium of approximately 
the initial term of the contract is for four years with a one year renewal at our option 
the agreement effectively eliminates our exposure to the risk of a widening wti to california heavy crude price differential and allows us to effectively hedge our production based on wti pricing similar to the previous contract 
initial deliveries under the contract are approximately  net barrels per day or approximately two thirds of berry s total production 
brundage canyon crude oil production  which is approximately degree api gravity  is sold under contract at wti less a fixed differential approximating per barrel 
this contract expires on september  any new contract will be negotiated based on market prices 
we believe the differential has widened by several dollars per barrel 
the majority of this crude oil  while light  is a paraffinic crude  and can be processed efficiently by only a limited number of stranded inland refineries 
the production of this type crude is increasing regionally and beginning to strain the capacity of these refineries 
other new crude sources from the region are pressuring pricing 
if these refineries limit the volumes of this parraffinic crude oil they are willing to process  it could impact the marketability of this type of crude which  for berry  represents approximately  bbl d of production or approximately of total current production 
we are investigating the market opportunities for this crude oil 
if market prices continue to deteriorate  we may allocate capital expenditures to projects which produce natural gas and crude oils with lower paraffinic content until the refinery constraint is resolved

the reserve replacement rate is calculated by dividing total new proved reserves added for the year by total production for the year 
this measure is important because it is an indication of growth in proved reserves of the company and  thus may impact the value of the company

berry consumes natural gas as fuel to operate its three cogeneration facilities which are intended to provide an efficient and secure long term supply of steam necessary for the economic production of heavy oil 
we sell our electricity to utilities under standard offer contracts  under which our revenues are linked to the cost of natural gas 
natural gas index prices are the primary determinant of berry s electricity sales price 
the correlation between electricity sales and natural gas prices allows us to more effectively manage our cost of producing steam

income taxes 
the revenue reconciliation act of included a tax credit for certain costs associated with extracting high cost  capital intensive marginal oil or gas and which utilizes at least one of nine designated enhanced or tertiary recovery methods eor 
cyclic steam and steam flood recovery methods for heavy oil  which berry utilizes extensively  are qualifying eor methods 
in  california conformed to the federal law  thus  on a combined basis  we are able to achieve credits approximating of our qualifying costs 
the credit is earned only for qualified eor projects by investing in one of three types of expenditures drilling development wells  adding facilities that are integrally related to qualified eor production  or utilizing a tertiary injectant  such as steam  to produce oil 
the credit may be utilized to reduce our tax liability down to  but not below  our alternative minimum tax liability 
this credit has been significant through in reducing our income tax liabilities and effective tax rate 
however  with higher crude oil prices and the increasing investment in its light crude oil and natural gas properties  berry s effective income tax rate trended higher in compared to prior years 
the average us wellhead price for crude oil exceeded in  thus triggering a full phase out of the eor credit for if the us wellhead price of crude oil declines below the triggering point in future years  we will be able to claim the eor credit on qualifying expenditures and our effective tax rate should decline 
as of december  the company has approximately million of federal and million of state california eor tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future income taxes 
the eor credits will begin to expire  if unused  in and for federal and california  respectively 
we experienced an effective tax rate of  and reported in  and  respectively 
the increase in effective tax rate during is primarily due to a much higher over pre tax income in relation to consistent eor credits in over our expansion outside of california and investment in non thermal projects are also key factors in the increase 
we have been able to achieve an effective tax rate below the statutory tax rate of approximately through primarily as a result of significant eor tax credits earned by our continued investment in the development of thermal eor projects  both through capital expenditures and continued steam injection

the net long term growth in our cash flow from operating activities is the result of growth in production as affected by period to period fluctuations in commodity prices

application of critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical policies 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company accounts for its oil and gas exploration and development costs using the successful efforts method 
geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred 
exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found 
if economically recoverable reserves are not found  exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes 
all exploratory wells are evaluated for economic viability within one year of well completion 
exploratory wells that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a major capital expenditure would be required before production could begin  and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the area  remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is under way or firmly planned 
oil and gas reserves 
oil and gas reserves include proved reserves that represent estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the company s oil and gas reserves are based on estimates prepared by independent engineering consultants 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that requires judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
projected future production rates  the timing of future capital expenditures as well as changes in commodity prices may significantly impact estimated reserve quantities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense and impairment of proved properties are impacted by the company s estimation of proved reserves 
these estimates are subject to change as additional information and technologies become available 
accordingly  oil and natural gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different than projected 
reduction in reserve estimates may result in increased dd a expense  increased impairment of proved properties and a lower standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
carrying value of long lived assets 
downward revisions in the company s estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil or natural gas prices could cause the company to reduce the carrying amounts of its properties 
the company performs an impairment analysis of its proved properties annually by comparing the future undiscounted net revenue per the annual reserve valuation prepared by the company s independent reserve engineers to the net book carrying value of the assets 
an analysis of the proved properties will also be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable from future net revenue 
assets are grouped at the field level and if it is determined that the net book carrying value cannot be recovered by the estimated future undiscounted cash flow  they are written down to fair value 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based on management s estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves  future crude oil and natural gas prices in effect at the end of the period and costs to extract these reserves 
for its unproved properties  the company performs an impairment analysis annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s net book carrying value may not be recoverable 
derivatives and hedging 
the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires the accounting recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income 
under the provisions of sfas  the company may designate a derivative instrument as hedging the exposure to change in fair value of an asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk a fair value hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to a particular risk a cash flow hedge 
both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis  a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk during the periods that a hedge is designated 
similarly  a cash flow hedge must be expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge 
the expectation of hedge effectiveness must be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset  liability or forecasted transaction to the berry petroleum company dec

table of contents derivative contract or by effectiveness assessments using statistical measurements 
the company s policy is to assess hedge effectiveness at the end of each calendar quarter 
income taxes 
the company computes income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the company s financial statements 
this difference will result in taxable income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset is more likely than not 
additionally  the company s federal and state income tax returns are generally not filed before the financial statements are prepared  therefore the company estimates the tax basis of its assets and liabilities at the end of each calendar year as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods 
adjustments related to differences between the estimates used and actual amounts reported are recorded in the period in which income tax returns are filed 
these adjustments and changes in estimates of asset recovery could have an impact on results of operations 
the company may generate enhanced oil recovery tax credits from the production of its heavy crude oil in california which results in a deferred tax asset and believes that these credits will be fully utilized in future years and consequently has not recorded any valuation allowance related to these credits 
due to uncertainties involved with tax matters  the future effective tax rate may vary significantly from the estimated current year effective tax rate 
asset retirement obligations 
the company has significant obligations to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related equipment at the end of oil and gas production operations 
the computation of the company s asset retirement obligations aro was prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the company to record the fair value of liabilities for retirement obligations of long lived assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
in resulted in an immaterial difference in the liability that had been previously recorded by the company 
estimating the future aro requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  as well as what constitutes adequate remediation 
the company obtained estimates from third parties and used the present value of estimated cash flows related to its aro to determine the fair value 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated aro 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the related asset 
due to the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of the company s assets  the costs to ultimately retire the company s wells may vary significantly from previous estimates 
environmental remediation liability 
the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  its estimates of costs of the cleanup of various sites including sites in which governmental agencies have designated the company as a potentially responsible party 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and where a minimum cost or a reasonable estimate of the cost of remediation can be determined  the applicable amount is accrued 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is an estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisers  the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators or courts of law  the experience of the company and other companies in dealing with similar matters and the decision of management on how it intends to respond to a particular matter 
a change in estimate could impact the company s oil and gas operating costs and the liability  if applicable  recorded on the company s balance sheet 
accounting for business combinations 
the company has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available

table of contents each of the business combinations completed were of interests in oil and gas assets 
we believe the consideration we paid to acquire these assets represents the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations  nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company voluntarily adopted the fair value method of accounting for its stock option plan as prescribed by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
the modified prospective method was selected as described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under this method  the company recognizes stock option compensation expense as if it had applied the fair value method to account for unvested stock options from its original effective date 
stock option compensation expense is recognized from the date of grant to the vesting date 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options granted is based on historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  the range results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of grant 
electricity cost allocation 
the company s investment in its cogeneration facilities has been for the express purpose of lowering steam costs in its california heavy oil operations and securing operating control of the respective steam generation 
such cogeneration operations produce electricity and steam and use natural gas as fuel 
the company allocates steam costs to its oil and gas operating costs based on the conversion efficiency of fuel to electricity and steam of the cogeneration facilities plus certain direct costs in producing steam 
electricity revenue represents sales to the utilities 
electricity used in oil and gas operations is allocated at cost 
a portion of the dd a expenses associated with capital is allocated to dd a oil and gas production 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  sfas no

fin clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the company 
fin states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable 
fin is intended to provide more information about long lived assets and future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities and is effective for the fiscal year end december  the adoption of fin by the company did not have an immediate affect on the financial statements 
on april  the fasb adopted fasb staff position fsp fsp accounting for suspended well costs that amends sfas  financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  to permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
in accordance with the guidance in the fsp  the company applied the requirements prospectively in its second quarter of the adoption of fsp by the company did not have an immediate effect on the financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed in note to the financial statements  to minimize the effect of a downturn in oil and gas prices and protect the profitability of the company and the economics of the company s development plans  from time to time the company enters into crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts 
the terms of contracts depend on various factors  including management s view of future crude oil and natural gas prices and the company s future financial commitments 
this price hedging program is designed to moderate the effects of a severe crude oil and natural gas price downturn while allowing berry to participate in the upside 
in california  berry benefits from lower natural gas pricing and elsewhere  berry benefits from higher natural gas pricing 
the company has  and may hedge both natural gas purchases and sales as determined appropriate by management 
management regularly monitors the crude oil and natural gas markets and the company s financial commitments to determine if  when  and at what level some form of crude oil and or natural gas hedging or other price protection is appropriate in accordance with board established policy 
currently  the company s hedges are in the form of swaps and collars 
however  the company may use a variety of hedge instruments in the future to hedge wti or the index gas price 
the company has crude oil sales contracts in place  which are priced based on a correlation to wti 
natural gas for cogeneration and conventional steaming operations is purchased at the socal border price and the company sells its produced gas in colorado and utah at the colorado interstate gas cig and questar index prices  respectively 
the following table summarizes the hedge position of the company as of december  average average barrels average mmbtu average term per day price term per day price crude oil sales nymex wti natural gas sales cig swaps swaps st quarter st quarter nd quarter rd quarter natural gas purchases socal border collars floor ceiling prices swaps st through rd quarter st quarter th quarter nd quarter full year full year full year berry petroleum company dec

conversely  payments from our counterparties are received when the monthly average prices are below the swap price for the company s crude oil and natural gas sales hedges and above the swap price for the company s natural gas purchase hedge positions 
the collar strike prices will allow the company to protect a significant portion of its future cash flow if oil prices decline below per barrel while still participating in any oil price increase up to per barrel on these volumes and if gas prices decline below approximately per mmbtu 
these hedges improve the company s financial flexibility by locking in significant revenues and cash flow upon a substantial decline in crude oil or natural gas prices 
it also allows the company to develop its long lived assets and pursue exploitation opportunities with greater confidence in the projected economic outcomes and allows the company to borrow a higher amount under the credit facility 
while the company has designated its hedges as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  it is possible that a portion of the hedge related to the movement in the wti to california heavy crude oil price differential may be determined to be ineffective 
likewise  the company may have some ineffectiveness in its natural gas hedges put into place on march   due to the movement of hh pricing as compared to actual sales points 
if this occurs  the ineffective portion will directly impact net income rather than being reported as other comprehensive income 
while management believes that the differential will narrow and move closer toward its historical level over time  there are no assurances as to the movement in the differential 
if the differential were to change significantly  it is possible that the company s hedges  when marked to market  could have a material impact on earnings in any given quarter and  thus  add increased volatility to the company s net income 
the marked to market values reflect the liquidation values of such hedges and not necessarily the values of the hedges if they are held to maturity 
irrespective of the unrealized gains reflected in other comprehensive income  the ultimate impact to net income over the life of the hedges will reflect the actual settlement values 
all of these hedges have historically been deemed to be cash flow hedges with the marked to market valuations provided by external sources  based on prices that are actually quoted 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes  consisted of million of unrealized losses from the company s crude oil and natural gas hedges 
deferred net losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december  are expected to be reclassified to earnings through for the company s swaps and at current prices the company s collars are not expected to impact earnings

the initial term of the contract is for four years with a one year renewal at the company s option 
the company has redesignated its existing crude oil collars as cash flow hedges related to california crude oil production  and there was no related effect to other comprehensive income with regard to this redesignation 
pricing in the existing crude oil sales agreement at brundage canyon is based upon average weekly wti minus a fixed differential of approximately per barrel through september  any new contract will be negotiated based on market prices 
upon the expiration of these crude oil contracts  and absent any new contracts  the company will be exposed to fluctuations in the basis differentials between wti and the posted price for its crude oil at its various producing locations until new contracts which lock in such differential can be obtained 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
with respect to the company s hedging activities  the company utilizes multiple counterparties on its hedges and monitors each counterparty s credit rating 
the company also attempts to minimize credit exposure to counterparties through diversification
