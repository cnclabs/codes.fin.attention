on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information

the increase in retail sales growth for fiscal compared to fiscal can be attributed to increased advertising effectiveness  due to a more favorable advertising environment  with more effective creative  and discount offers 
there can be no assurances that this trend will continue due to increased price competition from veterinarians and traditional and online retailers 
the majority of our product sales are affected by the seasons  due to the seasonality of mainly heartworm and flea and tick medications

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  line of credit  and debt obligations 
the book values of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
at march   we had no debt obligations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our obligations under our line of credit  which was not renewed in fiscal the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in revenue volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above
