item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data overview our corporate office and production facility are located in batavia  new york 
our most recently completed fiscal year  which we refer to as fiscal  began on april  and ended on march  we are a designer  manufacturer and worldwide supplier of ejectors  pumps  condensers and heat exchangers 
the principal markets for our equipment are the petrochemical  oil refinery and electric power generation industries  including cogeneration and geothermal plants 
our equipment can also be found in diverse applications such as metal refining  pulp and paper processing  shipbuilding  water heating  refrigeration  desalination  food processing  drugs  heating  ventilating and air conditioning 
the current level of inquiries for our products and services gives us reason to believe that we continue to be in a period of increased capital spending by customers and potential customers 
we believe that such increased capital spending will continue to positively impact our business for the immediate future 
global growth and expansion in oil refineries  petrochemical plants and power generation facilities are driving current demand for our products and services 
because our products are capital goods  industrial downturns can have a material adverse impact on sales 
in may  we disposed of our subsidiary located in the united kingdom that manufactured vacuum pumps 
this disposition is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of operations and retained earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of fiscal and fiscal highlights highlights for fiscal sales for the year were up compared with fiscal backlog increased compared with fiscal income from continuing operations and income per diluted share for fiscal were  and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for fiscal gross profit margins and operating margins from continuing operations were and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for fiscal effective october  we split our stock for to achieve greater trading liquidity 
in november  the sale of  shares of common stock  which we previously held as treasury shares  was completed resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in january  the position of vice president of asia operations was established for the purpose of developing and implementing marketing  manufacturing and engineering strategic growth opportunities in asia 
in may  we completed the formation of a wholly owned chinese subsidiary located in suzhou  which currently is a sales  engineering and project management operation  and committed to a  capital investment over the next two years 
we believe the principal market drivers that are increasing capital spending and contributing to our sales growth include global consumption of crude oil is estimated to expand significantly over the next years 
it is generally believed that there is a shortage of global oil refining capacity 
there is a significant differential in raw material prices for higher quality sweet and lower quality sour crude oil 
to lower production costs  many refineries are upgrading facilities in order to be able to process sour crude oil  which requires an upgrade of vacuum and heat transfer equipment 

table of contents known supplies of sweet crude oil are being depleted 
sour crude sources are identified and believed to be plentiful 
new environmental regulations in numerous countries requiring lower sulfur emissions are requiring refineries to upgrade their facilities 
the expansion of the middle class in asia is driving increasing demand for power and petrochemical products 
the high cost of natural gas in north america and europe is leading to the construction of new petrochemical plants in the middle east  where natural gas is plentiful and inexpensive 
the global economy is continuing to expand 
there is an increased need in certain regions for geothermal electrical power plants to meet increased electricity demand 
forward looking statements this report and other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from any future results implied by the forward looking statements

undue reliance should not be placed on these forward looking statements 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update or announce any revisions to forward looking statements contained in this report  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on all contracts with a planned manufacturing process in excess of four weeks which approximates direct labor hours using the percentage of completion method 
the 
table of contents percentage of completion method is determined by comparing actual labor incurred to a specific date to our estimate of the total labor to be incurred on each contract 
contracts in progress are reviewed monthly  and sales and earnings are adjusted in current accounting periods based on revisions in the contract value and estimated material and labor costs at completion 
losses on contracts are recognized immediately when known 
revenue on contracts not accounted for using the percentage of completion method is recognized utilizing the completed contract method 
the majority of the contracts we enter into have a planned manufacturing process of less than four weeks and the results reported under this method do not vary materially from the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue and all related costs on the completed contract method upon substantial completion or shipment of products to the customer 
substantial completion is consistently defined as at least complete with regard to direct labor hours 
customer acceptance is required throughout the construction process and we have no further material obligations under the contract after the revenue is recognized 
pension and postretirement benefits 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
we base the discount rate assumption for our plans on moody s or citigroup pension liability index aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the plan s asset allocation  historical returns and expectations as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
to the extent that actual results differ from assumptions  the differences are reflected as unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service period of the plan participants to the extent such total net recognized gains and losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market related value of assets 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would affect pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax rates 
we evaluate available information about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred income tax assets and record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that represents our best estimates of the amounts of such deferred income tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended march  net sales income loss from continuing operations diluted income loss per share from continuing operations identifiable assets 
table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  a increase  as compared with  for fiscal sixty seven percent of the growth in sales came from greater export sales 
fifty six percent of the increase in export sales came from sales to the middle east and were mostly for petrochemical projects 
increases in sales to canada for refinery and tar sands projects ie  projects involving a process whereby tar like sludgy heavy oil is extracted from sand  asia for petrochemical projects and mexico for refinery applications account for the remainder of the growth in export sales 
by product  condenser sales for fiscal increased over the fiscal and ejector sales increased 
increased sales of condenser products were mostly a result of capacity expansion projects in the petrochemical market 
increased ejector sales were primarily a result of oil refinery upgrade and expansion activities 
the latter activity is largely due to the growing utilization of lower quality sour crude oil instead of higher quality sweet crude oil as the core raw material for refinery processes as well as compliance with new environmental regulations in numerous countries related to clean fuels and capacity additions 
increase in capacity in the petrochemical sector is being driven by greater worldwide demand for  and consumption of  oil and natural gas by products 
see orders and backlog 
gross profit percentage for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin in fiscal was due to greater sales volume as well as selling price increases 
we were able to obtain greater volume and higher selling prices and at the same time be more selective in orders accepted as a result of improved product demand 
we anticipate pressure on gross margin will increase in the future because of increasing materials  energy  labor and benefits costs 
in addition  given the sales opportunities we believe exist in asia and elsewhere  we have strategically increased our emphasis in those markets 
although we believe that such markets are likely to have lower margin potential because of their specific economic climates  we believe that the expansion of our operations into these markets will provide long term benefits  including geographic proximity to our customers in asia 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales for fiscal  as compared with for fiscal actual expenses for fiscal increased or  compared with fiscal  primarily as a result of increased travel for sales activities  variable compensation expense relating to greater income from continuing operations  the addition of sales personnel in europe and china to support long term sales growth opportunities and consulting costs for employee training and sarbanes oxley preparation costs 
there was no other income for fiscal other income of  for fiscal resulted from a settlement of a contract dispute over cancellation charges 
the settlement of this matter ended a complaint we filed in april in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging breach of contract by a customer and a counterclaim filed by the customer seeking specific performance of the contract or monetary damages 
other expense for fiscal was this expense was incurred in conjunction with the settlement of litigation whereby we sued a foreign pump competitor that had adopted the name graham 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  such competitor agreed to discontinue using our name by the fall of in exchange for certain inventory items with a recorded amount plus packaging costs of we incurred in legal costs pertaining to this settlement 
other expense in fiscal of  related to transitioning two senior executives 
under the terms of an agreement reached with our former president and chief executive officer  he was retained by us as an independent consultant through november  for an estimated cost  including retainer and certain benefits  of another senior executive was transitioned in january the term of the agreement reached with this former executive included salary continuation for twelve months and certain medical benefits for thirty six months  for an estimated cost of costs accrued as of march  to recruit and relocate executive replacements for such transitioned senior executives resulted in of expense 
interest expense was for fiscal and for fiscal year interest expense decreased due to reduced bank borrowings 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was  as compared with for fiscal fiscal year s rate approximated the statutory rate 
the low effective rate for fiscal was due to lower net income 
table of contents coupled with an exclusion of income on export sales permitted under us tax law together with the minimal amount of income subject to income taxes for the period

this compares with income from continuing operations of  or per diluted share for fiscal loss from discontinued operations and loss per diluted share was  and  respectively  for fiscal net loss and loss per diluted share for fiscal was  and  respectively 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal were  up  as compared with  for fiscal the increase in sales for fiscal was due to increased ejector and condenser sales and from one petrochemical vacuum system shipment that approximated of annual sales 
sales for the last six months of fiscal were up over the same period in fiscal sales for the last six months of fiscal were up from the first half of such year 
the increase in sales in the last half of fiscal was due to the early stages of recovery in the refinery and petrochemical markets 
gross profit percentage for fiscal was  as compared with for fiscal the improvement in gross profit percentage for fiscal compared with fiscal was due to greater sales volume and lower plant utility  repair and maintenance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales for fiscal  as compared with for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were down in fiscal due to a reduction in sales commission rates and lower advertising and travel expenses 
interest expense was for fiscal and for fiscal year interest expense decreased due to reduced bank borrowings 
other income for fiscal was  as compared with for fiscal fiscal other income is described above 
other income of  recognized for fiscal  represents a non recurring curtailment gain resulting from the discontinuation of postretirement medical benefits 
other expense recognized for fiscal of  was substantially incurred in conjunction with transitioning two senior executives  as described above 
there was no other expense for fiscal the effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal was  as compared to a benefit of for fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was due to a partial exclusion permitted under us tax law of income on export sales 
the benefit for income taxes recognized for fiscal was greater than the statutory tax rate due to our termination of split dollar life insurance policies and distribution of the proceeds from such policies to the respective employees in october income from continuing operations for fiscal was or per diluted share 
this compares to a loss from continuing operations of or per diluted share for fiscal we incurred a net loss in fiscal of  or per diluted share after recognition of the loss from discontinued operations for our uk subsidiaries of  this compares to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for fiscal  after recognition of the loss from uk discontinued operations of stockholders equity fy fy fy fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity increased  or for fiscal compared with fiscal in dollars and by percentages  this increase resulted from net income of   the sale of treasury stock which resulted in additional equity of   the issuance of common stock relating to options exercised which resulted in 
table of contents increased equity of  and the reversal of the minimum pension liability that increased equity by  due to contributions made to the plan in fiscal approximately of the increase was returned to our stockholders in dividends 
net book value per share increased to compared with as of march  fiscal compared with fiscal stockholders equity decreased  or for fiscal compared with fiscal due to the disposal of our uk operations loss from discontinued operations of  less gain in foreign currency translation of  resulting in a net of 
in addition  an increase to the minimum pension liability adjustment and an increase in dividends paid to stockholders further contributed to the decrease in equity 
this decrease in equity was partially offset by net income from continuing operations and the issuance of common stock relating to the exercise of stock options 
net book value per share decreased to compared with as of march  liquidity and capital resources march  working capital working capital ratio long term debt long term debt capitalization long term liabilities capitalization working capital ratio equals current assets divided by current liabilities 
long term debt capitalization equals long term debt divided by stockholders equity plus long term debt

amounts represent anticipated contributions to the defined benefit pension plan and postretirement medical benefit plan for our fiscal year ending march  the company expects to be required to make cash contributions beyond one year 
fiscal compared with fiscal net cash provided by continuing operating activities was  for fiscal compared with net cash used by operating activities of  for fiscal the change from cash used by operations to cash provided by operations was primarily due to net income of  for fiscal compared with a net income from continuing operations of for fiscal  a non cash tax provision of  and the reduction of trade accounts receivable 
table of contents during we have been able to accelerate cash collections on trade accounts receivable through various initiatives implemented in fiscal during fiscal year  net cash generated in excess of cash held for near term needs was invested in marketable securities 
investments in marketable securities generally consist of us government instruments with maturity periods of to days 
investments at march  increased  over investments at march  investments decreased  from march  to march  the decrease in the prior year period was due to the sale of marketable securities to finance an operating cash deficit 
other investing activities for fiscal included the purchase of plant and office equipment of  including computer hardware and capitalized software of this compares with plant and office equipment purchased in fiscal of increased capital spending in fiscal compared with fiscal was incurred to increase engineering capacities and reduce operating cycle times 
this trend is anticipated to continue in fiscal the sale of  shares of common stock was completed by us in november the shares were offered for per share pursuant to an effective registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
these shares had been held as treasury shares before their sale and had been previously acquired by us at an average price of per share 
in total  the sale netted  after related costs of and increased stockholders equity  resulting in a net book value per share increase of 
the shares were sold to raise additional working capital to support sales growth  diversify our stockholder base  broaden institutional ownership and provide greater public float 
cash of  was generated from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options during fiscal year this compares with generated from the exercise of stock options in fiscal our average trading stock price for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal  which we believe led to the increased activity of exercising stock options 
other financing activities in fiscal year included the retirement of  in short term debt 
we have a credit facility with bank of america  na for  borrowings under which are secured by all of our assets 
we believe that cash generated from operations combined with investments and available financing capacity under this credit facility will be adequate to meet our cash needs  including planned capital spending  for the immediate future 
as of march  we had standby letters of credit outstanding of  and no borrowings 
as of march  the interest rate charged for borrowings under the terms of the facility would be prime minus basis points or there were no discontinued operation activities in fiscal total cash used by the discontinued operation in the uk for fiscal was orders and backlog orders for fiscal were  compared with  for fiscal  a increase 
orders represent communications received from customers for the supply of products and services 
we believe orders are a very important indicator of our future business prospects 
the increase in orders was primarily due to increased orders for condensers and ejectors 
compared with fiscal  orders for surface condensers increased and ejector orders increased 
increased condenser and ejector orders were due to the increased demand in major project work in the petrochemical and refinery sectors 
export orders were up for fiscal eighty percent of this increase was for orders for the middle east and largely pertained to petrochemical projects 
domestic orders increased in fiscal compared with the prior fiscal year 
backlog was  at march   compared with  at march   a increase 
backlog is defined as the total dollar value of orders received for which revenue has not yet been recognized 
all orders in backlog represent orders from traditional markets in established product lines that are scheduled to be shipped in the next twelve months 
approximately of backlog can be attributed to equipment for refinery project work  to chemical and petrochemical projects  to equipment sold to the power generation sector and to other industrial or commercial applications 
we believe that the demand coming from the refinery sector for our products and services is being driven by the shortages of refinery capacity resulting from increased usage of oil in china and 
table of contents india  the need to upgrade existing refineries so that they can use lower cost  high sulfur sour crude  and the need to revamp refineries to meet environmental regulations in numerous countries pertaining to diesel fuel sulfur content requirements 
most refineries presently in operation are only able to process light  sweet ie  low sulfur crude  which is less abundant and more expensive than heavier sour ie  high sulfur crude 
orders from the petrochemical and power markets are mainly for foreign capacity expansion projects 
we believe that these orders reflect the continued economic growth in asia 
contingencies we have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos contained in our products 
we are a co defendant with numerous other defendants in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend against these claims 
the claims are similar to previous asbestos lawsuits that named us as a defendant 
such previous lawsuits either were dismissed when it was shown that we had not supplied products to the plaintiffs places of work or were settled for minimal amounts below expected defense costs 
neither the outcome of these lawsuits nor the potential for liability can be determined at this time 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings and potential claims 
as of march   we were unaware of any additional pending litigation matters 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of abnormal contained in such statement 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will become effective for inventory costs we incur during the fiscal year ending march  although we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
may result in the acceleration of recognizing indirect manufacturing expenses during times of below normal utilization of plant capacity  we do not anticipate below normal utilization of plant capacity in the immediate future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign currency exchange rates  equity price risk related to our long term incentive plan for directors  and gross margin risk 
the assumptions applied in preparing the following qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk are based upon volatility ranges experienced by us in relevant historical periods  our current knowledge of the marketplace  and our judgment of the probability of future volatility based upon the historical trends and economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
foreign currency international consolidated sales for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively  of total sales 
operating in markets throughout the world  as we do  exposes us to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency movements can affect our sales in several ways  the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors who base their prices on relatively weaker currencies 
business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified 
secondly  cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales in foreign currency to dollars 
in both fiscal and fiscal  we had no sales for which we were paid in foreign currencies 
at certain times  we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange agreements to hedge exposure against unfavorable changes in foreign currency values on significant sales contracts negotiated in foreign currencies 
we have limited exposure to foreign currency purchases 
for fiscal and fiscal  purchases in foreign currencies represented and  respectively  of the cost of products sold 
at certain times  we may utilize forward foreign currency exchange contracts to limit currency exposure 
at march  and  we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
equity price risk our long term incentive plan provides for awards of share equivalent units seus for outside directors based upon the performance of our common stock 
seus are valued at fair market value  thereby exposing us to equity price risk 
upward adjustment to market value is limited to a per unit if at the valuation date the fair market value was less than per unit or b the fair market value at the valuation date if the fair market value on that 
table of contents date was greater than per unit 
gains and losses recognized due to market price changes are included in results of operations 
based upon the plan provisions and seus outstanding at march  and and per share price  a change in the year end common stock market price would positively or negatively impact income from continuing operations before income taxes as follows year ended march  increase decrease increase decrease assuming required net income targets are met  certain awards would be provided  and based upon a market price of per share  a change in the stock price would positively negatively impact income from continuing operations before income taxes in future years as follows year ended march  increase decrease increase decrease gross margin risk operating in a global marketplace requires us to compete with other global manufacturers which  in some instances  benefit from lower product costs and favorable foreign exchange rates 
currently we are experiencing rising costs  particularly for healthcare  employment costs  metals and other materials and energy 
we may encounter greater pricing pressures preventing us from fully covering escalating costs 
the rapid expansion in the oil and natural gas markets is expanding our potential customer base 
this new customer base may be more cost sensitive as opposed to product value oriented 
these additional customers could lead to lower gross margins 
to mitigate these pressures  in addition to establishing a base of operations in china through the formation of a wholly owned chinese subsidiary  among other things  we are exploring alternative manufacturing models  increasing investments in information technology to improve productivity and adopting lean manufacturing principles
