item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
our most significant estimates relate to accounting for our percentage of completion and proportional performance contracts  accounts receivable reserves  inventory reserves  evaluating goodwill for impairment  the realizability and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  and contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition for our contracts with multiple elements  revenue recognition for our contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion and proportional performance methods  capitalized software development costs  acquired intangible assets  goodwill impairment  stock compensation expense  and income taxes 
we describe these accounting policies in relevant sections of this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview and recent developments our business is reported across two market segments i our commercial applications segment  which consists principally of enhanced communication services to and from wireless phones  location application software  our e application and other hosted services  and ii our government segment  which includes the design  development and deployment of information processing and communication systems and related services to government agencies 
in addition  our business includes the enterprise division  which we are currently in the process of selling  as explained below 
discontinued operations as of december   as a result of slower than anticipated market adoption of key technologies related to the enterprise assets and management s strategic decision to focus on our core technologies  we committed to a plan to sell the enterprise assets which we acquired from aether systems  inc in the plan was approved by our board of directors in december  and we engaged an investment banker that is actively marketing the enterprise assets 
we expect to complete the sale of these assets by the end of accordingly  the assets  liabilities  and results of operations for the enterprise assets have been stated separately for all periods in our financial statements and in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the results of the enterprise division have been recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as loss from discontinued operations and the enterprise assets have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as current assets of discontinued operations  noncurrent assets of discontinued operations  and current liabilities of discontinued operations 
despite its characterization for accounting purposes as discontinued operations  the enterprise division will continue to be a part of our business until it is sold 

table of contents the operations of the enterprise division were previously included in our commercial applications segment 
the enterprise assets provide wireless data solutions  uniting messaging  synchronization and web technologies 
these solutions include package and vehicle tracking  productivity tools  and the ability to capture digital signatures for proof of delivery to a growing installed base of logistics customers 
the enterprise division is a leading reseller of blackberry devices and provide real time financial market data to wireless device users under annual subscriber contracts in the us and europe 
on march   pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated the same date  we issued and sold to two institutional lenders i million in aggregate principal amount of secured notes due march   which bears cash interest at the rate of per annum  or non cash interest at the rate of per annum  at our option  and ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million from this transaction  which are intended to be used for general corporate purposes 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that our management believes to be necessary to achieve a clear understanding of our financial statements and results of operations 
our management monitors and analyzes a number of key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
those indicators include revenue 
we derive revenue from products and services including recurring monthly service and subscriber fees  software licenses and related service fees for the design  development  and deployment of software and communication systems  and products and services derived from the delivery of information processing and communication systems to governmental agencies 
cost of revenue 
the major items comprising our cost of revenue are compensation and benefits  third party hardware and software  amortization of software development costs  and overhead expenses 
the costs of hardware and third party software are primarily associated with the delivery of systems  and fluctuate from period to period as a result of the relative volume  mix of projects  level of service support required and the complexity of customized products and services delivered 
amortization of software development costs  including acquired technology  is associated with the recognition of hosted and subscriber revenue and systems from our commercial applications segment 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are primarily compensation and benefits  professional fees  facility costs  marketing and sales related expenses  and travel costs as well as certain non cash expenses such as non cash stock compensation expense  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and amortization of acquired intangible assets 
liquidity and cash flows 
the primary driver of our cash flows is the results of our operations including discontinued operations 
important sources of our liquidity have been cash raised from our financings in connection with our acquisitions and our debt financing  all as described below under liquidity and capital resources  and borrowings under our bank credit agreement and lease financings secured for the purchase of equipment 
balance sheet 
we view cash  working capital  and accounts receivable balances and days revenues outstanding as important indicators of our financial health

nm not meaningful commercial applications hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenue and cost of revenue our hosted offerings mainly include our e  hosted position determining entity pde  voice over internet protocol voip e service and hosted location based service hlbs applications 
revenue from these offerings primarily consists of monthly recurring service fees and is recognized in the month earned 
e  pde  voip and hlbs service fees are priced based on units served during the period  such as the number of customer cell sites served  the number of connections to public service answering points psaps  or the number of customer subscribers served 
in we expedited deployments of psap s related to voip and e plus continued to increase the number of carriers and carrier billable units served 
in addition  we increased revenue from our voip e and hlbs recurring services primarily due to a new service contracts signed in these increases were partly offset by decreases in the average fee received per unit under pricing arrangements with some customers 
in  we continued to increase the number of carriers and carrier billable units served while experiencing a slight decline in average fee per unit under certain contracts  primarily due to volume thresholds as stipulated in customer contracts 

table of contents subscriber revenue is generated by the kivera assets we acquired in september  which provides wireless subscribers client software applications such as rand mcnally 
traffic 
the year over year increase in subscriber revenue was mainly the result of the inclusion of a full year s revenue in compared to a partial year in maintenance fees on our systems and software licenses are collected in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
unrecognized maintenance fees are included in deferred revenue 
custom software development  implementation and maintenance services may be provided under time and materials or fixed fee contracts 
overall  hosted  subscriber and maintenance revenue increased in the direct cost of our hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenue consists primarily of network access  data feed and circuit costs  compensation and benefits  equipment and software maintenance 
for the year ended december   the direct cost of hosted  subscriber and maintenance revenue increased for the following reasons 
in  we increased headcount and incurred costs related to custom development efforts responding to customer requests 
additionally  we increased costs for temporary contract staff to meet customer deployment requirements for voip 
while we increased the number of cell sites  subscribers and psaps served  our circuit and data access costs were relatively consistent year to year 
in  our facilities costs increased  related to renovations and enhancements to our principal network operations center 
for the year ended december   the cost of circuit and other data access costs accounted for approximately of total direct costs of hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenues 
the cost of circuit and other data access costs accounted for approximately of the total direct costs of our commercial hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenues for each of the years ended december  and the direct costs of maintenance revenue consists primarily of compensation and benefits 
the gross profit in hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenue remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenue from in to in commercial applications services revenue and cost of revenue services revenue does not represent a significant proportion of the revenue of our commercial applications segment 
however  commercial applications services revenue increased to million in from million in  because the unit generating it was owned for only a partial year in commercial systems revenue and cost of revenue we sell communications systems for enhanced services to wireless carriers 
these systems are designed to incorporate our licensed software 
we design our software to ensure that it is compliant with all applicable standards  notably including the gsm umts standards for location based wireless services that were established in and  as such  we believe our software is positioned for early adoption by carriers 
licensing fees for our carrier software are generally a function of its usage in our customer s network 
as a carrier s subscriber base or usage increases  the carrier must purchase additional capacity under its license agreement and we receive additional revenue 
systems revenues typically contain multiple elements  which may include the product license  installation  integration  and hardware 
the total arrangement fee is allocated among each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fair value is generally determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of evidence of fair value of a delivered element  revenue is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on fair value and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the software licenses are generally perpetual licenses for a specified number of users that allow for the purchase of annual maintenance at a specified rate 
we recognize license fee revenue when each of the following has occurred evidence of an arrangement is in place  we have delivered the software  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
software projects that require significant customization are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
we measure progress to completion using costs incurred compared to estimated total costs or labor hours incurred compared to estimated total labor 
table of contents hours for contracts that have a significant component of third party materials costs 
we recognize estimated losses under long term contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
software license fees billed and not recognized as revenue are included in deferred revenue 
systems revenue decreased for the year ended december   largely as a result of a decrease in licensing fees 
the decrease in licensing fees was primarily due to a large purchase of increased license capacity by a major carrier during the second quarter of  followed by a large but smaller license capacity purchase in the first quarter of in  revenue from commercial applications systems sales increased compared to primarily due to the large purchase of increased license capacity by a major carrier during the second quarter of the direct cost of our systems consists primarily of compensation  benefits  purchased equipment  third party software  travel expenses  and consulting fees as well as the amortization of both acquired and capitalized software development costs for all reported periods 
in  direct costs of systems consisted primarily of compensation  benefits  third party hardware and software  and million of amortization of software development costs 
in  such costs consisted primarily of compensation  benefits  third party hardware and software  and million of amortization of software development costs 
in  such costs primarily included compensation  benefits  travel and consulting fees plus million of amortization of software development costs  which included the accelerated amortization recorded during the year 
our commercial systems gross profit was million in versus million in and a loss of million in a larger proportion of high margin license sales in and the inclusion of a lower margin hardware sale in resulted in lower margins as a percentage of revenue for systems gross margins are higher in periods when systems revenue includes a higher proportion of software licenses relative to third party system components and integration labor 
system gross profits for was negatively affected by the significant cost of acceleration of amortization in the year 
we ascribe the lower revenue and related gross profit in primarily to later than expected implementation of location based service technology by wireless carriers

we recognize estimated losses on contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total labor hours or costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
under our contracts with the us government  contract costs  including the allocated indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
we record revenue under these contracts at estimated net realizable amounts 
for the year ended december   government segment revenue decreased as a result of lower systems revenue 
government hosted  subscriber  and maintenance revenue  cost of revenue  and gross profit in late  we began offering basic and extended maintenance contracts on our systems 
these maintenance fees are collected in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the direct costs of maintenance revenue consist primarily of compensation and benefits 
these contracts yielded approximately million of revenue and million of gross profit in government services revenue and cost of revenue government services revenue primarily consists of communications engineering  program management  help desk outsource  network design and management for government agencies 
our government segment also operates teleport facilities for data connectivity via satellite to and from north and south america  as well 
table of contents as africa and europe 
most such services are delivered under time and materials contracts 
for fixed price service contracts  we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method 
we recognize estimated losses on contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total labor hours or costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
services revenues increased to million in from million in and million in these increases throughout and were generated by new and expanded scope contracts resulting from increased sales emphasis on these types of projects and to a lesser extent  increased revenue generated from satellite airtime services for use of our teleport facilities and associated with our systems sales 
direct cost of government service revenue consists of compensation  benefits and travel incurred in delivering these services  and these costs increased as a result of the increased services volume in our gross profit from government services increased to million from million in and million in the increase in gross profit is due to higher revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased in due to a high margin contract which was primarily delivered in and completed in early gross profit as a percentage of revenue was lower in due to the mix of service contracts at various levels of profitability 
government systems revenue and cost of revenue we generate government systems revenue from the design  development  assembly and deployment of information processing and communication systems  primarily deployable communications systems  and integration of those systems into customer networks 
our principal government systems sales are of our swiftlink product line  which are lightweight  secure  deployable communications systems  to units of the us departments of state  justice  and defense and other agencies 
we recognize contract revenue as billable costs are incurred and for fixed price product delivery contracts using the percentage of completion method  measured by either total labor hours or total costs incurred compared to total estimated labor hours or costs 
labor hours are used as a measure of progress for projects that contain a significant amount of third party materials costs 
systems sales in our government segment decreased to million in from million in and million in the decrease in systems revenues is primarily due to decreased unit sales of our swiftlink and deployable communications systems throughout compared to and we believe that government procurement patterns for our systems have been affected by the shift from greater mission leader flexibility during the acute wartime environment of and to the more budget conscious environment in to date 
the cost of our government systems revenue consists of compensation  benefits  travel  satellite space segment and airtime  costs related to purchased equipment components  and the costs of third party contractors that we engage 
these equipment and third party costs are variable for our various types of products  and margins may fluctuate between periods based on the respective product mixes 
our government systems gross profit declined to million in from million in and million in the reduction is mainly as a result of lower systems sales volume

in millions research and development expense percent of revenue our research and development expense consists of compensation  benefits  travel costs  and a proportionate share of facilities and corporate overhead 
the costs of developing software products are 
table of contents expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility 
technological feasibility is established for our software products when a detailed program design is completed 
we incur research and development costs to enhance existing packaged software products as well as to create new software products including software hosted in our network operations center 
these costs primarily include compensation and benefits as well as costs associated with using third party laboratory and testing resources 
we expense such costs as they are incurred unless technological feasibility has been reached and we believe that the capitalized costs will be recoverable 
the expenses we incur relate to software applications which are being marketed to new and existing customers on a global basis 
throughout and  respectively  research and development was primarily focused on cellular and hosted location based applications  including voice over ip e  enhancements to our hosted location based applications  blending of technology of our existing products while incorporating aspects from our acquisitions  and other feature enhancements 
in  we primarily focused on expanded functionality of our location platform software 
management continually assesses our spending on research and development to ensure resources are focused on products that are expected to achieve the highest level of success 
further  in we capitalized million of software development costs for certain software projects in accordance with the above policy 
the capitalized costs relate to our location based software and our voice over ip e service 
these costs will be amortized on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the product s estimated useful life  which is never greater than three years 
amortization is also computed using the ratio that current revenue for the product bears to the total of current and anticipated future revenue for that product the revenue curve method 
if this revenue curve method results in amortization greater than the amount computed using the straight line method  amortization is recorded at that greater amount 
we believe that these capitalized costs will be recoverable from future gross profits generated by these products 
prior to the second quarter of  our estimates did not sufficiently demonstrate future realizability of our software development costs expended on such products  and accordingly  all such costs were expensed as incurred 
research and development expense decreased in as compared with this decrease is partially due to the capitalization of approximately million and partially due to developers working on custom development efforts as well as a slight reduction in headcount associated with our development efforts 
the increase in research and development spending in as compared to is primarily a function of the costs incurred related to development efforts by the engineers added via the kivera acquisition 
our research and development expenditures have also yielded over patents  primarily for wireless messaging and location technology  and over pending patent applications 
we believe that the intellectual property represented by these patents is a valuable asset that will contribute to our operations in and beyond 
sales and marketing expense vs 
vs 
in millions sales and marketing expense percent of revenue our sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits  trade show expenses  travel costs  advertising and public relations costs as well as a proportionate share of facility related costs which are expensed as incurred 
our marketing efforts also include speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences 
we sell our software products and services through our direct sales force and through indirect channels 
we have also historically leveraged our relationship with original equipment manufacturers to market our software products to wireless carrier customers 
we sell our products and services to agencies and departments of the us government primarily through direct sales professionals 
sales and marketing costs increased in primarily as a result of adding additional government segment sales personnel at the end of  and increased public relations fees in in  such costs were similar to the level of spending in such costs may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on spending on tradeshows and variable compensation based on level of revenue 

table of contents general and administrative expense vs

these costs include compensation  benefits  professional fees  travel  and a proportionate share of rent  utilities and other facilities costs which are expensed as incurred 
the increase in was primarily attributable to increased professional fees associated with patent monetization and public company regulatory compliance costs 
the increase in over the level in was primarily attributable to the initial costs of complying with the sarbanes oxley act plus increased legal fees 
non cash stock compensation expense vs

in the second quarters of and  we issued restricted stock to directors and certain key executives 
the restrictions expired at the end of one year for directors and expire in annual increments over three years for executives and are based on continued employment 
the fair value of the restricted stock at issuance has been recorded as deferred compensation and is being amortized to non cash stock compensation expense using the straight line method over the period during which the restrictions expire 
non cash stock compensation expense is comprised of expenses related to incentive stock options granted to employees and directors prior to our initial public offering and expense related to restricted stock granted to directors and certain key executives in and net loss  as reported  includes million  million  and million of non cash stock compensation expense related to restricted stock grants and million  million  and million of non cash stock compensation expense related to the options granted prior to our initial public offering for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to record future stock compensation expense of million as a result of these restricted stock grants that will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for executives 
non cash stock compensation expense constitutes portions of our direct cost of revenue  research and development expense  sales and marketing expense  and general and administrative expense as detailed in the table presented with our consolidated statement of operations presented in item as a result of a recent change in the relevant accounting standards  effective january   we will begin to recognize expense for all stock options granted to employees  including those issued at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our class a common stock on the date of grant  based on the fair value of the award 
we do not currently recognize expense for such options in our consolidated statement of operations 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements presented in item in this annual report on form k  had we adopted the revised standard prior to december   the impact would have been as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note to those consolidated financial statements 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  our board of directors adopted resolutions to accelerate the vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options 
the accelerated vesting provisions apply to all options with an exercise price of or greater 
as a result  options to purchase  shares of our stock became fully exercisable as of october  
table of contents the primary purpose of the accelerated vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense the company would otherwise recognize in its statement of operations with respect to these options upon the adoption of statement no 
r  which we are required to adopt on january  financial accounting standards board statement no 
r share based payment will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations rather than as a pro forma footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 
the acceleration of the vesting of these options will eliminate the future non cash stock compensation expense associated with these outstanding options 
we estimate that the related future compensation expense to be recorded under statement no 
r that is eliminated as a result of the acceleration of vesting these options is approximately million

the estimated useful life of an asset generally ranges from years for furniture  fixtures  and leasehold improvements to years for most other types of assets including computers  software  telephony equipment and vehicles 
expense generally increases year over year as a result of the level of capital expenditures made during the year to support our operations and development efforts

the amended line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of the company  and bears interest at prime plus per annum  with a minimum prime rate of per annum and a borrowing rate of per annum at december  our amended line of credit contains covenants requiring us to maintain at least million of tangible net worth  as defined  and at least million in cash each measured monthly as well as restrictive covenants including  among others  restrictions on our ability to merge  acquire assets above prescribed thresholds  undertake actions outside the ordinary course of our business including the incurrence of indebtedness  guarantee debt  distribute dividends  and repurchase our 
table of contents stock 
on march   the tangible net worth covenant  as defined  was amended such that the company will only be required to maintain at least million of tangible net worth  as defined  through march   at which time the amount of required tangible net worth  as defined  reverts back to the million 
the minimum tangible net worth amount per the line of credit agreement is adjusted upward for income  subordinated debt and equity raised and proceeds of any sale of enterprise assets 
in we borrowed million under the terms of an equipment loan secured by purchased equipment for a term of three years 
as of december   approximately million was outstanding under the equipment loan which will be paid monthly through december there was million outstanding under our line of credit 
we had approximately million of unused availability under our line of credit and our tangible net worth  as defined  was million as of december  we are in compliance with our covenants as of december  we currently believe that we have sufficient capital resources with cash generated from operations as well as cash on hand to meet our anticipated cash operating expenses  working capital  and capital expenditure and debt service needs for the next twelve months 
we expect additional cash in from sales of our enterprise division and surplus patents 
we have borrowing capacity available to us in the form of capital leases as well as a line of credit arrangement with our bank which expires in september we may also consider raising capital in the public markets as a means to meet our capital needs and to invest in our business 
although we may need to return to the capital markets  establish new credit facilities or raise capital in private transactions in order to meet our capital requirements  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to access these potential sources of funds on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we have incurred net losses in recent years  and our monthly cash flows are subject to variability 
in order to improve our results of operations and cash flows  we are focusing our efforts on revenue growth  primarily in the hosted and subscriber service lines  which provide for more predictable revenue streams 
we have also committed to a plan to sell the enterprise assets 
in the event that our results of operations in are not adequate to fund ongoing obligations  and or we are not able to sell the enterprise assets  we would defer or avoid cash expenditures in other areas  including research and development  capital expenditures and or administrative costs 
we believe that our existing cash resources  including proceeds received from financings which occurred in march  and availability under the bank line of credit  coupled with expected cash from operations  will provide sufficient liquidity for us to continue to meet our obligations for the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our obligations and  as discussed below  the provisions of our lending documents create the possibility that our financing arrangements may not remain available to us 
our bank credit agreement contains a tangible net worth covenant which is required to be met on a monthly basis 
in march  the bank amended our line of credit agreement  reducing the tangible net worth requirement through march  the line of credit agreement also contains a subjective acceleration clause which allows the bank to declare the amounts outstanding under the line of credit due and payable if certain material adverse changes occur 
also  the loan document governing the subordinated debt issued in march contains a cross default provision that would allow the debt holder to accelerate payment of the subordinated debt if other debt exceeding million is declared due and payable 
we believe that we will continue to comply with our restrictive covenants under our debt agreements 
if our performance does not result in compliance with any of the restrictive covenants  or if our line of credit agreement lender seeks to exercise its rights under the subjective acceleration clause referred to above  we would seek to further modify our financing arrangements  but there can be no assurance that our debt holders would not exercise their rights and remedies under their agreements with us  including declaring all outstanding debt due and payable 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the restrictive covenants under our debt agreements and note to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the secured notes entered into in march operating cash flows improved in primarily as a result of increased cash provided by lower working capital needs and improved earnings 
a significant favorable change in unbilled receivables and  to a lesser extent  accounts payable and accrued expenses  accrued payroll and deferred revenue were partially offset by 
table of contents the unfavorable changes in accounts receivable  inventory and other current assets 
management increased its focus on its billing and collection efforts in which reduced total days outstanding to from days in additionally  there were fewer long term projects that remained open in compared to and  and therefore unbilled receivables were lower in net cash used in investing activities was lower in than because there were no acquisitions  like our enterprise and kivera acquisitions described below 
the acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the cash used for investing activities during the amount of capital expenditures in were million and capitalized software development costs were million 
capital expenditure in were slightly higher at million and included an increase in capital expenditures to support our service bureau office move and to expand our business 
there were no capitalized software development costs in due to the stage of development efforts incurred in and management s judgments as to the realizability of these costs at that time 
net cash used in investing activities was lower in compared to primarily because of the acquisitions 
net cash of million was used for financing activities in compared to million provided by financing activities in and million provided by financing activities in in  we made payments under long term debt and capital lease obligations while increasing borrowing under our line of credit to a lesser extent 
the change in compared to is primarily due to the january and august financings see below which did not recur in these offerings provided net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to fund our acquisitions and for payments under our existing long term debt and capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities in included proceeds from increases in long term debt obligations used to fund capital expenditures as an alternative to capital lease obligations 
on september   we acquired substantially all of the assets of kivera  inc  for approximately million in cash 
to fund the kivera acquisition  on august  we entered a securities purchase agreement with the same third party investors who purchased our securities used to finance the enterprise acquisition 
pursuant to this agreement  we raised million in cash through the sale of  shares of our class a common stock 
combined proceeds from both the january and august financings  after financing fees  were approximately million 
as of the same date  we entered into a waiver agreement with the holder of the debenture 
the waiver modified certain provisions of the debenture as follows the holder of the debenture was required to convert the entire million principal amount into shares of our class a common stock by the end of  all of the material restrictive covenants contained in the debenture were nullified and the conversion price set forth in the debenture was decreased from to as an inducement to enter into the waiver an adjustment such that conversion of the debenture will yield an additional  shares of class a common stock 
as additional consideration  we paid the holder of the debenture a million one time fee in cash 
as a result  the entire face amount of the debenture had been converted into shares of our class a common stock as of december  on march   pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated the same date  we issued and sold to two institutional lenders i million in aggregate principal amount of secured notes due march   which bear cash interest at the rate of per annum  or non cash interest  in the form of additional notes  at the rate of per annum  at our option  and ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our class a common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million from this transaction  which are intended to be used for general corporate purposes
