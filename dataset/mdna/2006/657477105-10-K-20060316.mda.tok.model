critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
the most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
the company has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan loss on a quarterly basis 
we believe that the allowance for loan loss is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans  including current and projected economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans and commitments 
we determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  using an analysis of the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits on an individual basis 
we segment the loan portfolios into as many components as practical  with each component having similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
management has an established methodology for calculating the level of the allowance for loan losses 
we analyze the following components of the portfolio and consider them in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses specific allowances defined as o management assessment of all loans classified as substandard or worse  with an outstanding balance of  or more o a specific allowance is provided for any amount by which the loan s collateral fair value is insufficient to cover the loan  or discounting estimated future cash flows  or by observing the loan s market price if it is of a kind for which there is a secondary market general allowance defined as o an allowance for all loans outstanding within the portfolio and not contained in the specific allowance judgmental allowance defined as o national and local economic trends and conditions o trends in volume of loans o changes in underwriting standards and or lending personnel o concentrations of credit within the portfolio no assurance can be given that the company will not sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio will not require an increase in the allowance 
prevailing factors in association with the methodology may include improvement or deterioration of individual commitments or pools of similar loans  or loan concentrations 
available for sale securities 
sfas requires that available for sale securities be carried at fair value 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate in that the fair value of a security is based on quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
adjustments to the available for sale securities fair value impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and shareholders equity 
deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced

provision and allowance for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
this is maintained through periodic charges to earnings 
these charges are shown in the consolidated statements of operations as provision for loan losses 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
however  for a variety of reasons  not all losses are immediately known to the company and  of those that are known  the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time 
the balance of the company s allowance for loan losses is meant to be an estimate of the probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company s written lending policies  along with applicable laws and regulations governing the extension of credit  require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management through loan product diversification  lending limits  ongoing credit reviews  both internal and external  along with approval policies prior to funding of any loan 
the company manages and controls credit risk through diversification  close monitoring of any portfolio concentrations  loan limits to individuals and reviewing historical losses incurred by the company 
loans that are performing but have shown some signs of weakness are subjected to more stringent reporting and oversight 
management has established a monitoring system for any concentration within the portfolio 
the existing portfolio consists of commercial loans to businesses  commercial and residential real estate loans and consumer products 
the portfolio contains variable rate loans as well as loans with rates fixed for up to ten years 
fixed rate loans are primarily associated with real estate lending 
assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the allocation process the company formally assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
determination of the adequacy is based on ongoing assessments of the probable risk in the outstanding loan portfolio 
these assessments include periodic re grading of credits based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  growth of the portfolio as a whole or by segment and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are re graded as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower  when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of nonpayment or if they become delinquent on a frequent basis 
re grading of classified loans will occur at least monthly 
confirmation of the quality of the grading process is obtained by independent credit reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by regulatory examiners 
the company evaluates individual loans that meet its criteria loans over  and graded substandard or lower to determine if impaired and to establish a specific allowance as necessary 
the company establishes percentages for the general allowance requirements for other loans according to their classification as determined by the company s internal grading system 
these loans are identified through the following categories pass these loans consist of the those graded as excellent  good and satisfactory 
watch these loans are not classified  but they contain potentially unsatisfactory characteristics 
special mention these assets constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk  but not to the point of justifying a classification to substandard 
substandard these are loans inadequately protected by current sound worth  paying capacity of the borrower or pledged collateral 
substandard loans normally have one or more well defined weaknesses that could jeopardize the repayment of the debt 
doubtful the possibility of loss is extremely high  but because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset  writing down the loan and recognizing the loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined 
loss loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted 
the above  along with specific allocations for concentrations in real estate  sba a program and leases  are taken into consideration when evaluating the company s allowance for loan losses 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses was  representing of loans outstanding  as compared with an allowance for loan losses balance of  at december   representing of loans outstanding 
during  and    and  respectively  was charged to expense for the provision for loan losses 
non performing loans the company s policy is to place loans on nonaccrual status when  for any reason  principal or interest is past due for ninety days or more unless they are both well secured and in the process of collection 
any interest accrued  but unpaid  is reversed against current income 
thereafter  interest is recognized as income only as it is collected in cash 
as of december  and  there were no nonaccrual loans  loans that were past due ninety days or more  or troubled debt restructurings

net loans charged off were  in compared with net charge offs of  in management recognizes that the estimation of probable losses in the portfolio is not a science and therefore the current allowance for loan losses is not expected to be equal to the result of the assessment 
it is expected  however  that the assessment will demonstrate that the actual reserve is adequate for coverage of probable loan losses in the existing portfolio 
to the extent that the current allowance is deemed insufficient to cover the estimate of unidentified losses  management will record an additional provision for loan loss 
if the allowance is greater than appears to be required at that point in time  the provision expense may be adjusted accordingly 
based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the  allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
in the course of examination  regulators may require the company to increase its amount in its allowance for loan losses based on information available to them at the time of their evaluation 
noninterest income details of noninterest income are as follows in s service charges and other fees    gain on sale of investment securities  net other income    total    noninterest income for year decreased  or  compared with the decline reflects a decrease in service charge income resulting from reduced non sufficient funds nsf check activity 
in addition  no securities gains were recorded in compared with the securities gains of  in increases during compared with were  or

noninterest expense details of noninterest expense are as follows in s salaries and related benefits    occupancy    equipment    other    total    salaries and benefits expense increased and in and  respectively  from the previous year 
the increases were primarily due to increases in the number of full time equivalent employees  which has increased from approximately at year end to at year end as the company has continued to grow its operations 
the increase in occupancy expense during compared with was primarily due to having vacant space in the vacaville office building owned by the company and to opening a branch office in american canyon in august the increase in occupancy expense in compared with was primarily in rent and depreciation associated with opening a new branch in american canyon 
equipment expense increased in compared with the increase in compared to was primarily due to the company reversing approximately  in accrued maintenance fees during as the result of settling litigation with a former software supplier and additional costs associated with maintaining atms 
the key components of other expenses are as follows in s professional services    business promotion stationery supplies insurance other    total    professional services increased  or  in compared with the prior year primarily due to increases in consulting and audit costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance work 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower legal fees  offset by increased audit expense 
business promotion expense decreased in compared with this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advertising costs 
the increase in compared with was primarily the result of increased marketing expenditures 
stationery and supplies expense increased and in and respectively  reflecting overall volume increases and increased costs associated with the opening of a branch office in american canyon in august insurance expenses decreased in compared to a increase in the decrease in was due to a decrease in workers compensation insurance costs 
the increase in was due to increases in volumes and number of locations  as well as increases in workers compensation costs 
other expenses decreased in compared to an increase of in the decrease in was primarily due to decreases in postage and dues and subscription expenses

liquidity and capital adequacy the company s liquidity is determined by the level of assets such as cash  federal funds sold and unpledged marketable securities together with other funding sources that are readily convertible to cash and cash equivalents and other funding sources to meet customer withdrawal and borrowing needs 
the company s liquidity position is reviewed by management on a regular basis to verify that it is adequate to meet projected loan funding and potential withdrawal of deposits 
in addition to investment secutities classified as available for sale  the company also has available funding from other sources such as the federal home loan bank and federal fund lines of credit 
as of december   the company had approximately million available from these sources for borrowing 
the company relies on these funding sources to assist in funding loans when loan demand outpaces deposit growth 
at year end  liquid assets defined as cash  federal funds sold  deposits in other financial institutions and securities categorized as available for sale represented of total assets  as compared with as of year end the level of liquid assets at december  exceeds the liquidity required by the company s liquidity policy 
management expects to be able to meet the liquidity needs of the company during primarily through balancing loan growth with corresponding increases in deposits

accordingly  the stock dividend will not materially impact the company s overall capital 
the cash dividend will total approximately  equating to a reduction in the company s leverage ratio of approximately 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclousure about market risk the company s exposure to market risk exists primarily in interest rate risk in the balance sheet 
the objective of market risk management is to mitigate an undue adverse impact on earnings and capital arising from changes in interest rates and other market variables 
this risk management objective supports the company s broad objective of enhancing shareholder value  which encompasses stable earnings growth over time 
the board of directors  through its asset liability management committee alco  approves the alm policy  which governs the management of market risk and liquidity 
alco is responsible for ongoing management of interest rate risk as well as liquidity risk  including formulation of risk management strategies 
the chief financial officer is primarily responsible for the implementation of risk management strategies approved by alco and for operating management of market risk through the funding and investment activities of the company 
the company manages the market risk associated with our asset and liability management activities as described below 
interest rate risk management alco monitors interest rate risk quarterly through a variety of modeling techniques that are used to quantify the sensitivity of net interest income nii and economic value of equity eve to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risk  alco monitors nii sensitivity over a twelve month time horizon and in response to a variety of interest rate changes 
the company s nii policy measure involves a simulation of nii in which the company estimates the impact that proportional shifts in the yield curve would have on earnings over a twelve month horizon  given the projected balance sheet profile 
simulation of nii is the primary tool used to measure the company s interest rate risk 
the nii simulations use a twelve month projected balance sheet in order to model the impact of interest rate changes 
assumptions are made to model the future behavior of deposit rates and loan spreads based on management s outlook and historical experience 
at december   the nii simulation showed modest asset sensitivity to proportional rate shifts 
a basis point proportional shift would raise twelve month nii by percent  while a similar downward shift would reduce it by percent 
continued enhancements to the company s interest rate risk modeling may make prior year comparisons of nii less meaningful 
nii simulation estimated change in nii change in interest rates basis points as a of flat nii flat in addition to nii  the company measures the sensitivity of eve to interest rate shocks 
eve is reviewed and monitored for its compliance with alco limits 
consistent with the projected asset sensitivity of earnings over time  the company s eve shows asset sensitivity as well 
management believes that  together  our nii and eve simulations provide management with a reasonably comprehensive view of the sensitivity of our operating results and value profile to changes in interest rates  at least over the measurement horizon 
however  as with any financial model  the underlying assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as modeling techniques and theory improve and historical data becomes more readily accessible 
consequently  the simulation models cannot predict with certainty how rising or falling interest rates might impact net interest income 
actual and simulated results will differ to the extent there are differences between actual and assumed interest rate changes  balance sheet volumes  and management strategies  among other factors 
in general  the core balance sheet is relatively asset sensitive  meaning that investments and loans generally re price more quickly than core deposits 
in managing the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet  the company uses the investment securities portfolio as the primary tool to adjust the risk profile 
at december  and december   the securities available for sale portfolio totaled million and million  respectively 
the estimated effective duration of the available for sale portfolio was at december   compared to at december  effective duration is a measure of price sensitivity of a bond portfolio to immediate parallel shifts in interest rates 
an effective duration of suggests an expected price decline of approximately percent for an immediate one percent increase in interest rates 
gap analysis interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
one aspect of these repricing characteristics is the time frame within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames of interest bearing assets and liabilities is sometimes called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing in each of a number of periods 
another aspect of these repricing characteristics is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market interest rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing given various changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gaps are measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in our current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the following interest rate sensitivity table shows our repricing gaps as of december  in this table transaction deposits  which may be repriced at will by us  have been included in the less than month category 
the inclusion of all of the transaction deposits in the less than month repricing category causes us to appear liability sensitive 
because we may reprice our transaction deposits at will  transaction deposits may or may not reprice immediately with changes in interest rates 
in recent years of moderate interest rate changes  our earnings have reacted as though the gap position is slightly asset sensitive mainly because the magnitude of interest bearing liability repricing has been less than the magnitude of interest earning asset repricing 
this difference in the magnitude of asset and liability repricing is mainly due to our strong core deposit base  which although they may be repriced within three months  historically  the timing of their repricing has been longer than three months and the magnitude of their repricing has been minimal 
due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  we do not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
instead  we rely on the more sophisticated interest rate risk simulation model described above as our primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth the repricing opportunities for rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities at december  rate sensitivity analysis usually excludes noninterest bearing demand deposits  which totaled  rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first
