critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
note to the consolidated financial statements more fully describes our significant accounting policies  however  following are those accounting policies that management considers most critical to the company s financial statements 
grain inventories the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the grain inventories are freely traded  have quoted market prices  and may be sold without significant additional processing 
management estimates market value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets 
changes in market value are recorded as merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
if management used different methods or factors to estimate market value  amounts reported as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
additionally  if market conditions change subsequent to year end  amounts reported in future periods as inventories and merchandising revenues could differ 
because the company marks to market inventories and sales commitments  gross profit on a grain sale transaction is recognized when a contract for sale of the grain is executed 
the related revenue is recognized upon shipment of the grain  at which time title transfers and customer acceptance occurs 
grain inventories contain valuation reserves established to recognize the difference in quality and value between contractual grades and the actual quality grades of inventory held by the company 
these quality reserves also require management to exercise judgment 
marketing agreement the company has negotiated a marketing agreement that covers certain of its grain facilities certain of which are leased from cargill 
under this five year amended and restated agreement ending in may  the company sells grain from these facilities to cargill at market prices 
income earned from operating the facilities including buying  storing and selling grain and providing grain marketing services to its producer customers over a specified threshold is shared with cargill 
measurement of this threshold is made on a cumulative basis and cash is paid to cargill if required at each contract year end 
the company recognizes its share of income to date at each month end and accrues for any payment to cargill in accordance with emerging issues task force topic d  accounting for management fees based on a formula 
the adoption of this standard  effective for periods beginning after january  
table of contents  resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment increase of million after tax in derivatives commodity contracts the company utilizes regulated commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its market price exposure on the grain it owns and related forward purchase and sale contracts 
these contracts are included in the balance sheet in inventory at their current market value 
realized and unrealized gains and losses in the market value of these futures and option contracts are included in the income statement as a component of sales and merchandising revenues 
while the company considers all of its commodity contracts to be effective economic hedges  the company does not designate its commodity futures and options contracts as hedges 
therefore  the company does not defer gains and losses on these same contracts as would occur for designated hedges under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
both the underlying inventory and forward purchase and sale contracts and the related futures and options contracts are marked to market on a daily basis 
impairment of long lived assets the company s various business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or rolling stock 
in addition  the company has a limited amount of intangible assets and goodwill described more fully in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item that it acquired in various business combinations 
whenever changing conditions warrant  we review the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets that may be impacted 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
while we believe the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that the expected future cash flows will be realized 
if management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these cash flows  the company could recognize different amounts of expense in future periods 
employee benefit plans the company provides substantially all full time employees with pension benefits and full time employees hired before january  with postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities  rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
the company uses third party specialists to assist management in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans 
if management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly and then the company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods 
subsequent december   the company amended its defined benefit pension plans effective january  the provisions of this amendment 
table of contents include freezing benefits for the retail line of business employees as of december   modifying the calculation of benefits for the non retail line of business employees as of december  with future benefits to be calculated using a new career average formula and in the case of all employees  compensation for the years will be includable in the final average pay formula calculating the final benefit earned for years prior to december  certain accounting guidance  including the guidance applicable to pensions and postretirement benefits does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  the net amount is disclosed as an unrecognized gain or loss in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item at december   we had an unrecognized loss related to our pension plans of million compared to an unrecognized loss of million at december  for the postretirement benefit plans  our december  unrecognized loss was million as compared to an unrecognized loss of million at december  a portion of the december  unrecognized loss for both pension and postretirement benefits will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years after will depend in large part on the actual experience of the plans in and beyond 
in  benefits expense included million and million of amortization of the unrecognized loss existing at december  for the pension and postretirement plans  respectively 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue for the sales of its products at the time of shipment 
gross profit on sales of grain is recognized when sales contracts are entered into as the company marks its contracts to the market on a daily basis 
revenues from other merchandising activities are recognized as open grain contracts are marked to market or as related services are provided 
rental revenues on operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease

shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
the company sells railcars to financial intermediaries and other customers

the leases from financial intermediaries are generally structured as sale 
table of contents leaseback transactions 
lease income and lease expense are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease for most leases 
as part of the railcar acquisition of railroad rolling stock and leasing assets from progress energy and subsidiaries described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item  the company acquired some existing leases where the monthly lease fee is contingent upon some measure of usage per diem leases 
this monthly usage is tracked  billed and collected by third party service providers and funds are generally remitted to the company along with usage data three months after they are earned 
the company records lease revenue for these per diem arrangements based on recent historical usage patterns and records a true up adjustment when the actual data is received 
revenues recognized under per diem arrangements totaled million in and million in the company periodically finances some of its railcars through leases with a financial intermediary  the terms of which require the company to capitalize the assets and record the net present value of the lease obligation on its balance sheet as a long term borrowing 
there are no gains or losses on these financing transactions 
the obligation is included with the company s long term debt as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
railcars under these leases are being depreciated to their residual value over the term of the lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to financial intermediaries and assigns the related operating lease on a non recourse basis 
the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediaries  and receives a fee for such services when earned 
on the date of sale  the company recognizes the proceeds from sales of railcars in non recourse lease transactions as revenue 
management and service fees are recognized as revenue as the underlying services are provided  which is generally spread evenly over the lease term 
taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item

additional segment information is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item sales and merchandising revenues agriculture rail turf specialty retail total gross profit agriculture rail turf specialty retail total 
table of contents operating income loss agriculture rail turf specialty retail other total comparison of with sales and merchandising revenues for totaled billion  an increase of million  or  from sales in the agriculture group were down million  or less than 
grain sales decreased million resulting from a decrease in the average price of bushels sold partially offset by a volume increase 
the largest decrease in average price per bushel sold was a decrease in corn of 
fertilizer sales were up million  or  due to an increase in the average price per ton sold partially offset by a decrease in volume 
much of the price increase relates to escalation in prices of the basic raw materials  primarily phosphates  potassium and nitrogen 
generally  these increases can be passed through to customers although a price increase may also reduce consumer demand at the producer level 
revenues in both grain and fertilizer businesses are significantly impacted by the market price of the commodities being sold 
merchandising revenues in the agriculture group were up million  or  due primarily to increased space income before interest charges in the grain division 
space income is income earned on grain held for our account or for our customers and includes storage fees earned and appreciation or depreciation in the value of grain owned 
grain on hand at december  was million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
the harvest results were weaker than in the company s market area for all three primary grains handled corn  soybeans and wheat 
although weaker  the harvest was better than originally anticipated 
corn production in ohio  indiana  illinois and michigan decreased from production by  soybean production decreased by and wheat production decreased by 
illinois crops were the hardest hit in the region by dry weather and consequently experienced the largest reduction 
in september  the company invested approximately million for a interest in the andersons albion ethanol llc which began construction of a million gallon per year ethanol production facility adjacent to the company s albion  michigan grain facility

in february  the company invested million for a interest in the andersons clymers ethanol llc  which is constructing a million gallon per year ethanol production facility located adjacent to the company s clymers  indiana grain facility 
upon completion  the company will operate the ethanol facility under a management agreement and provide origination  marketing and risk management services also under contracts with the llc 
the company is continuing its investigation into other possible opportunities in the ethanol industry and may increase its involvement through additional investments in stand alone facilities  investments in holding companies or contracts to provide services to new or existing facilities 
if the projected growth of the ethanol industry occurs  it could impact the company s grain business in potentially significant ways 
it is expected to increase demand for corn  with resulting higher prices and increased competition 
in certain situations  our grain business could be negatively impacted if there are new ethanol plants constructed in our region and near our existing facilities that would compete for locally available corn 
conversely  providing grain origination services and distillers dried grain marketing services to the ethanol industry is a potential growth opportunity for our grain trading operations 
we believe that the increase in demand for corn to serve the growing ethanol industry may force a reduction in the plantings of other crops  which would positively impact the plant nutrient division by increasing demand for nitrogen  phosphates and potassium 
the growth of corn is more dependent on these fertilizer products than soybeans or wheat

the marketability of the company s grain inventories and the availability of short term lines of credit enhance the company s liquidity 
in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity is adequate to meet short term and long term needs

table of contents off balance sheet transactions the company s rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease 
the following table describes the railcar and locomotive positions at december  method of control financial statement number owned railcars available for sale on balance sheet current owned railcar assets leased to others on balance sheet non current  railcars leased from financial intermediaries off balance sheet  railcars non recourse arrangements off balance sheet  total railcars locomotive assets leased to others on balance sheet non current locomotives leased from financial intermediaries under limited recourse arrangements off balance sheet locomotives non recourse arrangements off balance sheet total locomotives in addition  the company manages approximately railcars for third party customers or owners for which it receives a fee 
the company has future lease payment commitments aggregating million for the railcars leased by the company from financial intermediaries under various operating leases 
remaining lease terms vary with none exceeding eight years 
the majority of these railcars have been leased to customers at december  over similar terms 
this segment manages risk by match funding which means matching terms between the lease to the customer and the funding arrangement with the financial intermediary  where possible  and ongoing evaluation of lessee credit worthiness 
in addition  the company prefers non recourse lease transactions  whenever possible  in order to minimize its credit risk 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  the company follows a policy of hedging its inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the instruments used are exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options hedges  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december in thousands net long position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values
