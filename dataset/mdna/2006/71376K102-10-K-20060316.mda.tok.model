item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond the company s control 
these include  among other factors  general business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  the attainment of design wins and obtaining orders as a result  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential impairments related to investments and foreign regulations 
in addition  during weak economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview the following contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the securities act of and securities exchange act of and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company is a leading developer of communications platforms and systems for the embedded communications marketplace 
it targets three vertical markets telecommunications  defense and homeland security  and commercial 
of the three vertical markets served  telecommunications is the largest 
a breakdown of the telecommunications applications that utilize the company s products is as follows voice over ip voip represents approximately  wireless infrastructure represents  and the remaining is spread across ip multimedia systems and other applications 
the company markets its products through its direct worldwide sales force under a variety of brand names including ipnexus  segway nexusware and advanced managed platforms 
the company s products are based on open standards and are sold as fully integrated  purpose built  application ready platforms  or as individual blade components for the embedded communications marketplace 
when sold as platforms  known as the company s advanced managed platform products  customers can quickly move to the enhanced value steps of their products while realizing distinct cost advantages  increased overall system reliability and performance  and improved time to market 
since its introduction in  the advanced managed platform product line has realized more than new design wins 
if successfully implemented by our customers  each is expected to generate greater than million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
in addition  the company realized more than new design wins for components solutions in the same time period 
not all design wins are expected to result in production orders 
throughout  the company continued to develop  sell and further commercialize various platform configurations allowing customers to select the appropriate platform  blade components and software to fit system and application requirements with full confidence that all elements have been designed to work together 
in july  the board of directors authorized the company to repurchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
to date  there have been no repurchases of shares under this program 
during the third quarter  the company completed its plan to centralize its multi location operations and to streamline the organization 
management announced this plan in october the annualized savings generated by centralizing sales  marketing and accounting functions into corporate operations is expected to be approximately million  and the annualized savings generated by centralizing manufacturing functions into the rochester manufacturing operation is expected to be approximately 
million 
management expects a portion of the savings realized under this plan will be reinvested to stimulate future growth 
on november   michael skarzynski joined the company as president and chief executive officer  succeeding donald turrell 
since joining  mr 
skarzynski has spent time meeting with employees  customers  partners and investors around the world to develop a broad understanding of the company s value proposition 
in the process  mr 
skarzynski assessed the company s strengths and capabilities  and developed strategic objectives focused on market leadership and profitable growth 
the goal of this strategy is to drive sustained and profitable revenue growth 
the company expects to achieve this objective through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions 
to move forward into and to establish a foundation upon which the company can reach its aggressive growth goals  a company wide transformation is underway 
the transformation will move the company from its traditional engineering and technology focus  to a new emphasis on sales and marketing 
management s energies and the company s resources will be refocused on these objectives 
management is also sharpening its focus on its platform strategy to capitalize on additional market opportunities 
while in an early stage of this transformation  the company has made several leadership changes that are expected to strengthen the company and enable it to meet these growth objectives 
during the first half of  management expects to hire additional sales people to accelerate the company s revenue growth 
at the same time  management is committed to taking actions that are necessary to achieve profitable growth 
these actions could include workforce reductions  facilities closures  outsourcings or other actions 
on january   the company announced its plan to close its engineering center in norwood  massachusetts and transfer product development and customer support for the voice technology products to other company engineering centers 
during the first half of  management is also relocating its san luis obispo engineering group to more cost effective office space in the san luis obispo area and its ottawa operations to a suburban location in the ottawa area 
management expects that the preponderance of these actions will be completed during the first half of critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures by the company  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company generally cannot make estimates until preliminary results for a financial quarter are known and analyzed 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below o revenue recognition o software development costs o valuation of inventories o income taxes o product warranty o carrying value of goodwill revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of the company s revenue and include hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
the company recognizes revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  the company sells its products on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment by the company 
if these conditions are not met  the company will defer revenue recognition until such time these conditions have been satisfied 
revenue earned from arrangements for software is accounted for under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition and eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from software requiring significant production  modification  or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  the company defers revenue recognition and will recognize revenue when the company has fulfilled its obligations under the arrangement 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
the company also sells certain products through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because the company s terms of sale can vary  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if in the judgment of management  technological feasibility for a particular project has not been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to software development costs is a critical accounting estimate because the company s management exercises judgment in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the company s inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
the company records provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are the company s purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials see liquidity and capital resources for further information on foreign regulations 
the company manages its exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of such assets and liabilities 
the company would record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if the company should determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
product warranty the company has warranty obligations in connection with the sale of certain of its products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
the company estimates its future warranty costs based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to product warranty is a critical accounting estimate because the company exercises judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
carrying value of goodwill the company conducts tests for impairments of goodwill annually  at year end  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because these impairment tests include management estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the goodwill s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
strategy the company has a history of successfully adapting its products and services to a constantly changing technology driven marketplace 
this adaptation has been demonstrated through the course of several business cycles that have occurred since its founding in beginning in  a new product strategy was adopted 
this strategy repositioned the company to deliver fully managed  system level platform solutions to the embedded communications marketplace 
throughout  the company continued to focus its operating efforts on this strategy 
this line of platform solutions specifically addresses equipment manufacturers requirements for an increased level of system integration and services from suppliers  thus allowing them to focus on their value added stages of product development  which in most cases is application software 
the company s strategy also enables customers to replace proprietary or legacy platforms with the latest generation of fully managed system functionality 
through its acquisitions and internal investments over the past several years  management believes this strategy has moved the company from a position of addressing approximately of the available market served in  to a position of addressing over of the available market served by the end of the company s goal is to drive sustained and profitable revenue 
the company expects to achieve these objectives through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions 
to move forward into and establish a foundation upon which the company can reach its aggressive growth goals  a company wide transformation is underway 
the transformation will move the company from its traditional engineering and technology focus  to a new emphasis on sales and marketing 
management s energies and the company s resources will be refocused on these objectives 
management is also sharpening its focus on its platform strategy to capitalize on additional market opportunities 
historically  the company s growth has been generated through a combination of internal growth and acquisition of new products or complementary technologies 
in october  the company acquired a portion of intel corporation s communications platform group for its chassis and computing products 
in january  the company acquired certain assets of mapletree networks  inc  for its voice processing technology 
there are identifiable risks associated with carrying out the company s growth strategy in the current uncertain economic climate 
many of the company s end markets are forecasted to show only modest growth in the near term 
in order to realize growth in this environment  the company will have to gain market share from competitors  many of whom are larger  more established companies with greater resources than the company 
management believes that the company s strategy to hire additional sales people while continuing to invest in new product development will enable the company to compete in this economic environment 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
key performance indicators the company s communications platforms and systems are incorporated into current and next generation embedded systems infrastructure 
traditionally  design wins have been an important metric for management to judge the company s product acceptance in its marketplace 
design wins  if successfully implemented by our customers  reach production volumes at varying rates  generally beginning twelve to eighteen months after the design win occurs 
a variety of risks such as schedule delays  cancellations  changes in customer markets and economic conditions can adversely affect a design win before production is reached  or during deployment 
the company modified its criteria for the measurement of design wins in to provide greater granularity in predicting forward looking potential for the company and to assist in measuring day to day execution of product  sales and marketing programs 
during  the company was notified of design wins for its products with each expected to generate greater than 
million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
these new design wins were for its integrated platform solutions with multiple products  and individual component design wins for communications and switch products 
during  the company was notified of design wins for its products with each expected to generate greater than 
million of annualized revenue when reaching production volumes 
these design wins were for the company s integrated platform solutions with multiple products  and individual component design wins for communications and switch products 
not all design wins are expected to result in production orders 
the company believes that the growth in the number of design wins from to reflects increasing customer demand for the company s products 
management believes another key indicator for the company s business is the volume of orders received from its customers 
during weak economic periods  customers visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
shipments to customers in amounted to million  compared to million in revenue in was negatively impacted by two large customers who purchased million of product in  but stopped buying product from the company in  primarily due to demand issues in their markets for their specific products 
this loss of revenue was partially offset by increased sales to new and existing customers in industry overview the company s customers are primarily equipment manufacturers in the telecommunications  data communications  defense and homeland security and commercial markets 
throughout  the company s customers focused their efforts and spending on new product development  but are operating with scaled down business models caused by the market contraction in recent years 
while many new smaller communications suppliers are reappearing  it is a common trend that across the technology sector  many organizations continued with lean staffs and tightened cost controls 
this includes many of the company s customers and suppliers 
industry market research organizations are estimating the total available market for worldwide  embedded systems to be valued at billion in size in traditionally  the largest segment of this market uses proprietary  purpose built embedded systems and products 
embedded systems built on open standards comprise about  or billion representing the company s served available market 
while proprietary systems are expected to continue to dominate this market in the future  a growing share of embedded systems being implemented  especially in the more limited markets served by the company  is expected to use open standards based products 
the driving factors behind this changing paradigm are twofold 
first  systems are becoming increasingly integrated and more complex  requiring larger investments and longer lead times to design 
second  as organizations have downsized over the past several years  they have not replaced the necessary staff to carry out extensive new product development while successfully meeting the competitive pressures of time to market found in most technology businesses 
due to these changes  telecom and data communications equipment manufacturers appear to be increasing their reliance on companies such as performance technologies to deliver major building blocks or complete platforms  allowing the supplier to layer on their value add which has become software and or additional hardware elements directed at specific applications 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  economic environment and the company s initiatives for financial overview revenue revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in the decrease in revenue of million was primarily the result of two significant customers that ceased purchasing product from the company in in  these two customers  andrew corporation and utstarcom  together represented million of total revenue  compared to zero revenue in the decrease in sales to these two customers was partially offset by increases in sales to new and existing customers in shipments to customers outside of the united states represented and of sales in and  respectively 
this increase was due to the company s continued sales efforts in foreign markets  including a significant customer in the united kingdom 
in  shipments to the united kingdom represented of revenue 
in  shipments to the uk were less than of revenue

net income in amounted to million  or 
per diluted share based on million shares outstanding 
non gaap information upon the recording of certain non recurring items  the company will calculate and report its results excluding these items from its gaap net income to arrive at a non gaap measure of net income 
management believes that the presentation and disclosure of this non gaap net income measure provides another view of the operations and financial condition of the company on the basis in which management operates the company and the board of directors reviews its results 
this non gaap net income measure is calculated by adjusting net income reported on a gaap basis for items that the company deems to be non recurring and unusual or infrequent in their nature 
the company adjusts for these non recurring items as these items are excluded from the company s operational analysis  budgeting and forecasting functions 
the use of this non gaap measure by the company could result in potential limitations related to possible bank lending covenant violations  where certain covenants may be measured on gaap results 
the company compensates for this potential limitation by attempting to enter into lending agreements under which covenants are calculated utilizing the company s non gaap net income measure 
on december   the company entered into a million senior revolving credit facility with a bank 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the company is subject to certain financial covenants that will be calculated utilizing the company s non gaap measure described above 
in the future  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its efforts to obtain additional lending arrangements under which certain covenants are calculated utilizing the non gaap net income measure described above 
there was no difference between gaap net income and non gaap net income for non gaap net income in amounted to million  or 
per diluted share excluding non recurring items based on million shares outstanding 
for  the following non recurring items affected the comparability of net income between years o in process research and development costs related to the mapletree networks  inc acquisition 
million  or

acquisitions  equity investments and notes receivable mapletree networks  inc subsequently  the voice technology group  or vtg in january  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of mapletree networks  inc  a company that provided voice  data and fax processing technology to original equipment manufacturers 
the initial investment consisted of cash and the assumption of certain debt at closing of million and other acquisition costs of 
million 
during the fourth quarter  the company resolved certain matters related to the acquisition resulting in a payment to the company of approximately million  which represented a partial return of purchase price 
the company s revenue and expenses reflect the operations of vtg from the date of acquisition 
in january  the company announced its plan to close the vtg engineering center and transfer product development and customer support for the voice technology products to other company engineering centers 
momentum computer  inc momentum momentum is a developer of specialized single board computer products 
the company initially acquired a ownership interest in momentum in during  the company reduced its ownership in momentum to 
based upon the company s expectations of momentum s performance at the time of the investment and its business prospects in late  the company concluded that an other than temporary impairment of this investment occurred and the company recorded an impairment charge of 
million for this investment during the fourth quarter during the third quarter  the company completed the sale of its investment in momentum for million and realized a gain of million 
cash received in the fourth quarter from the sale amounted to million  including the collection of a million note receivable 
inscitek microsystems  inc inscitek in february  the company entered into an agreement to invest up to million in inscitek in the form of an interest bearing convertible note receivable 
during  the company invested million in conjunction with this agreement including funding of 
million in january 
as of december   inscitek had not raised sufficient outside capital to assure its future as a going concern 
therefore  during the fourth quarter  the company recorded a valuation charge related to this note receivable in the amount of million as collection of this note was doubtful 
the note bore interest at annually and was convertible into shares of common stock of inscitek 
during the third quarter  inscitek received an investment from an outside party through the sale of series a preferred stock 
in connection with that investment  the company and inscitek renegotiated the terms of the note and all unpaid interest due to the company at the date of the investment  amounting to

during the third quarter  the transition of the manufacturing functions into the rochester manufacturing operation was completed  resulting in anticipated savings of 
million per year 
during and  the company incurred charges of 
million and 
million  respectively  related to these restructuring efforts 
management expects a portion of the savings realized under this plan will be reinvested to stimulate future growth 
on january   the company announced a plan to close its engineering center in norwood  massachusetts and transfer product development and customer support for the voice technology products to other company engineering centers 
in connection with the assessment of the voice technology product s software development  the company recorded a charge in the fourth quarter to write off software development costs that were capitalized for new voice technology products which had not reached commercial general release and were discontinued 
this intangible asset write off amounted to million 
during the first half of  management expects to relocate its san luis obispo engineering group to more cost effective office space in the san luis obispo area and its ottawa operations to a suburban location in the ottawa area 
management expects that the preponderance of these actions will be completed during the first half of results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of sales  included as an aid to understanding the company s results  and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

total revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in for the years indicated  the company s products are grouped into four distinct categories in one market segment communications network access  signaling and voice acquired in january products  computing products  switching products and other products 
revenue from each product category is expressed as a percentage of sales for and as follows communications computing switching other total communications products communications products are comprised of network access  segway signaling and voice technology products 
network access products provide a connection between a variety of voice  data and signaling networks and embedded systems platforms that are used to control the network and or process information being transported over networks 
this family includes a complete line of communications protocols 
many of the company s signaling products provide a signaling bridge between traditional telephone networks and the growing ip packet switched network  and enable the transport of signaling messages over ip networks 
voice technology products enable voice  data and fax processing for communications applications 
communications product revenue for totaled million  which represented a decrease of 
million  or  from million in this decrease in revenue in reflects one major customer representing million in that  due to industry consolidation activity  unexpectedly ceased product requirements in the second quarter this decrease was partially offset by shipments to several new and existing customers in computing products computing products include integrated platform solutions  a range of single board computers  a variety of embedded system chassis and associated chassis management products 
computing products revenue in totaled million  compared to million in the decrease in revenue of million  or  reflects two major customers representing million in  that due to market conditions  ceased purchasing product by the end of in  several customers partially offset the lack of shipments to the two customers 
switching products the company s ethernet switch components operate as the nexus of the ip packet switching functionality of the advanced managed platforms 
in  switching products revenue amounted to million  compared to million in the increase in revenue of million  or  was attributable to increased sales to a variety of switch customers 
other products this revenue is primarily related to legacy products 
many of these products are project oriented and shipments can fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of sales  less cost of goods sold including material costs  manufacturing expenses  depreciation  amortization of software development costs  and expenses associated with engineering contracts and the technical support function 
gross margin was and of sales for and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin was a result of a change in product mix from lower margin products computing products to higher margin products communications and switching products  and cost reductions related to the consolidation of the company s manufacturing operations 
lower production volumes in resulted in fixed manufacturing costs being spread over fewer units which negatively impacted the gross margin improvements noted above 
included in cost of goods sold is the amortization of software development costs which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
total operating expenses 
total operating expenses for amounted to million  compared to million in the operating expenses of the voice technology group vtg are included from the date of acquisition of january  operating expenses in included the write off of software development costs amounting to million
