item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the five largest radio broadcasting companies in the united states based on revenues 
we operate in markets  including boston  seattle  denver  sacramento  portland  kansas city  indianapolis  milwaukee  new orleans  norfolk  buffalo  memphis  providence  greensboro  rochester  greenville spartanburg  madison  wichita  wilkes barre scranton and gainesville ocala 
a radio broadcasting company derives its revenues primarily from the sale of broadcasting time to local and national advertisers 
the advertising rates that a radio station is able to charge and the number of advertisements that can be broadcast largely determine those revenues 
advertising rates are primarily based on four factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by periodic reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  both nationally and in the regions in which the station operates  and the market s size based upon available radio advertising revenue 
in  we generated of our net revenues from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each individual local radio station s sales staff  and from national advertising  which is sold by independent advertising sales representatives 
we generated the balance of our revenues principally from network compensation  promotional activities  sales on our stations websites and rental income from tower sites 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee compensation  and programming and promotional expenses 
several factors may adversely affect a radio broadcasting company s performance in any given period 
in the radio broadcasting industry  seasonal revenue fluctuations are common and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
typically  revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
as opportunities arise  we may  on a selective basis  change or modify a station s format due to changes in listeners tastes or changes in a competitor s format 
this could have an immediate negative impact on a station s ratings and or revenues and there are no guarantees that the modification or change will be beneficial at some future time 
our management is continually focused on these opportunities as well as the risks and associated uncertainties 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public 
we strive to develop compelling content and strong brand images to maximize audience ratings that are crucial to our stations financial success 
our results of operations include net revenues and station operating expenses from station we own and those net revenues and station operating expenses recognized under a time brokerage agreement or similar sales agreement for stations operated by us prior to acquiring the stations 
depending on the facts and circumstances relating to each pending asset purchase agreement eg  whether or not there is an associated time brokerage agreement or similar agreement and the provisions of financial interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 which would include any variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary  we may include the assets and liabilities  of the entity holding the assets to be acquired  in our consolidated balance sheet  and the net revenues and station operating expenses  of the entity holding the assets to be acquired  in our consolidated statement of operations 
more information on this interpretation by the financial accounting standards board fasb is described in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following results of operations include a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and a discussion of the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our results of operations represent the operations of the radio stations owned or operated pursuant to time brokerage agreements or joint sales agreements during the relevant periods 
we discuss net revenues  station operating expenses and operating income by comparing the performance of stations owned or operated by us throughout a relevant year to the performance of those same stations in the prior year whether or not owned or operated by us 
included in the comparisons that follow under the heading same station considerations is summary information regarding significant contracts that relate to station operations  have a significant effect on the net revenues and or station operating expenses of a particular market  and we account for as separate business units 
we use these comparisons to assess the performance of our operations by analyzing the effect of acquisitions and dispositions of stations and changes in status of significant contracts on net revenues and station operating expenses throughout the periods measured 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the following significant factors affected our results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year acquisitions on october   we acquired for million three radio stations in greenville  south carolina  which  in  increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense  on september   we acquired for million three radio stations in indianapolis  indiana  that we began operating on june  under a time brokerage agreement  which  in  increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and interest expense and decreased our time brokerage agreement fees  on june   we acquired for million a radio station in providence  rhode island  that we began operating on april  under a time brokerage agreement  which  in  increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense  and on may   we acquired for million a radio station in buffalo  new york  which  in  increased our net revenues  station operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense

other  including changes in significant contracts hurricane katrina and its aftermath severely impacted the operations of our radio stations in new orleans  which  in  resulted in million of expenses related to a natural disaster  and on january   we restructured our agreement with the seattle seahawks  effective with the start of the national football league season  which eliminated our production of the games and our selling of the advertising time which  in  decreased our net revenues and station operating expenses 
financing under four authorized share repurchase programs  we repurchased our shares of class a common stock in for an aggregate amount of million and in for an aggregate amount of million  which  in  increased our interest expense due to an increase in borrowings under our senior credit facility to finance the repurchase of our stock  and on august   we entered into a new credit facility  which  in  increased interest expense due to an increase in the fees associated with an increase in the funds available under the facility and  in  resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt 
net revenues december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change our indianapolis market  which we began operating on june  under a time brokerage agreement  together with our boston  sacramento  providence and buffalo markets  contributed to our overall net revenues increase 
most of our markets realized an improvement in net revenues  which was partially offset by declines in a few of our markets 
net revenues in were negatively impacted by our restructured agreement with the seattle seahawks  effective with the start of the national football league season  which eliminated our sale of advertising time and our production of the games  a reduction in political advertising in compared to  and early elimination in of the boston red sox from post season play with three post season games as compared to post season games in  that reduced the number of games available to sell advertising under our boston red sox agreement

the increase in operating income was partially offset by i an increase in corporate general and administrative expenses of million to million in from million in  due to the factors described above  ii expenses of million in related to the effects of hurricane katrina  and iii an increase in depreciation and amortization of million to million in from million in  due to the factors described above

interest expense december  december  dollars in millions interest expense amount of change percentage change the increase in interest expense in was due to an increase in interest rates on outstanding debt and higher average outstanding debt used to finance the repurchases of our stock in and in in the amounts of million and million  respectively  and radio station acquisitions in the amounts of million in and million in interest expense included amortization of deferred financing costs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  income before income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income before income taxes amount of change percentage change the increase in income before income taxes in was mainly attributable to a net gain on sale or disposal of assets to million in from a loss of million in  for the reasons described above under operating income  an improvement in in net revenues  net of an increase in station operating expenses  for the reasons described above  a net gain on investments of million in as compared to a loss of million  primarily from the disposition of available for sale securities  and the absence in of a loss on extinguishment of debt as compared to a million loss on extinguishment of debt in  from the refinancing of our former senior credit facility in the third quarter of income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income taxes amount of change percentage change the increase in income taxes in was a result of increased income before income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was in as compared to in the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were million and million  respectively  for as compared to million and million  respectively  for our deferred tax liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 on january   we no longer amortize our fcc licenses for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
as our fcc licenses continue to amortize for tax purposes  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect a significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
in  our expected annual effective tax rate  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  will be approximately 
our effective tax rate may be materially impacted by any or all of the following changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  changes in the statutes and rules applicable to taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in the expected outcome of tax audits  changes in the estimate of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes  and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance

dispositions on november   we entered into an agreement to dispose of four radio stations in longview  washington  for million  that the buyer began operating on november  under a time brokerage agreement  which  in  decreased our net revenues and station operating expenses for stations owned and operated during these periods as we had not operated these stations for the entire year  on july   we entered into an agreement to dispose of a radio station in seattle  washington  that the buyer began operating on december  under a time brokerage agreement  which  in  decreased our net revenues and station operating expenses for stations owned and operated during these periods as we had not operated this station for the entire year  on december   we recognized a gain on the sale of assets of million from the disposal of a parcel of land for million  which in resulted in a relative reduction compared to of our gains and losses on the sale of assets  on november   we disposed of a radio station in portland  oregon  for million  which in  reduced our net revenues  station operating expenses  interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains on the sale of assets  and in october  our agreement for the rights to broadcast the games of a major league sports team expired  which in reduced our net revenues and station operating expenses 
financing in  under authorized share repurchase programs  we repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of million using additional borrowings under our senior credit facility  which in increased our interest expense  on august   we entered into a new credit facility  which in increased interest expense and resulted in the recognition of a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the write off of deferred financing costs  derivatives designated as cash flow hedges with total notional amounts of million expired during  which in lowered interest expense as these derivatives had increased our effective interest rate on our senior debt  and on april   subsequent to the conversion of million of our convertible preferred securities  term income deferrable equity securities tides into million shares of our class a common stock  we redeemed million of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures  which in decreased our interest expense 
net revenues december  december  dollars in millions net revenues amount of change percentage change the increase in net revenues in was primarily due to the effect of radio station acquisitions during the period and our sales and brand initiatives 
most of our markets realized an improvement in net revenues with our boston  denver  sacramento and norfolk markets contributing most to our overall net revenues increase 
indianapolis and providence  our two new markets in  also contributed to our overall net revenues increase 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in net revenues in our kansas city market due to the expiration of a sports team contract in and a decrease in net revenues in our new orleans market due to a general market decline in available advertising dollars for the media sector 
in and in  we generated and  respectively  of our net revenues from local advertising  and and  respectively  from national advertising

the decrease in interest expense in was attributable to the conversion to shares of our class a common stock and the redemption for cash in april of million in tides

income taxes december  december  dollars in millions income taxes amount of change percentage change the increase in income taxes in was a result of increased income before income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate in was a result of a reduction in the benefits realized in connection with certain state tax planning strategies 
the current and deferred portions of our income tax expense were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  our deferred tax liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the deferred tax liability primarily relates to differences between book and tax bases of our fcc licenses 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas on january   we no longer amortize our fcc licenses for financial statement purposes  but instead test them annually for impairment 
as our fcc licenses continue to amortize for tax purposes  our deferred tax liability will increase over time 
we do not expect the significant portion of our deferred tax liability to reverse over time unless our fcc licenses become impaired  or our fcc licenses are sold for cash  which would typically only occur in connection with the sale of the assets of a station or groups of stations or the entire company in a taxable transaction 
our effective tax rate may be materially impacted by any or all of the following changes in the level of income in any of our taxing jurisdictions  changes in the statutes and rules applicable to taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  changes from the outcome of tax audits  changes in the estimate of expenses that are not tax deductible for tax purposes  and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
net income december  december  dollars in millions net income amount of change percentage change the increase in net income in was primarily attributable to the reasons described above under income before income taxes and accounting change  net of income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources during we used a portion of our capital resources to repurchase shares of our class a common stock under our share repurchase programs see liquidity and capital resources  share repurchase programs below and to consummate radio station acquisitions 
generally  our acquisitions  share repurchases  reductions of our outstanding debt and other capital requirements are funded from one or a combination of the following sources our credit agreement  the issuance and sale of securities  internally generated cash flow  and the swapping of our radio stations in transactions that qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code 
since becoming a public company in january  our board of directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend of per share at its february meeting see part ii  item for a discussion of dividends 
our bank revolver on august   we entered into a bank credit agreement  or bank revolver  with a syndicate of banks  for a five year senior secured revolving credit facility of million 
we used million from the bank revolver to pay all principal outstanding under our former credit facility 
the bank revolver is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock and other equity interest in all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the bank revolver requires us to comply with certain financial covenants and leverage ratios  which are defined terms within the agreement  including total debt to operating cash flow  operating cash flow to interest expense  and operating cash flow to fixed charges 
upon the occurrence of certain events  our interest rate can increase to a maximum of the eurodollar rate plus or prime rate plus 
the interest payable on the eurodollar rate is payable at the end of the selected duration 
we also pay a commitment fee that varies depending on certain financial covenants and the amount of the unused commitment  to a maximum of per annum  on the average unused balance of the bank revolver 
management believes we are in compliance with all financial covenants and leverage ratios and all other terms of the bank revolver 
our senior subordinated notes on march   we issued million of senior subordinated notes  or notes  due march  and we received net proceeds of million 
interest on the notes  which are in denominations of  each  accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september we may redeem the notes on and after march  at an initial redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the notes are unsecured and rank junior to our senior indebtedness 
our senior subordinated notes also require us to comply with certain covenants that limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness and to make certain payments 
the covenants under the senior subordinated notes  in general  are less restrictive than the covenants under the bank revolver 
liquidity our liquidity requirements are for working capital and general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  and any one or more of the following repurchases of our class a common stock  dividends and acquisitions 
in  we expect that we will continue to make quarterly estimated federal and state income tax payments based upon expected quarterly taxable income 
during the year ended december   we paid million in income taxes that included estimated federal and certain state taxes for and certain state taxes for capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in and million in we anticipate that capital expenditures in will consist of between million and million incurred during the ordinary course of business and for the conversion of our remaining fm stations to digital radio  and between million and million for the consolidation and relocation of our studio facilities in several of our markets 
as of december   we had credit available of million under the bank revolver  subject to compliance with the covenants under the bank revolver at the time of borrowing 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december  we increased our net outstanding debt by million  primarily to fund our repurchase of shares in the amount of million and the purchase of radio station assets in the amount of million 
as of december   we had outstanding million in senior debt  including million under our bank revolver  million in a letter of credit  and million in senior subordinated notes 
we may seek to obtain other funding or additional financing from time to time 
we believe that cash on hand and cash from operating activities  together with available borrowings under the bank revolver  will be sufficient to permit us to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future  including cash to fund our operations and any acquisitions  repurchases of our stock and any dividends that may be declared 
our bank revolver requires that at the time of closing on acquisitions  we must be in compliance with the terms of the bank revolver 
we believe that we will maintain compliance with the terms of our bank revolver 
if we are not in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in amending the bank revolver or entering into a new credit agreement  obtaining additional financing or that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  which could delay or impair our efforts to consummate future acquisitions 
failure to comply with our financial covenants or other terms of the bank revolver could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our outstanding debt 
our ability to meet our financial obligations could be adversely impacted by factors such as prolonged downturns in the economy  poor performance by our stations  increased competition from other media and other factors that could be a result of world events 
in addition  we may require additional financing for future acquisitions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms considered favorable by us or at all 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities were affected by increased advertising revenues  net of increased station operating expenses and increased income taxes which  in each case  were affected by the acquisitions and dispositions of stations during those periods 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to million for the year ended december  compared to a million decrease for the year ended december   primarily due to the recording of unfunded share repurchase obligations of million as of december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by an elimination from net income of a gain on dispositions and exchanges of assets of million for the year ended december   primarily from the disposition of a station in seattle  an elimination from net income of a million net gain on investments for the year ended december   and a decrease in deferred taxes of million  primarily from the expiration of certain bonus depreciation tax incentives that were not available for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million increase in net income to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was partially offset primarily by a reduction in deferred taxes of million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the use  in  and the absence  in  of available net operating loss carry forwards 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflect acquisitions of radio station assets of million  offset by the proceeds of million from the sale of investments 
the net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflect acquisitions of radio station assets of million 
the net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  reflect acquisitions of radio station assets of million net of a decrease in station acquisition deposits and costs of million 
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflect the repurchase of million of our class a common stock and a net increase in outstanding indebtedness of million 
the net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflect the repurchase of million of our class a common stock  a net increase in outstanding indebtedness of million  and deferred financing expense of million related to our new credit facility 
the net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  reflect a net reduction in outstanding indebtedness of million 
credit rating agencies on a continuing basis  credit rating agencies such as moody s investor services and standard and poor s evaluate our debt in order to assign a credit rating 
as a result of their reviews  our credit rating could change 
any significant downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact our future liquidity 
the effect of a change in our credit rating may limit or eliminate our ability to obtain debt financing  or include  among other things  interest rate changes under any future bank facilities  debentures  notes or other types of debt 
share repurchase programs on december   march   november   and may   our board of directors authorized one year share repurchase programs of up to million of our class a common stock for each program 
under these repurchase programs  we repurchased and immediately retired in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share  and in  million shares for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
during the period subsequent to december  and as of february   we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
depending on market conditions and other factors  these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time without prior notice 
as of february   million remained authorized as available for repurchase 
we expect to use cash available under our bank revolver and internally generated cash flow as a source of funds to repurchase shares under the remaining program 
our former credit agreement on august   we used the proceeds of million from the bank revolver to prepay all of the outstanding debt under our former credit facility or prior facility 
the prior facility  which was entered into on december  with a syndicate of banks  initially provided for senior secured credit of million that consisted of a million reducing revolving credit facility  and a million multi draw term loan 
the prior facility  which had a maturity date of september   reduced on a quarterly basis that began on september   in quarterly amounts that varied from million to million for each loan 
contractual obligations the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities a the maturity on our bank revolver  with outstanding debt in the amount of million as of december   could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
b under our million senior subordinated notes  the maturity could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain covenants or could be repaid in cash by us at our option prior to the due date of the notes 
the above table includes projected interest expense under the remaining term of the agreement 
a in connection with extensive litigation  on may   we acquired a radio station for a purchase price of million  which included an award by the court of million in damages as an offset against the original million purchase price 
a successful appeal by the seller could reverse the million in damages awarded by the court 
b we have liabilities of million related to i construction obligations of million in connection with the relocation and consolidation of certain of our studio facilities  ii our obligation of million to provide a letter of credit  and iii an obligation of million to increase our interest in a partnership carried as an investment 
c in addition to the above  purchase obligations of million primarily include contracts for on air personalities  sports programming rights  ratings services  music licensing fees  television advertising  equipment maintenance and certain other operating contracts 
included within total other long term liabilities of million are deferred income tax liabilities of million that are recognized for all temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and our operating results 
as a result  it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  deferred income tax liabilities have been reflected in the above table in the column labeled as more than years 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize letters of credit to back certain payment and performance obligations 
letters of credit are subject to limits based on amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
an outstanding letter of credit of million as of december  was immaterial 
we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes at december  accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recently issued pronouncements fsp no 
fas r on november   the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment award 
this election provides for alternative transition methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool 
the purpose of the apic pool is to determine the excess tax benefits related to share based payment awards that will be available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of statement no

we computed our apic pool as of december  without the use of this transition election see recently issued pronouncements sfas no

fsp no 
fas on october   the fasb issued fsp no 
fas that addresses the accounting for rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period 
under fsp no 
fas  rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period  shall be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations 
the guidance in this fsp shall be applied effective january  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp no 
fas will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
eitf issue no 
at a june meeting of the fasb  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or acquired subsequent to lease inception should be based on the lesser of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the period of the lease including all renewal periods that are reasonably assured of exercise at the time of the acquisition 
the consensus was applied prospectively to leasehold improvements acquired subsequent to the eitf ratification date of june  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
in addition  another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb opinion no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made by us beginning january  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fin on march   the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies when an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by this interpretation are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin  which also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  was effective for the year ended december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sab no 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
to assist in the implementation challenges of sfas no 
r and to enhance the information provided to investors 
sab no 
creates a framework that is premised on two themes considerable judgment is required by a company to successfully implement sfas no 
r  and reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
accordingly  situations in which there is only one acceptable fair value estimate are expected to be rare 
sfas no 
r in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  as revised  share based payment 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the scope of sfas no 
r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in their financial statements the compensation expense relating to share based payment transactions that would include all stock options that have future vesting provisions  as modified  or as newly granted beginning on the grant date of such options 
prior to the effective date of this revision  sfas no 
permitted entities the option of applying the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to the financial statements disclosed what net income loss would have been had we used the preferable fair value based method 
sfas no 
r  which was adopted by us on january   will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we are unable to quantify the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r at this time as the impact will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as cash flow from financing activities see recently issued pronouncements fsp no 
fas r 
in periods after adoption  this requirement will increase cash flows from financing activities and reduce cash flows from operating activities 
we cannot estimate these amounts as it depends on when employees exercise their outstanding stock options and the price of our stock at the time of exercise 
if we had adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
on december   we accelerated the vesting of unvested out of the money options with grant dates prior to january  and with exercise prices above per share that were held by employees  officers and directors 
the primary purpose of accelerating the vesting was to avoid recognizing pretax stock based compensation expense of million in future periods under sfas no 
r for those out of the money options with exercise prices that exceeded the december  market value of the underlying stock 
the exercise prices were greater than the december  closing price of of our class a common stock on the new york stock exchange 
the vesting of options to purchase approximately million shares of our class a common stock with exercise prices that ranged from per share to per share  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  were accelerated  including options to purchase  shares held by our executive officers and options to purchase  shares held by our non employee directors 
all other terms of the awards  however  remain unchanged 
the acceleration of vesting on unvested options did not impact the computation of earnings per share for the year ended december  the acceleration may impact  however  the employee exercise patterns in future periods 
additional pretax expense of million associated with the acceleration was included in the pro forma disclosure at december  for the pre tax expense effect by year on future periods for unvested stock options outstanding as of december   see note in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
we have elected that the modified prospective application method without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption will be used as our implementation strategy 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different circumstances or by using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be important in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
based upon past experience  the use of these estimates has been a reliable method to recognize revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make payments to us 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances 
for the year ended december   we increased our accounts receivable reserve for our new orleans radio stations due to the impact on our operations of hurricane katrina and its aftermath  including the flooding of the majority of the city of new orleans for a period of time  the evacuation of its residents and the cessation of day to day commerce 
excluding the effect of the increase in our new orleans accounts receivable reserve  our historical reserves averaged less than of our outstanding receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  then additional allowances could be required 
the effect of an increase in our allowance of of our outstanding receivables as of december   from to or million to million  would result in a decrease in net income of million  net of taxes net income per share diluted of  for the year ended december  radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we had recorded approximately billion in radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the recorded value of these assets is more than their fair value 
we believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets and our estimate of the value contains assumptions incorporating variables that are based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
these variables would include but not be limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses and goodwill assets 
see note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of the impact of a natural disaster on the fair value of the fcc licenses and goodwill in our new orleans radio market 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposure related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
estimation of effective tax rates significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
tax contingencies are also recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining if a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimates of the value of our tax contingencies and valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates as they contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
our estimate of our effective tax rates has not changed significantly in past years  with rates that ranged from to 
the effect of a increase in our estimated tax rates  as of december   would result in an increase in income tax expense of million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense would result in a decrease in net income of million net income per share diluted of for the year ended december  valuation of stock options we determine the fair value of our employee stock options at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from these traded options 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and expected term of the options granted 
we have used historical data for our stock price and option life when determining expected volatility and expected term  but each year we reassess whether or not historical data is representative of expected results 
the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our employee stock options  at the date of grant  could be impacted by the guidance under sab no 
and could result in a material increase in the fair value of future grants 
intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of the risks associated with the renewal of licenses 
inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for radio station operating expenses  including wages and equipment 
the exact impact is indeterminable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank revolver 
under certain covenants that are measured periodically  we may be required from time to time to protect ourselves from interest rate fluctuations through the use of derivative rate hedging instruments 
if the borrowing rates under libor were to increase above the rates as of december   our interest expense under our bank revolver would increase by approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of outstanding derivative rate hedging instruments 
we do not have interest rate risk related to our senior subordinated notes  which have a fixed interest rate of 
as of december   we had a derivative rate hedging transaction in place for a notional amount of million that effectively fixes libor at and expires in the fair value of the rate hedging transaction at december   based upon current market rates  is included as derivative instruments in other long term liabilities according to the maturity date of the instrument 
our rate hedging transaction is tied to the three month libor interest rate  which may fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
the fair value of the hedging transaction is affected by a combination of several factors  including the change in the three month libor rate and the forward interest rate to maturity 
any increase in the three month libor rate and or the forward interest rate to maturity results in a more favorable valuation  while any decrease in the three month libor rate and or forward interest rate to maturity results in a less favorable valuation 
our derivative instrument liability as of december  was million  which represented a decrease of million from the balance as of december  this decrease was due primarily to an increase in the forward interest rates to maturity  and a decrease of one year in the remaining period of our outstanding hedge 
our credit exposure under this hedging agreement  or similar agreements we may enter into in the future  is the cost of replacing an agreement in the event of non performance by our counter party 
to minimize this risk  we select high credit quality counter parties 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counter parties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counter parties nonperformance 
our cash equivalents are money market instruments consisting of short term government securities and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by government securities 
we do not believe that we have any material credit exposure with respect to these assets 
our credit exposure related to our accounts receivable does not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the high percentage of local business  the multiple markets in which we operate and the wide variety of advertisers
