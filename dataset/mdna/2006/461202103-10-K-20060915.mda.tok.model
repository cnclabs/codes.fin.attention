overview of financial results total net revenue for fiscal was billion  up compared with fiscal three quarters of the fiscal revenue increase was due to growth in our consumer tax and payroll and payments segments 
consumer tax revenue was higher in fiscal  driven by a increase in federal turbotax online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing 
we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software  rather than manual methods  to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business 
payroll and payments revenue was higher in fiscal  with combined payroll offerings accounting for slightly more than half of the increase and merchant services representing slightly less than half of the increase 
see total net revenue below for additional information 
we recorded operating income from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal operating income from continuing operations for fiscal was reduced by million in pre tax share based compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we recorded as a result of our adoption of sfas r on august  the revenue growth that we experienced in fiscal was partially offset by these share based compensation expenses and by higher spending for new product development  marketing and customer support 
our net income from continuing operations of million for fiscal was flat compared with million for fiscal our net income from continuing operations for fiscal would have been approximately million lower if it had included pro forma share based compensation expense and excluded certain discrete tax benefits 
diluted net income per share from continuing operations of for fiscal increased compared with for fiscal due to the net reduction in average shares outstanding 
average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the issuance of shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in december we sold our intuit information technology solutions its business for approximately million in cash 
the decision to sell its was a result of our desire to focus resources on our core products and services 
we recorded total net income from its discontinued operations of million or per diluted share for fiscal  including million or per share for the net gain on disposal of that business 
in may we sold our master builder construction management software and solutions business  which was part of intuit construction business solutions in our other businesses segment 
the master builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately million 
we recorded a million net loss on disposal of the business  including income tax expense of million 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation 
we ended fiscal with cash and investments totaling billion 
in fiscal we generated cash from continuing operations  from the sale of our its business and from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
in this period we used million in cash for repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
at july   authorized funds of million remained available for stock repurchases 
seasonality our quickbooks  consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal 
some of our other offerings are also seasonal  but to a lesser extent 
revenue from many of our small business software products  including quickbooks  tends to be concentrated around calendar year end 
sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
as a result  our total net revenue is 
table of contents usually highest during our second quarter ending january and third quarter ending april we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october and fourth quarter ending july  when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 
critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form k with the audit committee of our board of directors 
net revenue revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  software subscriptions  product support  professional services  payroll services  merchant services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see net revenue in note to the financial statements 
we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
in connection with the sale of certain products  we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers 
we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant 
the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent 
net revenue return and rebate reserves as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if 
table of contents actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our fiscal total net revenue would have been million lower 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million on goodwill associated with our intuit public sector solutions business  which was subsequently sold 
at july  we had million in goodwill and million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 
accounting for share based compensation plans prior to august   we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our equity incentive plan or its predecessor plans prior to august  as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
table of contents transition and disclosure  we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs 
effective august   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b period compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model 
prior to that  we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before august   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
this is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before august  for our pro forma disclosures under sfas for options granted on or after august   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
in may we began a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting activities and related accounting treatment 
our board of directors formed a special committee of independent directors to conduct this review with the assistance of independent legal counsel and independent forensic accounting support 
the primary scope of this review covered the period from august  to the present 
on august  we announced the completion of our independent review  which uncovered no evidence of fraud or intentional wrongdoing in our historical stock option granting practices 
see item  legal proceedings  and note to the financial statements 
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when we prepare our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be 
if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period 
as a result  our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results 
this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 
our net deferred tax asset at july  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase

consumer tax revenue was higher in fiscal  driven by a increase in federal turbotax online units sold and to a lesser extent by growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing 
payroll and payments revenue increased in fiscal see total net revenue below for additional information 
effective august   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognized for the twelve months ended july  included a period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b period compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in fiscal we recorded pre tax share based compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million or per diluted share as a result of our adoption of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of years 
excluding the share based compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan that we recorded in accordance with sfas r  higher revenue in fiscal was partially offset by higher expenses of approximately million for new product development and approximately million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately  compared with approximately for fiscal in fiscal our effective tax rate benefited from the reversal of approximately million in reserves related to potential income tax exposures that were resolved 
if we had excluded these and other discrete tax benefits from our fiscal effective tax rate  our effective tax rate for fiscal would have been approximately five percentage points higher and our net income from continuing operations for that period would have been approximately million lower 
our diluted net income per share from continuing operations increased more rapidly than our net income from continuing operations in fiscal due to the net reduction of average shares outstanding 
average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of million shares under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the issuance of million shares in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in december we sold our intuit information technology solutions its business for approximately million in cash 
the buyer deposited approximately million of the total purchase price in a third party escrow account to be held through december to cover breaches of representations and warranties set forth in the purchase agreement  should they arise 
the full escrow amount is included in other current assets on our balance sheet at july  we recorded total net income from its discontinued operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal  including million or per diluted share for the net gain on disposal of that business 
in may we sold our master builder construction management software and solutions business  which was part of intuit construction business solutions in our other businesses segment 
the master builder business had quarterly revenue of approximately million 
we recorded a million net loss on disposal of the business  including income tax expense of million 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we have not accounted for this transaction as a discontinued operation 
at july   our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled billion  an increase of million from july  in fiscal we generated million in cash from continuing operations  approximately million in cash from the sale of our its business and million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
during the same period  we repurchased million shares of our common stock under our repurchase programs at an average price of for a total price of million 
at july   authorized funds of million remained available for stock repurchases 

table of contents total net revenue the table below and the discussion of total net revenue that follows it are organized in accordance with our five reportable business segments 
see note to the financial statements for descriptions of product  service and other revenue for each segment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our business 
we transferred our quickbooks payroll and merchant services businesses from our fiscal quickbooks related segment to a new segment called payroll and payments and renamed our quickbooks related segment quickbooks 
we also transferred our outsourced payroll business from our fiscal intuit branded small business segment to the new payroll and payments segment 
finally  we transferred the remaining businesses in our fiscal intuit branded small business segment to our other businesses segment 
we made no changes to our consumer tax and professional tax segments

table of contents total net revenue by business segment quickbooks fiscal compared with fiscal quickbooks total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal total quickbooks software unit sales were up in fiscal compared with fiscal this higher unit volume more than offset lower average selling prices for quickbooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of upgrade rebates 
we believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements  successful execution of our quickbooks product launch and growth in the category that was driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant 
fiscal compared with fiscal quickbooks total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal on higher unit volume resulting from an increase in new customers and on proportionately more sales of our higher priced products favorable product mix 
payroll and payments fiscal compared with fiscal payroll and payments total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase 
quickbooks payroll revenue was higher in fiscal compared with fiscal because of a combination of favorable product mix  growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal revenue from our other payroll offerings increased in fiscal  driven by growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll and complete payroll customers processing payrolls  price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers  partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base 
merchant services revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to growth in the customer base and higher transaction volume per customer in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal payroll and payments total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal our merchant services accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal revenue increase while our combined payroll offerings represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase 
the increase in merchant services revenue was due to growth in the customer base  higher transaction volume per customer and our discontinuation of the outsourcing of certain merchant processing services beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal we completed the transition to recognizing the full revenue from processing merchant transactions that were formerly processed through two major banks rather than the smaller profit sharing fees we would have received under our prior arrangement with those banks 
we recorded fees for outsourced merchant processing services as other revenue while we recorded fees for merchant processing services we perform ourselves as service revenue 
quickbooks payroll revenue was higher in fiscal compared with fiscal because of growth in the customer base  price increases and the successful launch of our higher priced enhanced payroll offering  including its bundling with unspecified quickbooks software upgrades 
revenue from our other payroll businesses increased in fiscal  driven by growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll and complete payroll customers processing payrolls  price increases and higher interest income on funds held for payroll customers  partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base 
consumer tax fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal paid federal turbotax unit sales were up in fiscal  driven by a increase in federal turbotax online units sold which accounted for the majority of the revenue increase for that period 
to a lesser extent  higher fiscal revenue was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing 
we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of both online and desktop software  rather than manual methods  to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business 
we also believe that fiscal consumer tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products 
these changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal due to higher federal turbotax online units and to volume and price increases in electronic filing and other attach services 
professional tax fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal due to overall growth in the professional tax customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings 
fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal due to an increase in lacerte product revenue driven by improved customer retention rates and to bank product transmission services volume from our new proseries express product 
other businesses fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal quicken revenue was lower in fiscal canadian revenue increased in fiscal due to strong growth in sales of quickbooks products and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal quicken revenue was higher in fiscal due to growth in our bill payment customer base

fiscal compared with fiscal cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue was the same in fiscal compared with fiscal growth in turbotax units came disproportionately through our web turbotax offer  which has lower costs per unit than our desktop offerings

in fiscal total operating expenses also increased by approximately million for new product development and approximately million for additional advertising and other marketing programs and improved customer support service levels  particularly in our quickbooks and consumer tax segments 
excluding the impact of share based compensation expense  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue declined due to lower direct selling costs associated with our fiscal focus on the retail channel 
we continue to invest in research and development and expect that our fiscal research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenue will be higher than they were in fiscal total operating expenses in dollars increased million in fiscal compared with fiscal due to spending for infrastructure  implementation of our new information systems  new product development and promotion  and sarbanes oxley compliance

table of contents at july  we had net deferred tax assets of million  which included a valuation allowance of million for certain state capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards 
the allowance reflects management s assessment that we may not receive the benefit of certain loss carryforwards in certain state jurisdictions 
while we believe our current valuation allowance is sufficient  it may be necessary to increase this amount if it becomes more likely that we will not realize a greater portion of the net deferred tax assets 
we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis

sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas on august  and we do not expect our adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas  accounting for certain hybrid instruments in february the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid instruments  which amends sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers 
our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market or cash management funds  we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 
the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds 
approximately of our available for sale debt securities have an interest reset date  put date or mandatory call date within one year

years ending july  and in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents investments total 
table of contents interest rate risk our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents  investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by or about basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million

impact of foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenue  costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period 
we report translation gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of operations 
since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars and british pounds into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
