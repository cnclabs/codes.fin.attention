item a 
risk factors 
the following are certain risks that management believes are specific to peoples business 
this should not be viewed as an all inclusive list or in any particular order 
o changes in interest rates may adversely affect peoples profitability 
peoples earnings are dependent to a significant degree on net interest income  which is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond peoples control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest peoples receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i peoples ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of peoples financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of peoples mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  peoples net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
management uses various measures to monitor interest rate risk and believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on peoples results of operations 
management also periodically adjusts the mix of assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk 
however  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on peoples financial condition and results of operations 
see the sections captioned interest income and expense and interest rate risk and liquidity in item of this form k for further discussion related to peoples interest rate risk 
o peoples exposure to credit risk could adversely affect peoples earnings and financial condition 
there are certain risks inherent in making loans 
these risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid  risks resulting from changes in the economy  risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and  in the case of loans secured by collateral  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 
commercial and commercial real estate loans comprise a significant portion of peoples loan portfolio 
commercial loans generally are viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn 
since peoples loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans  and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on peoples earnings and financial condition 
o peoples allowance for loan losses may be insufficient 
peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses based on management s quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio 
there can be no assurance on the timing or amount of actual loan losses or that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review peoples allowance for loan losses as part of their examination process and may require management to increase the allowance or recognize further loan charge offs based on judgments different than those of management 
any increase in the provision for loan losses would decrease peoples pretax and net income 
o adverse economic conditions may adversely impact peoples results of operations 
peoples success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the specific local markets in which it operates 
the local economies of peoples market area historically have been less robust than the economy of the nation as a whole and are not subject to the same fluctuations as the national economy 
adverse economic conditions in peoples market area  including the loss of certain significant employers  could reduce peoples growth rate  affect its borrowers ability to repay their loans and generally affect peoples financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  a downturn in real estate values in peoples market area could cause many of its loans to become inadequately collateralized 
o the financial services industry is very competitive 
peoples experiences significant competition in originating loans  principally from other commercial banks  savings associations and credit unions 
several of peoples competitors have greater resources  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services 
this competition could reduce peoples net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that it originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans 
for a more complete discussion of peoples competitive environment  see business competition in item of this form k 
if peoples is unable to compete effectively  peoples will lose market share and income from deposits  loans and other products may be reduced 
o peoples ability to pay dividends is limited 
peoples is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
peoples receives nearly all of its revenue from dividends from peoples bank  which are limited by federal banking laws and regulations 
these dividends also serve as the primary source of funds to pay dividends on peoples common shares and interest and principal on peoples debt 
the inability of peoples bank to pay sufficient dividends to peoples could have a material  adverse effect on peoples business 
further discussion of peoples ability to pay dividends can be found under the caption supervision and regulation limits on dividends in item of this form k and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
o government regulation significantly affects our business 
the banking industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law 
peoples is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board  and peoples bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds  not peoples shareholders 
peoples non bank subsidiaries are also subject to the supervision of the federal reserve board  in addition to other regulatory and self regulatory agencies including the securities and exchange commission and state securities and insurance regulators 
regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous change  and management cannot predict the effect of those changes 
regulations and laws may be modified at any time  and new legislation may be enacted that affects peoples and its subsidiaries 
any modifications or new laws could adversely affect peoples business 
further information about government regulation of peoples business can be found under the caption supervision and regulation in item of this form k 
o peoples and its subsidiaries are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  peoples and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding positions taken in their tax returns 
state tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions  especially those positions relating to tax compliance and calculation of taxes subject to apportionment 
any challenge or examination by a tax authority may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
while management believes it has taken appropriate positions on the tax returns filed  any examination or challenge made that is not resolved in our favor could have a material adverse effect on peoples financial condition and results of operation 
peoples bank is currently undergoing an examination by the ohio department of taxation of its ohio corporation franchise tax reports 
management has agreed to a one year extension of the statue of limitations for the year 
however  the administrative process is not yet complete and peoples bank has not received a notice of any proposed adjustment 
due to the fact the ohio department of taxation is in the early stages of its administrative process  management cannot accurately make an estimate of potential exposure  if any  although no assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of this examination will not have a material impact on peoples financial condition and results of operation 
o anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control by a third party 
provisions in the ohio general corporation law and peoples amended articles of incorporation and code of regulations  including a staggered board and a supermajority vote requirement for significant corporate changes  could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by shareholders to remove peoples board of directors and management more difficult 
these provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a transaction or change in control that might be in the best interests of peoples shareholders

in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters  peoples cannot state what the eventual outcome of any such matters will be  however  based on current knowledge and after consultation with legal counsel  management believes that these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity of peoples

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements of peoples bancorp inc and subsidiaries peoples is presented to provide insight into management s assessment of the financial results 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  as well as the ratios and statistics  contained elsewhere in this form k 
references will be found in this form k to the following transactions that have impacted or will impact peoples results of operations o as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  peop completed the acquisition of putnam agency  inc putnam on april  and barengo insurance agency  inc bareng on may   collectively  the insurance agency acquisitions 
in addition  peoples bank acquired two full servic banking offices in the ashland  kentucky area at the close of business on december  the ashland banking acquisition 
in conjunction with the ashland banking acquisition  peoples bank consolidated two of its existing office the ashland area market into other peoples bank offices and closed one of the acquired offices 
in  peoples acquire kentucky bancshares incorporated kentucky bancshares  the holding company of kentucky bank trust  and closed two of peoples bank s existing offices  due to the proximity of the acquired offices 
o on december   the compensation committee of the board of directors of peoples bancorp inc peoples bancorp approved the acceleration of the vesting schedule with regard to all unvested stock options previously granted to employees of peoples and its subsidiaries  including executive officers of peoples  and subsidiary directors pursuant to peoples various stock option plans the stock option acceleration 
no unvested stock options held by directors of peoples bancorp were accelerated 
as a result  an aggregate of  options became exercisable as of that date 
peoples recorded a one time  non cash compensation expense of  in due to the stock option acceleration 
o on december   peoples bancorp announced the authorization to repurchase up to  or approximately  of peoples bancorp s outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the stock repurchase program 
peoples bancorp repurchased a total of  common shares or of the total authorized under the stock repurchase program  at an average price of per share 
the repurchased common shares are held as treasury shares and are to be used for future exercises of options granted under peoples bancorp s stock option plans  future issuances of common shares in connection with peoples bancorp s deferred compensation plans and other general corporate purposes 
the stock repurchase program expired on december  o in december  peoples sold approximately million of fixed rate securities  consisting primarily of mortgage backed securities purchased in a historically low interest rate environment  and reinvested the net proceeds in other investment securities  primarily variable rate mortgage backed securities the investment portfolio repositioning 
the securities sold were selected because management wanted to shorten the estimated life of the portfolio and expected those securities selected to underperform in a rising rate environment 
while the investment portfolio repositioning had a minimal impact on short term yields  the new securities have shorter estimated lives and duration and better cash flow characteristics in a rising rate environment than the securities sold 
o in december  peoples bank sold its credit card portfolio to inficorp holdings  inc inficorp 
in addition to the sale  peoples bank and inficorp entered into a joint marketing agreement to serve the credit card needs of peoples customers and prospective customers 
o in december  peoples sold million of mortgage backed investment securities due to the high rate of prepayments on those securities and the corresponding downward pressure on yields from accelerated amortization of bond premiums 
peoples reinvested the proceeds from the sales into other mortgage backed securities that were anticipated to produce a higher yield with estimated lives similar to those of the securities that were sold collectively  the investment portfolio restructuring 
approximately million of the reinvestment settled in late december and the remaining reinvestment of approximately million settled in late january o on december   peoples prepaid million of long term  convertible rate borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb and reborrowed the funds using a short term  repurchase agreement advance collectively  the long term debt restructuring 
peoples incurred prepayment penalties totaling million as part of this transaction 
the prepaid borrowings had a weighted average rate of and weighted average remaining maturity of years 
the new short term advance had a significantly lower initial interest rate  yet had somewhat similar interest rate sensitivity characteristics in a rising interest rate environment 
o on december   peoples bancorp announced the authorization to repurchase up to  or approximately  of peoples bancorp s outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
on august   peoples bancorp announced the authorization to repurchase an additional  shares  or approximately  of peoples bancorp s outstanding common shares in from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions collectively  the stock repurchase program 
peoples bancorp repurchased  common shares or of the total authorized under the stock repurchase program  at an average price of 
peoples bancorp has reissued  of the repurchased shares in connection with stock option exercises in and and the insurance agency acquisitions 
the remaining repurchased shares  which are held as treasury shares  are anticipated to be used for future exercises of stock options granted under peoples stock option plans  issuances of common shares for peoples bancorp s deferred compensation plans  and other general corporate purposes 
the stock repurchase program expired on december  the impact of these transactions  where significant  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of peoples conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and to general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of peoples consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
income recognition interest income on loans and investment securities is recognized by methods that result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding  including yield adjustments resulting from the amortization of loan costs and premiums on investment securities and accretion of loan fees and discounts on investment securities 
since mortgage backed securities comprise a sizable portion of peoples investment portfolio  a significant increase in principal payments on those securities could negatively impact interest income due to the corresponding acceleration of premium amortization 
in the event management believes collection of all or a portion of contractual interest on a loan has become doubtful  which generally occurs after the loan is days past due  peoples discontinues the accrual of interest 
in addition  previously accrued interest deemed uncollectible that was recognized in income in the current year is reversed  while amounts recognized in income in the prior year are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan is restored to accrual status after appropriate review by lending and or loan review personnel indicates the collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer considered doubtful 
allowance for loan losses in general  determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and estimation of the losses that have been incurred within the loan portfolio 
this formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types and resulting provision for loan losses by considering factors affecting losses  including specific losses  levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  current national and local economic conditions  volume  growth and composition of the portfolio  regulatory guidance and other relevant factors 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance 
the provision could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management s formal analysis 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses for the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships and historical loss experience for each category of homogeneous loans 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  which consists primarily of nonaccrual and restructured loans 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the allowance is available for all loan losses 
individual loan reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria  including the size of the loan  the loan cash flow characteristics  loan quality ratings  value of collateral  repayment ability of borrowers  and historical experience factors 
the historical experience factors utilized for individual loan reviews are based upon past loss experience  known trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  personal loans  etc 
are evaluated based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in each lending market 
consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans  the allowance relating to the overdraft privilege program is based upon management s monthly analysis of accounts in the program 
this analysis considers factors that could affect losses on existing accounts  including historical loss experience and length of overdraft 
there can be no assurance the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses  but management believes the allowance for loan losses of million at december   is adequate to provide for probable losses from existing loans based on information currently available 
while management uses available information to provide for loan losses  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio  and the need for future additions to the allowance  will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors 
as such  adverse changes in economic activity could reduce cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers  which would likely cause peoples to experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies and losses on loans 
investment securities investment securities represent the second largest component of peoples assets  accounting for of total assets at december  presently  peoples classifies its entire investment portfolio as available for sale and records changes in the estimated fair value of the portfolio in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
as a result  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio  due to changes in market interest rates  investor confidence and other factors affecting market values  than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
while temporary changes in the market value of available for sale securities are not recognized in earnings  a decline in fair value below amortized cost deemed to be other than temporary results in an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment  with a corresponding loss charged against earnings 
management systematically evaluates peoples investment securities on a quarterly basis to identify potential other than temporary losses 
this analysis requires management to consider various factors that can involve judgment and estimation  including duration and magnitude of the decline in value  the financial condition of the issuer  and peoples ability and intent to continue holding the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   there were no investment securities identified by management to be other than temporarily impaired 
if investments decline in fair value due to adverse changes in the financial markets  additional charges to income could occur in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets over the past several years  peoples has grown through mergers and acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  peoples is required to allocate the cost of an acquired company to the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
at december   peoples had million of identifiable intangible assets acquired in acquisitions  subject to amortization  and million of goodwill  not subject to periodic amortization 
the determination of fair value and subsequent allocation of the cost of an acquired company generally involves management making estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
in addition  the valuation and amortization of intangible assets representing the present value of future net income to be earned from customers commonly referred to as customer relationship intangibles or core deposit intangibles requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
while management feels the assumptions and variables used to value recent acquisitions were reasonable  the use of different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce materially different results 
customer relationship intangibles are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
since peoples acquired customer relationships are subject to routine customer attrition  the relationships are more likely to produce greater benefits in the near term than in the long term  which typically supports the use of an accelerated method of amortization for the related intangible assets 
management is required to evaluate the useful life of customer relationship intangibles to determine if events or circumstances warrant a change in the estimated life 
should management determine in future periods the estimated life of any intangible asset is shorter than originally estimated  peoples would adjust the amortization of that asset  which could increase future amortization expense 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
goodwill recorded by peoples in connection with its acquisitions relates to the inherent value in the businesses acquired and this value is dependent upon peoples ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a competitive market place 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
peoples has reviewed its recorded goodwill and concluded that no indicators of impairment existed as of december  however  future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and re evaluate goodwill 
if such re evaluation indicated impairment  peoples would recognize the loss  if any 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material  adverse impact on peoples financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes income taxes are provided based on the liability method of accounting 
the calculation of tax liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgment since it involves the application of complex tax laws that are subject to different interpretations by peoples and the various tax authorities 
these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law 
from time to time and in the ordinary course of business  peoples is involved in inquiries and reviews by tax authorities that normally require management to provide supplemental information to support certain tax positions taken by peoples in its tax returns 
management believes that it has taken appropriate positions on its tax returns  although the ultimate outcome of any tax review cannot be predicted with certainty 
to the extent management determines additional taxes may be due  peoples recognizes liabilities for such tax exposures when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses peoples tax exposures based on the most recent information available and adjusts the related liability as deemed prudent and necessary 
no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the current and historical financial statements 
results of operation overview of the income statement in  peoples net income was  or per diluted share  up from  or per diluted share  a year ago 
this improvement is due in large part to balance sheet restructuring and other charges of  after tax or per diluted share that occurred in return on average equity improved to in  from a year ago  while return on average assets was and in and  respectively 
in december  peoples determined that the yearly amount of lump sum payments to participants from peoples defined benefit pension plan during exceeded the allowable threshold of annual service cost plus interest and  accordingly  settlement charges of   after tax  or per diluted share should have been reflected in the results for the second quarter of although peoples deems the impact of the settlement charge on its financial statements to be immaterial  it has revised second quarter results and reduced second quarter net income per share by 
these amounts are more fully presented in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
for the year ended december   net interest income improved to million  compared to million for the same period in  due to earning asset growth and the related interest income that more than exceeded the increase in interest bearing liabilities and associated funding costs 
net interest margin dropped seven basis points to in as a result of the flattening yield curve 
other income totaled million compared to million a year ago and was up due primarily to increased insurance commissions of million attributable to the insurance agency acquisitions 
other income was also impacted by securities transactions and asset disposals  which resulted in a net gain of million in versus a net loss of million in in  other expense grew to million  from million for the year ended december  a full year s impact of the costs attributable to the insurance agency acquisitions accounted for much of this increase 
interest income and expense peoples earns interest income on loans and investments and incurs interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income  the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense  remains peoples largest source of revenue 
the amount of net interest income earned by peoples is affected by various factors  including changes in both market interest rates due to the federal reserve board s monetary policy  the level and degree of pricing competition for both in market loans and deposits and the amount and composition of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
peoples monitors net interest income performance and manages its balance sheet mix through regular asset liability committee alco meetings 
the asset liability management process employed by the alco is intended to minimize the impact of future interest rate changes on peoples earnings 
however  the frequency and or magnitude of changes in market interest rates are difficult to predict  much less react to  and may have a greater impact on net interest income than adjustments by management 
further discussion of peoples interest rate risk management can be found later in this discussion under the caption interest rate risk and liquidity 
as part of the analysis of net interest income  management converts tax exempt income to the pre tax equivalent of taxable income using an effective tax rate of 
management believes the resulting fully tax equivalent fte net interest income allows for a more meaningful comparison of tax exempt income and yields to their taxable equivalents 
net interest margin  calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets  serves as the primary measure used in evaluating the net revenue stream generated by the mix and pricing of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table details the calculation of fte net interest income and margin for the years ended december dollars in thousands net interest income  as reported    taxable equivalent adjustments    fully tax equivalent net interest income    average earning assets    net interest margin since mid  the federal reserve s open market committee has increased the target fed funds rate basis points through year end  causing short term market interest rates to increase 
during the same period  longer term market interest rates have risen at a much slower pace  compressing the difference between short term and longer term interest rates 
this flattening of the yield curve  coupled with intense competition for loans and deposits  have been factors in the compression of the net interest margins for many financial institutions in  and peoples is no exception 
for the year ended december   the fte yield on earning assets of was a basis point improvement over s average yield of 
however  the average interest cost of earning assets increased basis points to in  from in in the second half of  peoples experienced some improvement in asset yields from upward repricing of certain variable rate loans and origination of new loans at current market rates 
in the fourth quarter of  peoples net interest margin improved basis points  versus the prior quarter and basis points over s fourth quarter 
the fte yield on earning assets was for the fourth quarter of  compared to and for the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  respectively  while the average interest cost of earning assets was  and  for the same periods  respectively 
net loans comprise the largest portion of peoples earning assets  averaging billion in  compared to million in the increased loan volume in is largely the result of commercial loan originations and loans acquired in the ashland banking acquisition 
the fte yield on net loans was in  versus a year ago 
loan yields have increased in due to new loans being originated at higher rates  coupled with repricing of variable rate  prime based loans as a result of the federal reserve s action to increase interest rates  although competition for commercial loans and repayment of higher rate loans have tempered these improvements 
investment securities averaged million in  down from million last year  with fte yields of and  respectively 
the decrease in average balances from a year ago is largely attributable to management using a portion of the principal runoff to manage liquidity  fund loan growth and for other corporate purposes 
peoples interest bearing liabilities averaged billion in  at an average cost of  up from billion and average cost of last year 
traditional deposits comprise the majority of peoples interest bearing liabilities  averaging million for the year ended december   compared to million a year ago 
the higher volume of deposits was due primarily to the impact of deposits acquired in the ashland banking acquisition and additional brokered deposits 
in  the average cost of interest bearing deposits was  up from in competition for deposits has both impacted peoples ability to retain some deposits and increased the overall cost of interest bearing deposits 
in the fourth quarter of  average interest bearing deposits dropped to million  from million  while the average cost increased basis points to 
peoples also utilizes a variety of borrowings as complementary funding sources to traditional deposits 
in  total borrowed funds averaged million compared to million in peoples overall cost of borrowed funds increased to in  from last year  due to higher short term rates resulting from the federal reserve s actions to increase the federal funds rate 
advances from the fhlb  both short term and long term  remain a key source of funding for asset growth  as well as a means of managing peoples interest rate risk 
peoples also accesses wholesale repurchase agreements and other borrowings from unrelated institutions to diversify funding sources 
while included in borrowed funds  peoples retail repurchase agreements are marketed and managed as a cash management tool for commercial customers that maintain higher balances and have a need for a daily interest bearing sweep account 
additional information regarding peoples borrowed funds can be found later in this discussion under the caption financial condition funding sources 
the following details the average balance and rate of peoples borrowed funds dollars in thousands average rate average average balance balance rate balance rate short term borrowings fhlb advances    retail repurchase agreements    other short term borrowings  total short term borrowings    long term borrowings fhlb advances    wholesale repurchase agreements    other long term borrowings    total long term borrowings    the higher level of short term fhlb advances compared to prior years was partially attributable to peoples replacing other longer term borrowings with short term advances 
management  at times  will use longer term fhlb borrowings to match fund selected three and five year adjustable rate commercial loans with advances that have similar amortization and repricing characteristics 
the average cost of peoples borrowed funds has steadily increased since mid in response to the federal reserve s action to increase rates 
management may make adjustments to the mix of borrowed funds in the future  as deemed desirable  to manage liquidity and position the balance sheet for potential changes in interest rates 
even with the challenges of the current interest rate environment and intense competition for loans and deposits  peoples experienced some improvement in asset yields in the latter half of due to repricing of variable rate loans and reinvestments of investment portfolio cash flows into higher yielding securities 
however  management believes net interest margin compression could occur in the first half of due to various factors  including the current slope of the yield curve and an increase in rates in the first half of for funding to replace certain maturing liabilities 
still  management is taking steps to adjust the mix of peoples balance sheet with the goal of minimizing the impact of future interest rate changes on net interest income 
at december   peoples interest rate risk position and asset liability simulations indicate that an immediate and sustained increase in both short term and long term interest rates would reduce net interest income 
management does not believe such shifts are representative of actual changes that occur in the yield curve 
consequently  peoples net interest margin and income remain difficult to predict and manage 
provision for loan losses peoples provision for loan losses was  in  down from  in the prior year 
the lower overall provision was the based on management s quarterly evaluation of the loan portfolio and estimation of losses incurred and is directionally consistent with peoples loan quality and recent loss experience net of recoveries of previously charged off loans 
a portion of the provision relates to the overdraft privilege program  which totaled  in  compared to  in when expressed as a percentage of average loans  the provision was in compared to in management believes the provisions were appropriate for the overall quality  inherent risk and volume concentrations of peoples loan portfolio 
future provisions will continue to be based on management s quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
gains and or losses on securities transactions in  peoples recognized a net gain of  on investment securities transactions compared to a net loss of  a year ago 
the net gain in was largely attributable to the sale of two separate equity investments in unaffiliated companies due to changes in their corporate structure 
the net loss in was largely the result of the investment portfolio repositioning during the fourth quarter  coupled with the  other than temporary impairment charge on fannie mae preferred stock 
non interest income peoples generates non interest income from six primary sources deposit account service charges  fiduciary activities  investment and insurance commissions  electronic banking e banking  mortgage banking and business owned life insurance boli 
in recent years  peoples has focused on reducing its reliance on net interest income by growing non interest income  especially fee based revenues not affected by interest rate changes 
non interest income  which excludes gains and losses on securities transactions and asset disposals  grew in and accounted for of total revenues  compared to in and in non interest income growth also occurred in as a result of increased insurance revenues of million attributable to the insurance agency acquisitions 
service charges and other fees on deposit accounts  which are based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided  are peoples largest source of non interest income 
for the year ended december   deposit account service charges totaled  compared to  in management periodically evaluates its cost recovery fees to ensure they are reasonable based on operational costs  as well as similar to fees charged in peoples markets by competitors 
the following table details peoples deposit account service charges dollars in thousands overdraft fees    non sufficient funds fees    other fees and charges    total    insurance and investment commissions are also a significant component of peoples non interest income  totaling  in versus  in this increase was the result of higher insurance commissions  primarily from sales of property and casualty insurance  due to a full year s impact of the insurance agency acquisitions completed in mid the following table details peoples insurance and investment commissions dollars in thousands property and casualty insurance   life and health insurance brokerage fixed annuities credit life and a h insurance total    peoples e banking services include atm and debit cards  direct deposit services and internet banking and serve as alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to clients 
for the year ended december   peoples e banking income was up over the prior year total 
peoples e banking revenues have remained strong due in large part to an increase in the number of debit cards issued to customers and higher volumes of debit card activity 
at december   peoples had  cards issued  with of all eligible deposit accounts having a debit card  compared to  cards and a penetration rate a year ago 
peoples customers used their debit cards to complete million of transactions in  up from million a year ago 
peoples mortgage banking involves the origination and selling of long term  fixed rate real estate loans into the secondary market 
the amount of associated revenue recognized is dependent largely on customer demand for long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
in  mortgage banking produced revenues of  compared to  in the prior year 
the reduction in mortgage banking income is attributable to peoples sale of million in fixed rate loans  acquired in the ashland banking acquisition in the first quarter of the sale  which was due to the loans associated interest rate risk  resulted in a net loss of  peoples boli investment enhances operating efficiency by offsetting rising employee benefit costs 
in  boli produced modestly lower income due to the impact of a flatter yield curve on the associated investment funds 
still  management believes boli continues to provide a better long term vehicle for funding future benefit costs  and offsetting the related expense  than alternative investment opportunities with similar risk characteristics 
non interest expense in  non interest expense totaled  up from  a year ago 
a full year s impact of costs associated with the insurance agency acquisitions accounted for million of additional expense in  primarily salaries and benefits expense  occupancy and equipment costs and intangible amortization 
salaries and benefits remain peoples largest non interest expense  which is inherent in a service based industry such as financial services  totaling  and  in and  respectively 
a full year s impact of the insurance agency acquisitions comprised million  or of the overall increase 
peoples also incurred higher sales related compensation of million  while costs related to peoples defined benefit pension plan and performance based incentive plan each grew million 
in the fourth quarter of  salaries and benefits were down compared to the third quarter of and fourth quarter of  decreasing and  respectively 
lower medical insurance costs were the key driver of the reduction in fourth quarter salaries and benefits 
fourth quarter salaries and benefits also included non cash compensation expense of  relating to the acceleration of certain stock options on december  management expects salaries and benefits to be modestly higher in  as medical insurance costs return to more historic levels and normal annual salary adjustments are made 
for the year ended december   net occupancy and equipment expense totaled  versus  a year ago 
this increase was largely attributable to higher utility  maintenance and lease costs of  which were partially offset by lower depreciation expense of  the decline in depreciation expense was attributable to existing assets becoming fully depreciated  coupled with fewer shorter lived assets  such as computers and other office equipment  being placed in service 
intangible asset amortization expense grew in  due to a full year s amortization of the customer relationship intangibles acquired in the insurance agency acquisitions and core deposit intangibles from the ashland banking acquisition 
since peoples uses an accelerated method of amortization for its customer related intangibles  amortization expense will be lower in subsequent years based on the intangible assets included on peoples consolidated balance sheet at december  professional fees  which include accounting  legal and other professional expenses  were up in  totaling  versus  in higher audit fees associated with the new regulatory reporting environment under sarbanes oxley was the primary factor driving the increased professional fees 
marketing expense  which includes the cost of advertising  public relations and charitable contributions  increased in nearly half of this increase is attributable to additional contributions of  to peoples bancorp foundation  inc  an independent non profit entity formed in to make charitable distributions to organizations in peoples primary market areas 
in addition  peoples efforts to promote new deposit products and increase brand awareness in various markets during were contributing reasons for the higher marketing costs 
in  peoples bankcard costs  which consist primarily of debit card and atm processing fees  decreased from the prior year 
even though atm and debit card activity produced modest growth  the expected corresponding increase in costs was offset by a reduction in various transaction based charges beginning in early due to a new processing contract with the existing provider of peoples atm and debit card services 
in the fourth quarter of  bankcard costs totaled  which was down from  for s fourth quarter  but up from  for the third quarter of  due to increased customer activity 
management believes bankcard costs will approximate s fourth quarter expense throughout  based on current customer activity levels 
peoples is subject to franchise taxes  which are based largely on peoples bank s equity at year end  in the states where it has a physical presence 
in  state franchise taxes totaled  up from  in this increase was primarily attributable to additional equity at peoples bank resulting from the insurance agency acquisitions 
management believes that the stronger capital level at peoples bank positions the company for strategic growth opportunities even though there is a negative impact to franchise taxes 
peoples management and board of directors regularly evaluates the capital position of peoples direct and indirect subsidiaries from both a cost and leverage perspective 
ultimately  management seeks to optimize peoples consolidated capital position through allocation of capital  which is intended to enhance profitability and shareholder value 
return on equity in  peoples return on average equity roe was versus in management uses roe to evaluate peoples long term performance  but management believes earnings per share eps serves as a more meaningful measurement of short term performance due to the volatility that can occur in equity from changes in the estimated fair values of peoples investment portfolio 
return on assets return on average assets roa was in compared to a year ago 
in recent years  peoples primary focus has shifted to eps enhancement and roe while reducing the emphasis on roa as a key performance indicator 
however  management continues to monitor roa and considers it a measurement of the effectiveness of peoples asset utilization 
income tax expense in  peoples effective income tax rate was  up from a year ago 
peoples higher effective tax rate in is primarily attributable to higher pre tax income 
a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory tax rate can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
peoples continues to make tax advantaged investments in order to manage its effective tax rate and overall tax burden 
at december   the amount of tax advantaged investments totaled million compared to million at december  depending on economic and regulatory conditions  peoples may make additional investments in various tax credit pools and other tax advantaged assets 
financial condition overview of balance sheet at december   total assets were billion  up million from billion at year end this increase was the result of internal loan growth of million in  with gross loans totaling billion at december  versus billion at december  investment securities totaled million at december  versus million at year end total liabilities were billion at december   compared to billion at year end at december   deposit balances totaled billion  up million from the prior year end  while borrowed funds totaled million  up million from million at december  stockholders equity totaled million at december   versus million at december   an increase of million 
this increase is due to peoples earnings  net of dividends paid  and change in accumulated comprehensive income 
cash and cash equivalents peoples considers cash and cash equivalents to consist of federal funds sold  cash and balances due from banks  interest bearing balances in other institutions and other short term investments that are readily liquid 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to customer activity and peoples liquidity needs 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up million from million at december  cash and balances due from banks comprised the largest portion of peoples cash and cash equivalents  totaling million at year end versus million a year ago 
this increase was due to normal daily fluctuations in the amount of items in process of collection and cash on hand caused by customer activity 
peoples also had federal funds sold of million at december   compared to no funds sold at year end management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  along with the availability of other funding sources  will allow peoples to meet cash obligations  special needs and off balance sheet commitments  such as unfunded loan commitments  undrawn lines of credit  construction loans and letters of credit  as they come due 
peoples will actively manage the principal runoff from the investment and loan portfolios and seek to use those funds productively  based on loan demand and investment opportunities  while maintaining adequate liquidity and acceptable level of borrowings 
further information regarding peoples liquidity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
investment securities at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million compared to million at year end  while the fair market value of the investment portfolio was million and million  respectively 
the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized depreciation of million and a corresponding decrease in peoples equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
in comparison  the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation of million and a corresponding increase in peoples equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
the following table details peoples investment portfolio  at estimated fair value  at december dollars in thousands us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporations    obligations of states and political subdivisions    mortgage backed securities    other securities    total available for sale securities    overall  the composition of peoples investment portfolio at december   was comparable to recent year end portfolios 
peoples investment in mortgage backed securities has declined from the prior year end amount due to management using a portion of the principal runoff to fund loan growth and for other corporate purposes 
management has also reinvested some of the cash flows from mortgage backed securities into us agency and municipal securities to improve the diversification and overall performance of the investment portfolio in a changing rate environment 
additional information regarding the composition of the investment portfolio can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management regularly evaluates the performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio 
in  management plans to utilize a portion of the cash flows from the investment portfolio to fund loan growth or reduce borrowed funds  as deemed appropriate from a net earnings perspective 
while peoples investment portfolio is used to prudently leverage excess capital  it serves  first and foremost  as a means of maintaining liquidity to satisfy cash flow requirements and managing interest rate risk by adjusting the timing of cash flows and repricing of peoples earning assets to mitigate similar changes to peoples interest bearing liabilities 
loans peoples bank originates various types of loans  including commercial  financial and agricultural loans commercial loans  real estate loans and consumer loans  focusing primarily on lending opportunities in central and southeastern ohio  northwestern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets 
at december   gross loans totaled billion  up million compared to year end due to internal loan originations 
commercial real estate loans were the key driver of loan growth in commercial loans  including loans secured by commercial real estate  represent the largest portion of peoples total loan portfolio 
at december   commercial loan balances were million  or of total loans  up million from million  or of total loans  at year end the portion of commercial loan balances secured by commercial real estate  excluding construction loans  totaled million  or of total loans  at december   versus million  or of total loans  at december  future commercial lending activities will be dependent on economic and related conditions  such as general demand for loans in peoples primary markets  interest rates offered by peoples and normal underwriting requirements 
in addition to in market opportunities  peoples will continue to lend selectively to creditworthy customers outside its primary markets 
while commercial loans comprise the largest portion of peoples loan portfolio  generating residential real estate loans remains a major focus of peoples lending efforts  whether the loans are ultimately sold into the secondary market or retained on peoples balance sheet 
at december   real estate loans  which include construction loans but exclude loans secured by commercial real estate  totaled million compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
real estate loans comprised of peoples total loan portfolio at december   versus at year end included in real estate loans are home equity credit line balances of million at december   versus million at december  a shift in client preference for home equity loans over more traditional consumer loans  due in part to peoples marketing and sales efforts  was a driving factor in the higher balance of home equity loans 
growth of real estate loan balances in recent periods has been impacted by customer demand for long term  fixed rate mortgages  which peoples generally sells to the secondary market with servicing rights retained 
in  peoples originated long term  fixed rate mortgage loans  with total loan amounts of million  versus loans  with total loan amounts of million  in at december   peoples was servicing million of real estate loans previously sold to the secondary market compared to million at year end in addition  peoples had million of fixed rate real estate loans held for sale to the secondary market at december  in  consumer loan balances  including overdrafts  grew million  totaling million at december  excluding overdrafts  consumer loans grew million during to million  from million at year end peoples indirect lending area contributed a significant portion of peoples consumer loans and growth  with balances of million and million at december  and  respectively 
peoples ability to maintain  or even grow  consumer loans in future quarters continues to be impacted by strong competition for various types of consumer loans  especially automobile loans  as well as availability of alternative credit products  such as home equity credit lines 
additionally  peoples commitment to originate quality loans based on sound underwriting practices and appropriate loan pricing discipline remains the paramount objective and could limit any future growth loan concentration peoples largest concentration of commercial loans are credits to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  which comprised approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at year end  compared to at december  loans to lodging and lodging related companies also represented a significant portion of peoples commercial loans  comprising of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   versus at year end these lending opportunities typically have arisen due to the growth of these industries in markets served by peoples or in contiguous areas  and also from sales associates efforts to develop these lending relationships 
management believes peoples loans to lodging and lodging related companies  as well as loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  do not pose abnormal risk when compared to risk assumed in other types of lending since these credits have been subjected to peoples normal underwriting standards  which includes an evaluation of the financial strength  market expertise and experience of the borrowers and principals in these business relationships 
in addition  a sizeable portion of the loans to lodging and lodging related companies is spread over various geographic areas and is guaranteed by principals with substantial net worth 
allowance for loan losses peoples allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   down slightly compared to million at year end when expressed as a percentage of total loans  the allowance was at year end  down from at december   a result of loan growth and overall improved asset quality and credit risk profile of the loan portfolio 
in  net charge offs were down compared to  totaling  versus  this decline was attributable to increased recoveries that offset higher charge offs 
net charge offs relating to the overdraft privilege program comprised the largest portion of peoples net charge offs  totaling  in versus  in net charge offs of commercial and real estate loans also comprised a significant portion of net charge offs 
the allowance is allocated among the loan categories based upon the consistent  quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
however  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category 
the following schedule details the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december dollars in thousands percent percent percent allocation of loans allocation of loans allocation of loans of in each of in each of in each allowance category allowance category allowance category for loan to total for loan to total for loan to total losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial    real estate    consumer    overdrafts credit card total    the allowance allocated to commercial loans has increased in recent periods  reflecting the higher credit risk associated with this type of lending and continued growth in this portfolio 
the allowance allocated to the real estate and consumer loan portfolios is based upon peoples allowance methodology for homogeneous pools of loans  which includes a consideration of changes in total balances in those portfolios 
in prior periods  peoples had maintained an allowance for credit cards that reflected an estimate of the loss from the retained recourse on the business cards included in the credit card portfolio sale 
this recourse arrangement expired during the second quarter of  eliminating the need for an allocation for credit cards 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the entire allowance is available for all loan losses existing as of december  asset quality remains a key focus  as management continues to stress quality rather than growth 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled  or of total assets  versus  or of total assets  at year end this decrease was largely the result of peoples selling other real estate owned oreo of  representing the banking offices closed as part of the ashland banking acquisition and transferred to oreo in late a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s contractual effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered impaired was million  of which million were accruing interest and million were nonaccrual loans 
included in this amount were million of impaired loans for which the related allowance for loan losses was million 
the remaining impaired loan balances do not have a related allocation of the allowance for loan losses because the loans have previously been written down  are well secured or possess characteristics indicative of the ability to repay the loan 
in  peoples average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million and interest income of  was recognized on impaired loans during the period  representing of peoples total interest income 
this compares to average impaired loans of approximately million and interest income of  or of peoples total interest income  in funding sources peoples considers a number of sources when evaluating funding needs  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings and long term borrowings 
deposits  both interest bearing and non interest bearing  continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling billion at december  versus billion at year end non interest bearing deposits serve as a core funding source 
at december   non interest bearing deposit balances totaled million  up million compared to the prior year end 
the majority of this increase is attributable to peoples efforts to grow non interest bearing deposits and reduce its reliance on high cost funding 
in addition  peoples implemented a marketing strategy in the fourth quarter of designed to attract new customers and increase non interest bearing deposits 
in november and december  peoples experienced an overall increase in checking account sales over the same periods in  which exceeds the targets set for this program for that period 
since customer activity can result in significant temporary changes in deposit balances at end of periods  management believes a comparison of average balances to be a more meaningful reflection of the trend in non interest bearing deposits 
in  non interest bearing deposits averaged million versus million in  reflecting peoples efforts to increase non interest bearing deposits 
peoples strategies include continued emphasis on core deposit growth in products such as non interest bearing checking accounts 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   compared to million at december   with additional brokered deposits of million accounting for this increase 
intense competition for deposits  particularly certificates of deposits and other high cost deposit funds during this period of rising interest rates  has challenged peoples ability to grow interest bearing deposit balances 
the following details peoples interest bearing deposits at december dollars in thousands retail certificates of deposit    interest bearing transaction accounts    savings accounts    money market deposit accounts    brokered certificates of deposit    total interest bearing deposits    peoples also accesses other funding sources  including short term and long term borrowings  to fund asset growth and satisfy liquidity needs 
advances from the fhlb comprise a sizeable portion of peoples borrowed funds 
typically  short term fhlb advances  consisting of overnight repo advances or variable cash management advances  are used to manage peoples daily liquidity needs since they may be repaid  in whole or part  at anytime without a penalty 
peoples also utilizes a combination of long term fhlb advances to help manage its interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
in most cases  the early repayment of long term fhlb advances requires peoples to incur a prepayment penalty 
in addition to fhlb advances  peoples accesses national market repurchase agreements to diversify its funding sources 
the repurchase agreements may not be repaid prior to maturity and must remain sufficiently collateralized during the entire term 
as a result  a decline in the market value of the investment securities associated with these agreements would require peoples to allocate additional investment securities to these repurchase agreements 
further information regarding peoples management of interest rate sensitivity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
at december   borrowed funds totaled million  up from million at year end fhlb advances represented the largest component of borrowed funds  totaling million and million at year end and  respectively 
in  the amount of wholesale repurchase agreements decreased million  as peoples repaid maturing advances using short term fhlb advances rather than extending the agreements at current market rates 
capital stockholders equity at december   stockholders equity was million  versus million at december   an increase of million  attributable to peoples earnings  net of dividends paid  of million and a reduction in comprehensive income of million 
for the year ended december   peoples declared dividends of million  representing a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to million  and a payout ratio of  a year ago 
while management anticipates peoples continuing its year history of consistent dividend growth in future periods  peoples bancorp s ability to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent upon dividends from peoples bank 
in addition  other restrictions and limitations may prohibit peoples from paying dividends even when sufficient cash is available 
further discussion regarding restrictions on peoples ability to pay future dividends can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  as well as the limits on dividends section under item of this form k 
included in peoples equity is accumulated comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes  which consists of the adjustment for the net unrealized holding gains or loss on available for sale securities 
at december   accumulated comprehensive loss totaled million versus income of million at december   a change of million 
since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples consolidated balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
at december   peoples had treasury stock totaling million compared to million at year end during  peoples repurchased  common shares or of the total authorized  at an average price of per share  under the stock repurchase program  and  common shares  at an average price of  in conjunction with the deferred compensation plan for directors of peoples and subsidiaries 
during the same period  peoples reissued  treasury shares in connection with the insurance agency acquisitions and stock option exercises 
peoples may repurchase additional common shares in as authorized under the stock repurchase program and deemed appropriate by management 
management uses the tangible capital ratio as one measure of the adequacy of peoples equity 
the ratio  defined as tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets  excludes the balance sheet impact of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions 
at december   peoples tangible capital ratio was compared to at december  the higher ratio compared to the prior year end is the result of a increase in tangible equity that exceeded the increase in tangible assets 
in addition to monitoring performance through traditional capital measurements ie  dividend payout ratios and roe  peoples has also complied with the capital adequacy standards mandated by the banking regulators 
peoples and peoples bank were categorized as well capitalized institutions at december   based on the most recent regulatory notification 
further information regarding peoples and peoples bank s risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity while peoples is exposed to various business risks  the risks relating to interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are typically the most complex and dynamic risks that can materially impact future results of operations and financial condition 
the objective of peoples asset liability management alm function is to measure and manage these risks in order to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity and safety 
this objective requires peoples to focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity through its management of the mix of assets and liabilities  their related cash flows and the rates earned and paid on those assets and liabilities 
ultimately  the alm function is intended to guide management in the acquisition and disposition of earning assets and selection of appropriate funding sources 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr is one of the most significant risks for peoples  and the entire financial services industry  primarily arising in the normal course of business of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers  including loans and deposits  as well as the diversity of its own investment portfolio and borrowed funds 
irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples exposure to irr is due primarily to differences in the maturity or repricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  other factors  such as prepayments of loans and investment securities or early withdrawal of deposits  can expose peoples to irr and increase interest costs or reduce revenue streams 
peoples has charged the alco with the overall management of irr 
to this end  the alco has established an irr management policy that sets minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of irr 
the objective of the irr policy is to encourage adherence to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to meet the challenges and opportunities of changing markets 
peoples alco relies on different methods of assessing irr  including simulations  to project future net interest income streams and to monitor the sensitivity of the net present estimated fair value of equity and the difference  or gap  between maturing or repricing rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of irr because it is a dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates and by establishing limits on these estimated changes to net income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate interest rate risks and their potential impact to earnings and the projected fair value of equity 
the modeling process starts with a base case simulation using the current balance sheet and current interest rates held constant for the next twelve months 
alternate scenarios are prepared which illustrate the impact of increasing and decreasing market interest rates 
comparisons produced from the simulation data  showing the changes in net interest income from the base interest rate scenario  illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet structure 
additional simulations  when deemed appropriate or necessary  are prepared using different interest rate scenarios than those used with the base case simulation and or possible changes in balance sheet composition 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case are provided to the alco for review and discussion 
as part of the evaluation of irr  the alco has established limits on changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity 
the alco limits the decrease in net interest income to or less from base case for each basis point shift in interest rates measured over a twelve and twenty four month period 
the alco limits the negative impact on net equity to or less given an immediate and sustained basis points shift in interest rates 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities for specified time periods is known as the gap 
the alco also reviews static gap measures for specific periods focusing on a one year cumulative gap 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets at the date of measurement 
results that are outside of any of these limits will prompt a discussion by the alco of appropriate actions  if any  which should be taken 
at december   peoples one year cumulative gap amount was negative of earning assets  which represented million more in liabilities than assets that are contractually scheduled to reprice or mature during that period 
management believes a portion of interest bearing liabilities are not likely to reprice at their first opportunity  based on current rates and management s control over the pricing of most deposits 
excluding those liabilities  peoples adjusted one year cumulative gap amount at quarter end was negative of earning assets  which represented million more in liabilities than assets that mature or may reprice during the next twelve months 
the following table is provided to illustrate the estimated earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples  on a pre tax basis  at december  dollars in thousands immediate interest rate estimated estimated increase decrease in increase decrease decrease in economic value of basis points in net interest income equity peoples is within the established irr policy limits for all simulations and all scenarios shown in the above table 
the interest rate risk analysis shows that peoples is liability sensitive  which means that increasing interest rates should negatively impact peoples net interest income while decreasing interest rates should positively impact net interest income  based on the assumptions used 
however  the variability of cash flows from the investment and loan portfolios continues to have a significant influence on future net interest income and earnings  especially during periods of changing interest rates 
in addition  many variable rate loans contain features limiting the amount of annual and lifetime changes in interest rates that can mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates 
liquidity in addition to irr management  a primary objective of the alco is to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity 
the alco defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the alco s liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources  both wholesale funding and brokered deposits 
typically  the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided by cash generated from earning assets such as maturities  calls  principal payments and net income from loans and investment securities 
in  cash provided by financing activities totaled million  due primarily to deposit growth of million 
in comparison  in  cash used in financing activities was million as deposits declined million in cash used in investing activities totaled million in versus million last year  primarily due to lower net cash flows from the investment portfolio 
when appropriate  peoples takes advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  national market repurchase agreements and brokered deposits 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that enable peoples to match fund the payment  amortization and pricing characteristics of corresponding earning assets 
at december   peoples had available borrowing capacity of approximately million through these external sources  along with unpledged investment securities of approximately million that can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile funds from liquid assets 
peoples volatile funds consist of deposits that are considered short term in nature along with a variable rate loan from an unrelated institution 
liquid assets include short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
at december   peoples net liquidity position was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  the liquidity position as of december   was within peoples policy limit of negative of total assets 
off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations peoples routinely engages in activities that involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities are part of peoples normal course of business and include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  interest rate contracts  operating leases  long term debt and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing tax credit investments 
traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
these activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of customers and could require peoples to make cash payments to third parties in the event certain specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts represent the extent of peoples exposure in these off balance sheet activities 
however  since certain off balance sheet commitments  particularly standby letters of credit  are expected to expire or only partially be used  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
peoples also enters into interest rate contracts where cash will either be paid to or received from counter parties depending on changes in interest rates 
peoples utilizes interest rate contracts to help manage the risk of changing interest rates 
interest rate contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
as a result  the amounts recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid or received under these contracts 
peoples also has commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing tax credit funds  consisting of a pool of low income housing projects 
as a limited partner in these funds  peoples receives federal income tax benefits  which assist peoples in managing its overall tax burden 
since the future contributions are conditioned on certain future events occurring  the total amount of delayed equity contributions is not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet at december  further information regarding peoples delayed equity contributions can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management does not anticipate peoples current off balance sheet activities will have a material impact on future results of operations and financial condition based on past experience 
further information regarding peoples financial instruments with off balance sheet risk can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
peoples continues to lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with terms providing for fixed monthly payments over periods ranging from two to ten years 
many of peoples leased facilities are inside retail shopping centers and  as a result  are not available for purchase 
management believes these leased facilities increase peoples visibility within its markets and afford sales associates additional access to current and potential clients 
the following table details the aggregate amount of future payments peoples is required to make under certain contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands more less than than total year years years years long term debt      operating leases     time deposits     total      amounts reflect the minimum principal payments required under peoples long term debt agreements 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
as a result  inflation does not impact peoples to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
the opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices 
in the banking industry  monetary assets typically exceed monetary liabilities 
the current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels 
therefore  inflation has had little impact on peoples net assets 
future outlook peoples results reflect continued growth and positive trends in key areas  including strong loan production  modest improvement in net interest income and stable levels of non interest expense 
management expects interest rate challenges will persist in  due to continued competition for both loans and deposits and the flatter slope of the yield curve 
to offset some of the expected compression in net interest margin  peoples is taking steps to adjust the balance sheet mix by funding loan growth using cash flows from  and gradually reducing the level of  the investment portfolio 
another key focus of peoples in is growth of core deposit funding sources in order to reduce the reliance on higher costing wholesale funding 
initial results from the deposit growth marketing campaign established in early fourth quarter are encouraging 
while sales efforts have exceeded the program s target for november and december  the challenge in will be to build on this success by developing long term relationships and uncovering other financial needs of these new customers 
peoples sales associates are also focused on expanding relationships with existing customers  working to deliver the right financial products and services to peoples growing customer base 
loan growth remains a key component of peoples long term strategic goals 
management believes some lending opportunities exist in peoples markets  although some significant commercial loan payoffs are expected to occur in first half of  as customers move loans to the capital markets or directly to investors  such as insurance companies  for long term  fixed rate pricing 
consequently  loan growth will be challenged in the early parts of the year  and management expects loan growth to be  at best  flat in the early part of  as lenders diligently work to originate quality loans in sufficient volume to offset this expected runoff 
in recent years  peoples has been successful at growing its business and revenues through strategic acquisitions and expansion 
economic conditions in several markets served by peoples remain vibrant  and  consequently management believes attractive opportunities for above average growth potential exist in these markets 
in  management will continue to evaluate possible opportunities to expand peoples presence in focus markets  such as lancaster  ohio and huntington  west virginia  and open new full service banking offices 
ultimately  any future expansion will be driven by growth opportunities in both deposits and loans 
peoples capital position remains at levels management believes will support balance sheet growth opportunities 
while the need to generate short term results is understood  management believes its disciplined  long term approach to improving earnings through diversification of the revenue base will allow peoples to build the greatest value for shareholders 
peoples remains a service oriented company with a sales focus that strives to satisfy clients through a relationship sales process 
through this process  sales associates work to anticipate  uncover  and solve their clients every financial need  from insurance to banking to investment services

comparison of to results of operation in  peoples net income totaled million  or per diluted share  up from million  or per diluted share  in the increase was the result of higher non interest revenues of million  which more than offset the million increase in non interest expense and million decrease in net interest income 
return on average equity improved to in  from in  while return on average assets was and for the same periods  respectively 
balance sheet restructuring and other charges reduced earnings in both and in december  peoples recorded a loss on sale of securities totaling  or  after tax relating to the repositioning of a portion the investment portfolio  a write down of   after tax on real estate values of banking offices consolidated in conjunction with the ashland banking acquisition and an other than temporary impairment charge of  or  after tax on an investment in fannie mae fnma preferred stock 
the aggregate impact of these transactions resulted in a charge to income of  or  after tax in comparatively  peoples recorded a net charge of  or  after tax in relating to the investment portfolio restructuring and long term debt restructuring 
net interest income totaled million in and net interest margin was compared to million and in both net interest income and margin were negatively impacted by very competitive pricing for loans and deposits  as well as peoples management of its interest rate risk position  which included extending the maturities of funding liabilities resulted in increased interest expense 
in  peoples non interest revenues benefited from acquisitions  especially the insurance agency acquisitions 
other income grew to million in  from million last year  due largely to increased insurance and investment commissions of million and deposit account service charges of million 
net losses on securities transactions reduced other income by million and million in and  respectively  while other income in also benefited from a million gain from the sale of peoples credit card portfolio 
deposit account service charges grew in due to higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient funds fees and an increase in the number of checking accounts  as well as an increase in the per item amount of certain cost recovery fees 
in  insurance and investment commissions totaled million compared to million the previous year  reflecting the revenues generated by the acquired insurance agencies 
e banking revenues remained strong in  growing to million  due to additional debit cards issued to customers and higher volumes of transactions completed using peoples debit cards 
other expense totaled million in versus the previous year  an increase of million 
salaries and benefits were up million in  with over half of this increase attributable to the insurance agency acquisitions and full year s impact of the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
net occupancy and equipment costs totaled million in versus million  while intangible amortization was million in versus million in both increases reflect additional costs associated with acquisitions completed in and bankcard costs increased in  largely the result of peoples increased customer base and additional cards issued  coupled with increased customer activity 
these expense increases were offset by the decline in expense that occurred as a result of the federal home loan bank advance prepayment fees of million incurred in late as the long term debt restructuring
