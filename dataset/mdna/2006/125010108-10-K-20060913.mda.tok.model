item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a global provider of integrated network solutions that include access and transport equipment  content and operations management systems and technical services for broadband networks 
the company operates in three business segments c cor access and transport  c cor solutions and c cor network services 
our c cor access and transport segment is responsible for the development  management  production  support and sale of network infrastructure products  including our amplitude modulation headend hub optical platform and line of optical nodes  and a full offering of radio frequency amplifiers and high quality  high capacity transport platforms for multiservice  packet based networks 
our c cor solutions segment is responsible for development  integration  management  implementation  support  and sale of content and operations management systems  including software and hardware  for delivery of video on demand and digital advertising as well as application oriented software for network and service assurance  workforce management and policy service management 
our c cor network services segment provides technical services for engineering  design  and deployment of advanced applications over broadband networks  including outsourced operational services  network design and engineering  network integration  outside plant and construction services  and consulting to a variety of customers 

table of contents net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million in fiscal year  reflecting higher revenues from the sales of content and operations management systems and network technical services 
content and operations management systems revenues increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher video on demand vod sales and back office operational support system sales 
technical services revenues increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  due to increased recurring services projects and upgrade work 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues for access and transport products  primarily in international markets 
our largest customer during fiscal year was time warner cable  accounting for of net sales 
our financial results for fiscal year  ended june   include one additional week of operations compared to fiscal year gross margins were compared to gross margins of for fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded an million write down in inventory due to our decision to cease selling certain transport product lines 
during fiscal year  we implemented a company wide restructuring plan  which involved expense reductions  product line rationalization  and divestitures of certain operations see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we believe that our restructuring activity is substantially complete  but we will continue to monitor our business and may determine that it is appropriate to further implement restructuring initiatives in the future 
our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were for both fiscal years and operating expense levels for both selling and administrative expense and research and product development expense  increased during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year this resulted from higher personnel and administrative expense from the acquisition of ncube corporation ncube in fiscal year and increased expense due to recording million of stock based compensation associated with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

we are subject to various risks associated with our business operations 
for additional information concerning risks  refer to risk factors  in part  item a of this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accounting and financial reporting policies of the company are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management has discussed the development and selection of the company s critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s related disclosures 
a detailed description of the company s significant accounting policies is set forth below and in the notes to consolidated financial statements in the company s form k for fiscal year the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets  and long lived assets 
table of contents restructuring costs share based compensation warranty liabilities accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions accounting for income taxes different assumptions and judgments would change estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales and sales type leases is recognized based upon delivery terms 
revenue is recognized when the equipment has been shipped to the customer if delivery terms are origin based fob shipping point and ex works 
when delivery terms are destination based fob destination  delivery duty unpaid ddu and delivery duty paid ddp  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the equipment 
when payments are received upon product delivery and the agreement with the customer contains a customer acceptance clause  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained 
service revenues  consisting of system design  field services  and other consulting engagements  are generally recognized as services are rendered in accordance with the terms of contracts 
we also enter into multiple element contracts that entail delivery of both products and services 
revenue from these contracts is accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  for certain contracts we have recorded revenue by reference to the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs remaining to fulfill the contracts 
for other contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and costs based on the units of delivery method 
this method recognizes as revenue the contract price of units of the product delivered during each period and the costs allocable to the delivered units as the cost of earned revenue 
provisions for losses on service contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we typically perform the services prior to billing the customer which gives rise to unbilled receivables 
in these circumstances  billings usually occur shortly after we perform a specified amount of the work  as outlined in the contract 
unbilled receivables are expected to be billed and collected generally within three to six months 
content and operations management systems revenues consist of equipment and application oriented software to support the sale of video on demand systems  digital advertising insertion systems  and operational support systems 
for our software licensing arrangements involving multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair values of the elements 
our vsoe of fair value is determined based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  revenue is deferred until all elements without vsoe are delivered at which time we apply the residual method 
under the residual method  if vsoe exists for the undelivered elements  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and recognized ratably  and the remaining portion of the arrangement is recognized as revenue upon delivery  which generally occurs on completion of implementation of the system 
license revenue allocated to software products  in certain circumstances  is recognized upon the delivery of the software products 
for certain of our software license arrangements where professional services are being provided that are deemed to be essential to the functionality or are for significant production  modification  or customization of the software product  both the software product revenue and the professional service revenue are recognized on the completed contract method  as the company does not have the ability to reasonably estimate contract costs at the inception of the contracts 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized when the contract is complete  and all direct costs and related revenues are deferred until that time 
beginning in fiscal year  we recognize software license and associated professional services revenue for one of our software license products mobile workforce 
table of contents management using the percentage of completion method of accounting as we believe that our estimates of costs to complete and extent of progress toward completion of such contracts are reliable 
software maintenance and support service fees are generally billed and collected in advance of the associated maintenance contract term and are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably under the straight line method over the term of the contract 
the entire amount of an estimated loss on a contract is accrued at the time a loss on a contract is projected 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we establish a general allowance for doubtful accounts based on percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors  including current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
in addition  we establish allowances for specifically identified doubtful accounts when a loss is deemed to be both probable and estimable 
in the event that we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an unexpected problem with collectibility of receivables and our actual bad debts differ from estimates  or we adjust estimates in future periods  our established allowances may be insufficient and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if we provided more allowances than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on our actual collection experience 
in the event we adjust our allowance estimates  it could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated primarily at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we establish provisions for excess and obsolete inventories after evaluation of historical sales and usage  current economic trends  market conditions  product rationalization  forecasted sales  product lifecycles  and current inventory levels 
this evaluation requires us to make estimates regarding future events in an industry where rapid technological changes are prevalent 
it is possible that increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a decline in market conditions or if changes in expected product lifecycles occur 
alternatively  if market conditions improve or product lifecycles extend  we may have greater success in selling inventory that had previously been written down 
in either event  the actual value of our inventory may be higher or lower and recognition of such difference will affect our cost of sales in a future period  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position 
valuation of goodwill  other intangible assets  and other long lived assets 
we assess goodwill at least annually for impairment and more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we have chosen the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year as the period for performing our annual assessment 
the impairment assessment is performed in two steps i we determine whether impairment is indicated by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value and ii if there is an indication of impairment  we measure the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we normally calculate the fair value of our reporting units by using the projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determine to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
if impairment is indicated  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities 
the residual value is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
we also assess other intangible assets and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
when an impairment of goodwill  intangible assets  or long lived assets is determined  it is recorded as a charge against earnings in the period when recognized 
for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
statement requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred 
statement requires us to make judgments in estimating the restructuring costs of leased facilities  including such 
table of contents assumptions as to when a facility will be subleased and the amount of sublease income 
for additional information regarding restructuring costs  refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
revisions to our estimates could result in an additional charge to earnings or a reversal of previously recorded charges  which could materially affect our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions change 
share based compensation 
the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment statement r as of june   which requires the company to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results differ from the company s estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
the company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
warranty liabilities 
we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship  generally for one to five years  depending upon product lines and geographic regions 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is recorded when the product is shipped  based upon our historical experience of known product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
in addition  from time to time  the recorded amount is adjusted for specifically identified warranty exposures if unforeseen technical problems arise 
in the event that our historical experience of product failure rates and costs of correcting product failures change  or our estimates relating to probable losses resulting from specifically identified warranty exposures change  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provided more reserves than we needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
in the event we change our warranty reserve estimates  the resulting charge against future cost of sales or reversal of previously recorded charges may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  are either included within the consolidated statement of operations or as a separate component of shareholders equity 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based upon management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billing  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but dependency upon the parent company and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements is included in shareholders equity 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of the subsidiary s financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
we convert the assets and liabilities of foreign operations into their united states dollar equivalents at rates in effect at the balance sheet dates 
the statements of operations of foreign operations are translated from the operation s functional currency to the united states dollar equivalents at average rates for the period 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from settlement of foreign receivables and payables  including certain cross currency intercompany activities where payment is expected to be satisfied in the normal course of business  are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
other cross currency intercompany activities  where management has no intent to require payment in the foreseeable future  are recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in the event management s intent with respect to 
table of contents cross currency intercompany activities changes  such changes could result in future foreign currency gains or losses that may materially affect our operating results and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our actual current income tax payable and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as reserves and accruals  for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred taxes arise due to temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities and from net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in the company s consolidated statement of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
overview of divestitures and impairment charges during fiscal year  we recognized total impairment charges of million 
an impairment loss of million was recognized during the second quarter of fiscal year related to our decision to cease sales and marketing activities associated with certain transport product lines 
the impairment charge was comprised of million of other intangible assets associated with purchased technology and  associated with the write down of property and equipment 
the fair value of these assets was measured based on an estimate of discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of these assets 
on april   we divested our operation located in mulgrave  australia  in a sale of business transaction 
the operation was included as part of our access and transport segment 
the terms of sale included a million australian dollar cash payment million united states dollars for the business 
we recorded an impairment of million associated with a write down in our investment in the business during fiscal year on march   we divested our digital video product line  which was deemed to be a non strategic product line  in a sale to newfound technologies corporation  a privately held  massachusetts based supplier of electronic hardware 
the sale included the company s dv series of products  which was included in our access and transport product segment 
the terms of sale included a million cash payment  which was made up of an initial payment of million and an installment receivable of  to be paid in three quarterly installments of  each  payable   and days from the closing date of march  the first installment payment was received as of june  additional contingent cash consideration will be paid to us if certain sales objectives are achieved in the twenty five months immediately following march  the sale included the transfer of assets  primarily inventory and fixed assets and certain liabilities

fiscal year ended in millions of dollars geographic region june  net sales change from prior year june  net sales change from prior year june  net sales united states europe asia canada latin america consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
sales on a consolidated basis increased in fiscal year  reflecting higher revenues from the sales of content and operations management  including product lines acquired from ncube  which is included in our results for the full year of fiscal and for approximately six months during fiscal year  and higher technical service sales 
these higher revenues were partially offset by lower sales for access and transport products 
our largest customer for fiscal year was time warner cable  accounting for of net sales 
c cor access and transport segment sales decreased during fiscal year  which was attributable primarily to a decline in sales to international customers in europe  asia  and latin america 
we believe capital spending in international regions was constrained due to spending cycles  competition  and consolidation among communication providers 
sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year c cor solutions segment sales increased during fiscal year reflecting sales of our content and operations management systems 
the increase for fiscal year resulted primarily from increased sales of systems and software applications for video on demand vod products  derived from product lines acquired in our acquisition of ncube in the third quarter of fiscal year in addition  sales of operational support software oss  primarily for mobile workforce management and subscriber fulfillment solutions  increased as network operators seek to improve the management of their service delivery and add new services to increase revenue 
the majority of revenues in this segment are derived from sales under multiple element arrangements  whereby revenues are recognized using the completed contract method of accounting or  in some cases  are recognized ratably over the delivery period 
as a result  revenues in the c cor solutions segment are affected 
table of contents both by the timing of new orders and customer acceptance requirements 
software license and associated professional services revenue for our mobile workforce software product line is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting due to our ability to reliably estimate contract costs at the inception of the contracts 
c cor network services segment sales increased during fiscal year resulting from increased recurring services projects with time warner cable and upgrade projects with mediacom communications 
the increases were partially offset by lower sales to adelphia related to upgrade projects which had accounted for a substantial portion of revenues in fiscal year domestic sales increased for c cor solutions and c cor network services segments during fiscal year  due to increased revenues for content and operations managements systems  primarily for vod and certain oss product lines  and recurring services 
domestic sales of c cor access and transport product lines were relatively flat during fiscal year international sales decreased for fiscal year due primarily to lower c cor access and transport sales in europe  asia  and latin america  which were partially offset by increased revenues for our vod products in the c cor solutions segment 
we expect demand for our product line offerings in international markets will continue to be highly variable 
the international markets represent distinct markets in which capital spending decisions for network equipment and solutions are affected by a variety of factors  including access to financing and general economic conditions 
the tables below sets forth our backlog by industry segment as of june  compared to june  fiscal year ended june  in millions of dollars industry segment c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions total backlog of total month backlog greater than month backlog total backlog of total fiscal year ended june  in millions of dollars industry segment c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions total backlog of total month backlog total backlog of total as of june   we began reporting total contract backlog  which is defined as the revenue we expect to generate in future periods from existing customer contracts 
our month backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate from customer contracts over the next months 
as of june   the majority of orders in backlog for c cor access and transport will result in revenue over the next six months while orders in backlog of c cor network services typically include a portion that will result in revenue over the latter part of the twelve month period 
for c cor solutions  included in backlog are software license fees  maintenance fees  systems and services specified in executed contracts  for which the timing of revenue can be affected by both contract performance and the application of accounting principles to the specific terms of the contract 
as a result  a portion of our c cor solutions backlog is expected to generate revenues in periods that extend beyond 
table of contents the next months 
our backlog as of june  represented our estimate of backlog that was expected to be realized over a month period and did not reflect total contract backlog 
our backlog methodology requires us to make judgments about the timing of implementation and deployment schedules based upon our historical experience 
backlog can change due to a number of factors  including unforeseen changes in development and implementation schedules  contract renegotiations or terminations  or changes in customer financial conditions 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the amount of revenue actually recognized in future periods 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that contracts included in backlog will actually generate the anticipated revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated as indicated for the corresponding month or greater than month periods 
we make management decisions based on our backlog  including hiring of personnel  purchasing of materials  and other matters that may increase our production capabilities and costs 
cancellations  delays or reductions of orders or contracts could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
gross margin 
the following table sets forth our gross margins by operating segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year fiscal year ended operating segment june  gross margin change points june  gross margin c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions consolidated consolidated gross margins decreased during fiscal year  primarily due to lower gross margin in our c cor access and transport segment 
c cor access and transport segment gross margins decreased due to an million write down in inventory during fiscal year associated with certain transport product lines  based on management s assessment of market conditions for those products 
in addition  lower volumes and product mix also contributed to the decline in gross margins 
c cor network services segment gross margins increased during fiscal year due to higher margins on recurring services revenues 
higher project costs and adjustments associated with the adelphia upgrade projects in fiscal year contributed to lower margins during the prior year period 
gross margins increased for the c cor solutions segment during fiscal year due primarily to the higher volumes and product mix 
we anticipate that our future gross margins in all of our business segments will continue to be affected by many factors  including revenue levels in general  sales mix  competitive pricing pressures  the timing of new product introductions and the timing of deployments for certain of our content and operations management systems 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased during fiscal year as a result of higher personnel and administrative expense associated with the acquisition of ncube  which were included in operating expenses for a full year during fiscal year compared to approximately six months during fiscal year  and stock based compensation associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment statement r  effective as of june  research and product development

research and product development expenses in the c cor solutions segment increased for fiscal year  primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from the acquisition of ncube  which were included in operating expenses for a full year during fiscal year compared to approximately six months during fiscal year we believe sustained commitment to product development efforts will be required for us to remain competitive  and anticipate continuing investments in research and product development in future periods related to access and transport products  on demand systems  and operational support software solutions 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million in fiscal year compared to restructuring charges of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring of our operations to reduce costs and maximize operational efficiency by relocating certain processes from wallingford  connecticut to our tijuana  mexico facility as well as closing our sunnyvale  california and andover  massachusetts facilities 
the restructuring charges represented employee termination benefits associated with workforce reductions of approximately employees and lease commitment costs related to the closure and downsizing of these facilities 
the restructuring initiative was substantially completed as of june  operating income loss by segment

fiscal year ended in millions of dollars june  operating income loss change from prior year june  operating income loss operating segment c cor access and transport c cor network services c cor solutions operating income excluding unallocated items for the c cor access and transport segment decreased for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year due to lower revenues and gross margins  which included an million write down of inventory associated with certain transport product lines  as well as restructuring costs incurred during the period 
operating income excluding unallocated items for the c cor network services segment increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to increased gross margin associated with recurring services 
in addition  operating results for c cor network services were adversely affected by higher project costs incurred on certain upgrade projects in fiscal year operating loss excluding unallocated items for the c cor solutions segment decreased for fiscal year  compared to the prior year 
although revenues increased in this segment during fiscal year  an operating loss was incurred 
table of contents as result of higher operating expenses  including higher amortization of intangibles associated with the ncube acquisition and restructuring costs 
interest expense and investment income 
interest expense was million in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from interest payments and debt issuance costs associated with our senior unsecured convertible notes issued on december  in the acquisition of ncube 
investment income was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year investment income increased in fiscal year  due to  of interest income received on proceeds from the sale of trade claims in the bankruptcy cases of adelphia and affiliates  and higher investment returns compared to fiscal year gain on sale of bankruptcy trade claims 
in october  we sold substantially all of our pre petition claims related to accounts receivables in the bankruptcy cases of adelphia and affiliates 
we received an initial payment in fiscal year of million  with additional amounts being held in escrow pending the resolution of certain contingencies 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we received million includes interest income of  of the additional funds held in escrow 
a gain of million net of  credited to interest income and legal costs was recorded as a gain on sale of bankruptcy trade claims in the fourth quarter of fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income was million in fiscal year compared to other expense of  in fiscal year included in other income for fiscal year was a million gain on litigation judgment and million gain on sale of assets 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million for fiscal year compared with an income tax benefit for fiscal year of  income taxes for fiscal year included the effect of changes in valuation allowances  deferred tax adjustments and current taxes paid or payable in certain foreign jurisdictions where the company had taxable income 
the income tax benefit in fiscal year included the reversal of approximately million in certain tax contingencies settled during the year which was offset by current taxes payable for state and foreign income taxes in certain jurisdictions where we were profitable 
the company has assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets  giving consideration to historical operating losses  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
we have concluded as of june   the realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences  net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is uncertain in many of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
therefore  we have continued to maintain a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets  with the exception of deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions where the company is profitable 
we expect to maintain valuation allowances related to deferred tax benefits until a level of profitability is achieved and sustained in the applicable tax jurisdiction that demonstrates it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax assets 
in the event that we reverse the valuation allowance in the future  reported tax expense subsequent to such action will increase and will likely approximate the statutory rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
sales on a consolidated basis declined in fiscal year resulting from lower product and technical service sales  which were partially offset by a increase in sales for digital advertising insertion systems and operational support software solutions  which included product lines acquired from ncube 
our largest customers for fiscal year were time warner cable and adelphia  accounting for and  respectively  of net sales 

table of contents c cor access and transport segment sales decreased during fiscal year  which was attributable to lower product sales to certain domestic cable operators  including adelphia  comcast and cox  as well as customers in the asia pacific region 
the decline was partially offset by increased sales in europe  as we benefited from increased capital spending in spain and the united kingdom 
sales of radio frequency amplifiers decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year optical product sales declined  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year c cor network services segment sales decreased during fiscal year resulting from lower revenues related to network upgrade and build out activities  which were partially offset by increased recurring service revenues which include system maintenance  customer service call and installation activities 
c cor solutions segment sales increased for fiscal year  reflecting sales of our operational support software solutions  as well as sales deriving from the acquisition of ncube 
the ncube acquisition contributed approximately million in sales during the last half of fiscal year domestic sales of c cor access and transport and c cor network services segments declined during fiscal year  due to lower spending for both products and technical services by certain cable operators 
these decreases were partially offset by increased domestic sales for our c cor solutions segment  due to product lines acquired from ncube 
international sales increased for c cor access and transport and c cor solutions segments during fiscal year increased sales in europe and latin america were partially offset by lower sales in the asia pacific region

for the c cor access and transport segment  gross margins increased due to product mix changes and million of lower warranty costs resulting from settlement of previously recorded specific warranty liabilities for amounts below their recorded value 
for the c cor network services segment  gross margins declined due to higher project costs associated with upgrade projects and lower sales volume 
for the c cor solutions segment  gross margins for the year declined as a result of product mix  as product lines acquired from ncube had lower margins than our other operational support software solutions products 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses were million of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million of net sales in fiscal year selling and administrative expenses increased during the period as a result of increases in personnel and administrative expense due to the lantern communications  inc lantern and alopa networks  inc alopa acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the stargus inc stargus  optinel systems  inc optinel  and ncube acquisitions completed during fiscal year additional increases in costs were incurred during the year associated with marketing and promotional expenses and accounting and consulting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of

in addition  future amounts are owed to third parties related to a portion of the proceeds we received from a litigation judgment in amounts that were undetermined as of june  taking into account the fixed charges associated with our long term debt obligations  amounts owed to third parties from proceeds received from the litigation judgment and restructuring accruals  we believe remaining cash and cash equivalents balances  and our marketable securities will be adequate to cover our operating cash requirements over the next to months 
however  we may find it necessary or desirable to seek financing to support our capital needs and provide funds for additional strategic initiatives  including acquiring or investing in complementary business  products  services  or technologies 
accordingly  this may require third party financing or equity based financing  such as issuance of common stock  preferred stock  or subordinated convertible debt securities and warrants  which would be dilutive to existing shareholders 
we do not currently have any committed lines of credit or other available credit facilities that could be utilized for capital requirements  and it is uncertain whether such facilities could be obtained in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 

table of contents accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in sfas no 
r  share based payment  or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp 
an entity that adopts sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application may make a one time election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp 
an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 
r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election 
we are currently evaluating the impact this fsp will have on our consolidated financial statements  and as such we have not elected to adopt the transition method as of june  this method is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition and the second is measurement 
for recognition  an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date of fin may be recognized or  continue to be recognized  upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
fin will apply to fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact fin will have on our consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal year and are unable  at this time  to quantify the impact  if any  to retained earnings at the time of adoption
