overview gander mountain company operates the nation s largest retail network of stores specializing in hunting  fishing  camping  marine and outdoor lifestyle products and services 
we have expanded our store base from stores in to our current base of conveniently located gander mountain outdoor lifestyle stores  providing five million square feet of retail space in eighteen states arkansas  colorado  illinois  indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky  maryland  michigan  minnesota  new york  north carolina  north dakota  ohio  pennsylvania  texas  virginia and wisconsin 
we anticipate opening six to eight new stores in  including two relocations 
our core strategy and focus is to provide our target customers with a unique combination of a broad assortment of outdoor equipment  accessories  related technical apparel and footwear  expert services  convenient locations and value pricing 
our stores feature an extensive selection of leading national and regional brands as well as our company s owned brands 
we tailor our merchandise assortments to take advantage of our customers seasonal and regional or local preferences 
we seek to combine this broad product offering with superior customer service based on our store associates extensive product knowledge and outdoor related experience 
since its origin in  our brand name has had a heritage of strong appeal and relevance to consumers who participate in outdoor sports and recreation activities  based on our we live outdoors culture and theme 
from to  our predecessor operated a nationwide catalog business that  by  included retail stores 
in and  holiday companies  which at the time owned and operated a group of retail sporting goods stores  acquired these gander mountain retail stores  formed our company and began to build a new outdoor lifestyle business 
in march  we began transforming our market position from a traditional specialty store to a large format  category focused store by opening new stores in a large format and increasing the selling space within our original  small format stores 
prior to march  our typical store was approximately  square feet 
our large format stores range from approximately  to  square feet  with our current focus primarily upon stores of  to  square feet with an outside selling area 
our stores are located with convenient access to a major highway 
they have a warehouse style shopping environment characterized by concrete floors  open bar joist ceilings  high density racking and wide aisles  which reinforces our overall value proposition to our customers and enables us to substantially increase the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings 
most of our large format stores offer atvs  and some carry an expanded assortment of fishing and recreational boats 
our large format stores offer unique features and specialized services  including a full service gunsmith shop  a full service archery pro shop  archery target lanes  and a power shop performing repairs for atvs  boats and other small engines 
some of the large format stores also include a bait shop that opens early for the convenience of our customers 
nearly all of our stores have a gander mountain lodge  which is an in store meeting room available for public use  where we provide hunter safety classes  outdoor skills seminars and other community focused activities 
we utilize outside selling areas adjacent to some of our large format stores to display additional offerings of larger items such as atvs  boats  kayaks  trailers and canoes 
as of january   of our stores were in our large format 
we are utilizing several strategic and operating initiatives aimed at improving our merchandise offerings  enhancing profitability and expanding the number and geographic diversity of our stores 
we measure performance using key operating statistics such as comparable store sales  sales per square foot  gross margin percentage and store operating expenses  with a focus on labor  as a percentage of sales 
we also measure and evaluate investments in our retail locations  including inventory and property and equipment 
inventory performance is primarily measured by inventory per square foot and by inventory turns  or the number of times store inventory turns over in a given period  and amounts of owned inventory at various times based on payment terms from our vendors 
the most significant investments in property and equipment are made at the time a store is opened by us 
we believe that the overall growth of our business will allow us to generally maintain or increase our product gross margins 
increased merchandise volumes should enable us to improve our purchasing leverage and achieve greater support throughout the supply chain 
the mix of merchandise in our total sales also influences our product gross margins 
as we continue sales and store growth  a number of other factors may impact  positively or negatively  our product gross margin percentage  including the introduction of new product categories with varying gross margin percentage characteristics  changes in the merchandise mix at our current locations  differences in merchandise mix by geographic location  price competition  clearance activities in connection with seasonal inventory management  closeout sales in connection with store relocations and consolidations  sourcing of products from locations outside the united states  vendor programs  and supply chain enhancements 
in addition  the company s gross margin is impacted by store occupancy and distribution costs 
we monitor these costs in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the most significant store operating expenses are labor and related employee benefits and advertising 
we believe improved labor management within our stores will allow us to better leverage payroll expenses over time 
our employee benefits include health insurance  the cost of which continues to increase faster than the general rate of inflation 
we continually monitor this cost and review strategies to effectively control increases  but we are subject to the overall trend of increases in health care costs 
advertising costs are monitored as a percentage of sales 
these costs are largely variable  which allows us to actively manage them to facilitate achieving our sales  gross margin percentage and store operating contribution objectives 
store operating contribution  which is calculated by deducting a store s operating expenses from its gross margin  is used to evaluate overall performance on an individual store basis 
general and administrative expenses are monitored and controlled as a percentage of sales 
we have made significant investments in infrastructure  including our information systems  distribution capabilities and personnel 
our current infrastructure facilitates our planned opening of stores  which we believe enables us to leverage our expenses 
accordingly  we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales over time 
pre opening expenses will continue to be related to store openings  including relocations 
these expenses will fluctuate based on the number and timing of new store openings 
inventory turns are based on cost of sales and average inventory for the applicable period 
we recognize that our inventory turns may be lower than those of other retailers  which we believe is due  in part  to the categories of merchandise we carry  including firearms  and the large quantities of merchandise we use in our in store displays 
we believe we have the opportunity to enhance our supply chain to improve our inventory turns 
additionally  in merchandise categories that experience slower inventory turns  we continue to work with vendors to increase our trade credit terms to reduce our investment in owned inventory 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve our inventory turns or inventory investment 
identification of appropriate new store sites is essential to our growth strategy 
we believe our focus on our larger store size and our ability to utilize either recycled  or second use  facilities or build to suit locations provides us with increased opportunities to find optimal real estate locations on attractive terms 
we evaluate and invest in new stores based on site specific projected returns on investment 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  selected items in the statements of operations as a percentage of our sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses store operating expenses general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss sales consist of sales from comparable stores  new stores and non comparable stores 
a store is included in the comparable store base in its fifteenth full month of operations 
a relocated store returns to the comparable store base in its fifteenth full month after relocation 
new store sales include sales from stores we opened during the current period 
non comparable store sales include sales in the current period from our stores opened during the previous fiscal year before they have begun their fifteenth month of operation 
during the quarter ended july   we changed this internal measurement from the fourteenth month to the fifteenth month to better reflect comparable sales activity in the stores and minimize the effect of grand opening activities 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise  freight  distribution  inventory shrinkage and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges 
store operating expenses include store associate payroll  taxes and fringe benefits  advertising  maintenance  utilities  depreciation  insurance  bank and credit card charges and other store level expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all expenses associated with operating our corporate headquarters 
pre opening expenses consist primarily of payroll  rent  recruiting  advertising and other costs incurred prior to a new store opening 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from sales of million from fiscal and new stores not yet included in the comparable store sales base  offset by a comparable store sales decrease of million  or  and a million sales decrease from closed stores and changes in other revenue 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  including two relocated stores  and added million square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
comparable store sales decreased for fiscal as we experienced reduced sales across all but one of our product categories 
overall  we believe sales performance in fiscal year was negatively impacted by  among other factors  cannibalization from some of the new store openings and new competition entering certain of our markets 
in addition  sales in the second half of fiscal were impacted by the weather  directly  from unseasonable weather patterns in certain of our operating markets  and  indirectly  from the impact of three devastating hurricanes and the resulting downturn in consumer confidence  much of which we believe was driven by higher energy prices 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal  except for the power sports category  which increased its share of the sales mix  driven largely by atv sales at new large format stores and sales of atv accessories 
our firearms business continues to gain market share  reflecting consistent gains as a percentage of the sales mix 
the apparel footwear category experienced a slight decline in its share of the sales mix  primarily driven by weather factors 
marine accessories sales produced a positive comparable store sales result for the year and an increase in the overall sales mix as a result of the expansion of the marine products offering and our increased focus on that market 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal major factors primarily affecting gross margin during fiscal year were an initial product margin increase of approximately basis points  a negative impact of approximately basis points resulting from the absence of a co branded credit card program for a significant part of fiscal as well as different terms under the new card provider  aggressive seasonal clearance sales of merchandise in the second and third quarters of fiscal negatively impacting gross margin by approximately basis points  changes in our product mix  primarily increased sales penetration of lower margin categories such as firearms and atvs and less penetration of higher margin apparel and footwear  accounted for a decrease of approximately basis points  a negative impact of approximately basis points from increased store occupancy costs as a result of reduced leverage from lower comparable store sales and lower sales per square foot at our newer  less mature stores  and a negative impact of approximately basis points from higher distribution costs as a result of higher fuel costs and inefficiencies at our distribution center 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  store operating expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal net advertising expense decreased basis points due to more focused advertising that resulted in less spending  offset by the effect of reduced leverage in labor costs and depreciation primarily due to the comparable store sales decline and lower sales in less mature stores 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a basis point gain from the settlement of our contract with the previous provider of our co branded credit card that resulted in a payment to us of million  offset by increased expenses due to reduced leverage from the comparable stores sales decline and increased legal fees 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened new stores in each of fiscal and fiscal  including two relocated stores in each year 
the reduced pre opening expenses on a per store basis are due to improved efficiencies in store opening processes and cost control 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average net borrowings used to fund our growth during fiscal  including the placement of million in convertible debt in august average interest rates on our credit facility were basis points higher in fiscal than in fiscal our average interest rate in effect at january  and january  was and  respectively 
income tax provision 
we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal or  due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net loss 
our net loss was million for fiscal  as compared to net income of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from sales of million from fiscal and new stores not yet included in the comparable store sales base  offset by a comparable store sales decrease of million  or  and a million sales decrease from closed stores and changes in other revenue 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  including two relocated stores  and added million square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
overall  sales performance throughout the year was impacted by unfavorable weather conditions  which particularly affected our apparel footwear  fishing marine and camping categories 
the most significant impact on our business was in the third and fourth quarters  which were negatively impacted by long periods of unseasonably warm weather in our primary regions 
in addition  for certain of our stores  sales were also negatively impacted by cannibalization from some of the new gander mountain store openings as well as new competition entering our markets 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal  except for the atv category  which increased its share of the sales mix  driven by sales at new  large format stores 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to a basis point increase from vendor co op funds  which in prior years were reflected as reductions in advertising expense because proof of performance for advertising programs had been required prior to fiscal gross profit also includes million  or basis points  of unredeemed gift cards recorded as revenue in fiscal  versus only million recorded as revenue in fiscal while improvements in most product categories resulted in a basis point increase in product margins  reduced leverage in store occupancy costs offset the improvement 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  store operating expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal net advertising expense increased basis points due primarily to the change in vendor co op funds discussed previously 
in fiscal  vendor co op funds were reflected as a reduction in inventory and cost of sales versus as a reduction in advertising expense in fiscal store payroll costs as a percentage of sales improved basis points in fiscal due to improved labor management and reduced performance bonus payouts 
these gains were partially offset by the fiscal impact of a change in our vacation policy 
depreciation expense as a percentage of sales increased basis points due to sales de leverage 
additionally  in fiscal  we incurred million in charges relating to the removal of waterfall displays from smaller format stores and the relocation of two stores 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the basis point impact of no performance bonus payouts for fiscal was partially offset by the fiscal change in our vacation policy 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened new stores in fiscal  including two relocated stores  and we opened ten new stores in fiscal  including two relocated stores 
pre opening rent expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average net borrowings used to fund our growth during fiscal average interest rates on our credit facility were basis points higher in fiscal than in fiscal income tax provision 
we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal or  due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net income 
our net income of million for fiscal increased by million from our net income of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
preferred stock dividend 
we continued to reflect the accretion of cumulative unpaid dividends on our previously outstanding class a  b and c convertible preferred stock in accordance with accounting standards until the closing of our initial public offering 
no such dividends were paid  and any unpaid cumulative dividends were extinguished with the changes in capital structure associated with the closing of our initial public offering 
no such obligation or reduction to net income is reflected in our results of operations after may  quarterly results of operations and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new store openings and related expenses  profitability of new stores  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuation  with the highest sales activity normally occurring during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  which are primarily associated with the fall hunting seasons and the holiday season 
in recent years  the second half of our fiscal years represented approximately to of our annual sales  including new store sales 
in addition  our customers demand for our products and therefore our sales  can be significantly impacted by unseasonable weather conditions that affect outdoor activities and the demand for related apparel and equipment 
this seasonality also impacts our inventory levels  which tend to rise beginning approximately in april  reach a peak in november  and decline to lower levels after the december holiday season 
our pre opening expenses have and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  primarily due to the timing of store openings 
we typically incur most pre opening expenses for a new store during the three months preceding  and the month of  its opening 
in addition  our labor and operating costs for a newly opened store can be greater during the first one to two months of operation than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new store openings in any quarter has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs and store labor and operating expenses 
due to these factors  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year 
see note to our financial statements included in this report for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses to support our new store growth plans and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses 
until the completion of our initial public offering  our main sources of liquidity were equity investments by  and advances from  holiday companies and its affiliated entities  and borrowings under our credit facility 
the following chart summarizes the principal elements of our cash flow for the past three fiscal years and the number of stores opened during the period 
cash flow summary fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities total net increase in cash details of financing activities borrowings under credit facility proceeds from issuance of convertible notes proceeds from exercise of stock options and espp proceeds from sale of common stock  net of expenses proceeds repayments from holiday companies equity investments and advances  net store openings  including relocated stores net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million of net cash used in operating activities in fiscal and million of net cash used in operating activities in fiscal there were new stores opened in both fiscal and requiring the use of operating capital to fund inventories 
the overall million decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal partially reflects the lower levels of inventories in our recently opened stores as well as the success of our efforts to reduce inventory in all of our stores 
the reduced use of cash resulting from the inventory reduction on a per store basis was partially offset by less funding through accounts payable balances  due in part to increased sourcing of foreign products 
the million increase in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal  reflects primarily the increased inventory levels to support the new stores opened in fiscal versus in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities consists entirely of purchases of property and equipment 
we use cash for leasehold improvements and equipment to open new and relocated stores and to remodel and upgrade existing stores 
we opened  and new stores in fiscal  and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment also includes purchases of information technology systems and expenditures for our distribution facility and our corporate headquarters 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the financing activities during these periods were primarily related to financing the increased inventory levels and property and equipment purchases for store openings and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses primarily incurred in the first six to eight months of our fiscal years 
on august   we also completed a private offering of million of convertible notes 
the proceeds were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
this financing was obtained to maintain the liquidity and flexibility necessary to open new stores and continue our strategic initiatives 
this transaction is more fully described below 
on april   we closed the initial public offering of our common stock  selling  shares of common stock  including the underwriters over allotment  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
transaction costs were million and have been reflected as a reduction of paid in capital 
the proceeds were used to eliminate our outstanding note payable to holiday companies in the amount of million and reduce million of outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility 
during fiscal  we purchased property and equipment totaling million financed through capital lease transactions 
for one particular store location  we entered into a lease containing a bargain purchase option that is exercisable upon the cancellation of a note obligation by the economic development authority in the region 
we capitalized this lease obligation  resulting in the recording of building and equipment of million with a corresponding lease obligation of million 
these capital purchases  along with million in equipment financed through other capital lease transactions in fiscal  are excluded from the caption purchase of property and equipment in our statements of cash flows for fiscal placement of subordinated unsecured convertible notes on august   we completed a private offering of million of subordinated unsecured convertible notes in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are held by a trust  the current beneficiary of which is a member of our board of directors 
the director was first elected to serve on the board of directors on the date of the closing of the transaction 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at any time by the holder at an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion price has no reset feature and adjusts only for dividends  stock divisions or combinations  recapitalizations and similar occurrences 
the notes mature on august  and bear interest at per annum for the first two years  payable semi annually  after which the rate will float at a fixed spread of on the federal funds rate from a minimum of to a maximum of 
we may prepay the notes  without penalty  any time after august   and we have the option to require conversion of the notes if the volume weighted average closing price of our common stock reaches or exceeds for any out of consecutive trading days 
under the note purchase agreement entered into in connection with this transaction  we granted the holder certain registration rights  as described therein 
on october   the commission declared effective our registration statement on form s under the securities act of registering the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the proceeds from the notes were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
transaction costs associated with the placement were approximately  credit facility to meet our liquidity and capital needs  we entered into a credit facility with fleet retail finance in fiscal fleet retail finance was subsequently acquired by bank of america  na as amended in february  this credit facility provided for revolving loans in an aggregate amount of up to million including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
in february  we completed an amendment to our credit facility to increase our availability under the facility from to million and extend the maturity date to june in september  we exercised our option to increase the facility to million 
availability under the facility may be further increased to million  subject to certain conditions including the absence of default 
other substantive terms of the facility were not materially changed by the february amendment or the september increase 
in november  we amended our credit facility to adjust the level of ebitda and operating cash flow covenants  as defined in the credit agreement 
the testing of the ebitda covenant is required when our availability under the facility is less than of the facility on any given day 
the november amendment also specifies quarterly  rather than annual testing of the operating cash flow covenant beginning on january  and continuing each quarter thereafter 
the actual availability under the amended credit facility is limited to of eligible credit card receivables plus the lesser of to of eligible inventory or of the inventory s liquidation value  in each case  net of specified reserves and less any letters of credit outstanding 
interest on the outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility currently accrues at the lender s prime commercial lending rate plus to depending on our ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  or  if we elect  at the one  two  three or six month libor plus to depending on such ebitda 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our assets 
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  as of january  and january   were million and million  respectively 
our total remaining borrowing capacity under the credit facility  after subtracting letters of credit  as of january  and january   was million and million  respectively 
financial covenants under the credit facility as of january  require that operating cash flow and ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  meet certain levels as adjusted over time 
the credit facility also contains other covenants that  among other matters  restrict our ability to incur substantial other indebtedness  create certain liens  engage in certain mergers and acquisitions  sell assets  enter into certain capital leases or make junior payments  including cash dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of january  and january  on march   we amended and restated our credit facility 
the principal purpose of the amendment was to add a million term loan to the credit facility 
the amount of the term loan is not deducted in determining availability under the revolving credit facility  except to the extent that the balance of the term loan exceeds approximately to of the eligible borrowing base 
the term loan matures on june  and bears interest at either a over the higher of bank of america s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or b libor plus 
this additional financing was obtained to maintain the liquidity levels necessary to fund continued growth and seasonal cash flow needs 
income taxes net operating loss limitation 
we have determined that a change in ownership  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  occurred effective february  this change in ownership imposes a limitation on the amount of our net operating losses that we may deduct for tax purposes in any given year 
we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million expiring between and the effect of this limitation restricts our deduction for net operating losses to approximately million in fiscal and between million and million each year for four years thereafter 
we do not expect this limitation to materially impact our future tax provision for financial reporting purposes 
due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss carry forwards  we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number of new stores we open  the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year and the need to fund seasonal operating losses 
these requirements will include costs directly related to opening new stores and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure  including technology and distribution capabilities  is able to support a larger store base 
we opened new stores in each of fiscal and fiscal  including two relocated stores in each year  and our cash used in investing activities each year approximated million 
we currently plan to open six to eight stores in fiscal  including one to two relocations or consolidations and expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately to million 
however  business conditions  business strategy or other factors may cause us to adjust such plans 
additional needs for capital include funding seasonal inventory levels and seasonal losses from operations 
other future capital requirements may include an investment for an expansion into another distribution channel in addition to our retail channel 
we can provide no assurances at this time as to the timing of such an expansion  or whether such an expansion will occur 
with the placement of the subordinated unsecured convertible notes in fiscal  we have an obligation that may require funding  depending on whether the holder of the notes ultimately exercises the option to convert the debt into shares of common stock 
if conversion fails to occur  million is due to the holder in fiscal we intend to satisfy our capital requirements in fiscal with cash flows from operations  funds available under our credit facility and equipment financing leases 
however  if capital requirements for our business strategy change  or other factors change our capital requirements  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets 
there is no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
beyond fiscal  we anticipate needing additional financing to grow our business 
interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
our outstanding subordinated unsecured convertible notes carry a fixed rate of interest until august   after which the rate will float at a fixed spread of on the federal funds rate from a minimum of to a maximum of 
our floating rate indebtedness was approximately million at january  and million at january  if short term floating interest rates on our average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding for each of the respective fiscal years 
we have not contracted for any derivative financial instruments 
we have no international sales  however  we import certain items for sale in our stores 
substantially all of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended january  we cannot assure you that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments the following table contains supplemental information regarding our total contractual obligations as of january  payments due by pay period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations capital lease obligations long term debt total includes store operating leases  which generally provide for payment of direct operating costs  primarily common area costs and real estate taxes  in addition to rent 
these obligation amounts include future minimum lease payments and exclude direct operating costs 
these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into arrangements with vendors to purchase merchandise in advance of expected delivery 
because these purchase orders do not contain any termination payments or other penalties if cancelled  they are not included in this table of contractual obligations 
these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these obligations include standby and documentary letters of credit outstanding in connection with the importing of merchandise  as well as for insurance purposes 
also includes other obligations for miscellaneous goods and services acquired  related primarily to marketing and advertising obligations 
these obligations are not recorded in our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
includes the payment obligation associated with the capital lease of one of our stores  which provides for a maximum  payment quarterly for years from lease inception 
this obligation will be reduced by allowable sales tax credits as defined in the related development agreement 
we can not estimate the amounts of these future credits  and accordingly  have not reduced payment obligations by any allowable credits 
long term debt represents our million subordinated unsecured convertible notes due in june the obligation reflected in the table also includes interest at the currently fixed rate of per annum until maturity 
however  these notes carry a fixed rate of interest until august   after which the rate will become variable 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
r in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  known as sfas no 
r 
it supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
and it amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r also supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires us to record stock compensation expense as stock compensation awards vest  which is a change from our current accounting treatment under sfas no 
while the fair value method under sfas no 
r is very similar to the fair value method under sfas no 
with regard to measurement and recognition of stock based compensation  management is currently evaluating the impact of several of the key differences between the two standards on our financial statements 
for example  sfas no 
permits us to recognize forfeitures as they occur while sfas no 
r will require us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a quarterly basis 
sfas no 
r will also require a classification change in the statement of cash flows whereby a portion of the tax benefit from stock options will move from operating cash flows to financing cash flows total cash flows will remain unchanged 
estimates of option values under current pro forma disclosures using the black scholes method may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted under sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal  as required under the commission s rule announced april  we have evaluated the requirements under sfas no 
r and currently expect that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
r will have an estimated impact on pre tax income of approximately million for fiscal if we grant additional stock options during fiscal  or make other stock option modifications  this amount may materially change 
fas in october  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this clarification requires that any rental costs incurred after we take possession of a leased property  or have effective control  shall be recognized as rental expense 
currently  our policy is to capitalize such rental costs during the pre opening period 
the new guidance is effective at the beginning of fiscal our adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our net earnings  cash flows or financial position 
eitf no 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
eitf provides guidance on the amortization period for leasehold improvements in operating leases that are either acquired significantly after the beginning of the initial lease term or acquired as the result of a business combination 
this guidance requires leasehold improvements purchased after the beginning of the initial lease term to be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
this guidance was effective as of the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our net earnings  cash flows or financial position 
fin in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
our adoption of fin in the fourth quarter of fiscal did not have a material impact on our net earnings  cash flows or financial position 
sfas no 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and readers should review those policies for additional information 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
inventory valuation we maintain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reduce inventory costs for estimates of vendor allowances  as described below 
valuation reserves are established based primarily on forecasted consumer demand  inventory aging and obsolescence 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or other changes impact demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we also establish inventory shrink reserves 
we estimate a provision for these losses based on independent  periodic physical inventory counts 
we accrue for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis  based on a number of factors  including historical results 
if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation may be too high or too low at this time 
vendor allowances we receive allowances in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to volume rebates  new store purchases  cooperative advertising allowances and other purchase discounts 
amounts to be received from a vendor are estimated on a monthly basis and are recognized as a reduction of costs of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on actual and estimated volumes of merchandise purchased from these vendors 
the majority of these vendor allowances are based on specific contract terms with our vendors 
beginning in fiscal  we agreed with our vendors to eliminate proof of performance requirements on substantially all of our contracts 
accordingly  vendor monies that support our advertising programs have been recorded as a reduction in the cost of inventory  and are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future  undiscounted net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values and to determine the useful lives of the assets 
using this impairment review methodology  we recorded a long lived asset impairment charge of million in fiscal if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates regarding these factors  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
costs associated with exit activities the calculation of our location closing liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the timing and duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income 
when making these assumptions  we consider a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to additional charges that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would require calculation of a location closing liability at this time 
insurance we retain a portion of the risk related to certain general liability  workers compensation  property loss and employee medical and dental claims 
liabilities associated with these losses are calculated for claims filed  and claims incurred but not yet reported  at our estimate of their ultimate cost  based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
our liability for workers compensation is discounted as payments are projected to be made over an extended period of time 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
our outstanding convertible notes carry a fixed rate of interest until august   after which the rate will float at a fixed spread of over the federal funds rate from a minimum of to a maximum of 
our floating rate indebtedness was million at january  and million at january  if short term floating interest rates on the average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding for each of the respective fiscal years 
we have not contracted for any derivative financial instruments 
we have no international sales  however  we import certain items for sale in our stores 
substantially all of our purchases are denominated in us dollars
