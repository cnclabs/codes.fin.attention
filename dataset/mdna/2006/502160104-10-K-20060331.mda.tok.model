certain statements contained in this md a may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview general we are a diversified holding company 
our wholly owned subsidiary  thermaclime  through its subsidiaries  owns substantially all of our core businesses consisting of the climate control business engaged in the manufacturing and selling of a broad range of air conditioning and heating products consisting of water source heat pumps including geothermal heat pumps  hydronic fan coils  large custom air handlers and other products used in commercial and residential new building construction  renovation of existing buildings and replacement of existing systems 
chemical business engaged in the manufacturing and selling of chemical products produced from three plants in texas  arkansas and alabama for the industrial  mining and agricultural markets 
climate control business most of the products of the climate control business are produced to customer orders that are placed well in advance of required delivery dates 
as a result  the climate control business carries significant backlogs that eliminate the necessity to carry substantial inventories other than for firm customer orders 
the backlog of confirmed orders in our climate control business has increased to approximately million as of december  as compared to a backlog of approximately million at december  the increase in our backlog relates primarily to the increase in demand for our water source heat pumps  large custom handlers and hydronic fan coils 
we anticipate shipping this backlog during in response to a record order intake level of our heat pump products  we have recently increased our unit output by over through additional shifts and overtime 
in addition  throughout and into over million will have been invested in fabrication equipment and plant wide process control systems 
this investment is expected to further raise capacity and reduce overtime 
the climate control business has historically generated consistent annual profits and positive cash flows and continues to do so 
management s objectives for the climate control business include the continued emphasis on increasing the sales and operating margins of all products and to continue to develop new products 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our climate control business will continue to launch new products and product upgrades in an effort to maintain our current market position and to establish presence in new markets 
in recent periods  the climate control business profitability was affected by operating losses of certain new product lines being developed over the past few years 
in  the emphasis has been to increase the sales levels of these operations above the breakeven point 
during  the results for these new products did not improve significantly  although we continued to see improvement in the long term prospects for these new products 
from october through january  our climate control business received approximately million in new orders for these new products 
chemical business the chemical business has nitrogen production facilities in baytown  texas baytown facility  el dorado  arkansas el dorado facility and cherokee  alabama cherokee facility 
the el dorado and baytown facilities produce nitrogen products from anhydrous ammonia that is delivered by pipeline 
the cherokee facility produces nitrogen products from natural gas that is delivered by pipeline 
anhydrous ammonia and natural gas are commodities  subject to significant price fluctuations  generally purchased at prices in effect at time of purchase 
due to the uncertainty of the sales prices of our products in relation to the cost of anhydrous ammonia and natural gas  we have developed some customers that purchase substantial quantities of products pursuant to sales agreements and or formulas that provide for the pass through of raw material costs  variable costs  and certain fixed costs  plus in most cases  a profit margin 
these pricing arrangements help mitigate the commodity risk inherent in natural gas and anhydrous ammonia 
one of the customers who purchases a substantial amount of product pursuant to these pricing arrangements from our cherokee facility temporarily suspended their purchases in october due to the hurricane induced high cost of natural gas and resumed taking a limited amount of product in december  as spot purchases and as long as market conditions and the price of natural gas permit 
although anhydrous ammonia is produced from natural gas  the price does not necessarily follow the spot price of natural gas in the united states because much of the anhydrous ammonia consumed in our geographical area is produced off shore and delivered by pipeline that originates in the gulf of mexico 
our cost is based upon formulas indexed to published industry prices  primarily tied to import prices 
the production from our baytown facility is sold pursuant to a long term supply agreement that provides for the pass through of certain production costs including anhydrous ammonia 
this facility continues to generate consistent operating profits 
the el dorado facility produces approximately  tons of product per year 
approximately of the el dorado facility s products sold in were sold pursuant to pricing arrangements that transfer the cost of anhydrous ammonia to the customer 
the balance of the products sold was at the spot price in effect at time of shipment 
the el dorado facility s results for are significantly improved from despite the lost production of one of its four nitric acid plants during the first two quarters of the improvement in is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements primarily due to a more favorable balance between supply and demand in the markets for nitrogen products produced at the el dorado facility resulting in improved margins 
the cherokee facility produces nitrogen products from natural gas 
as a result of the sudden climb in the market price of natural gas during and delivery interruptions resulting from the hurricanes  the cherokee facility encountered a significant disruption in its operations 
the cherokee facility suspended production on september rd due to the inability to receive an adequate and reliable supply of natural gas from its natural gas pipeline 
due to damage to its delivery infrastructure caused by hurricane katrina  the pipeline had declared force majeure 
although the pipeline was still under force majeure  the cherokee facility was able to purchase interruptible delivery natural gas 
by october st  the cherokee facility resumed production 
during november and december  natural gas prices continued to climb to a high of approximately per mcf and management announced in december that production was being suspended again 
in mid january  cherokee resumed production at approximately two thirds normal production rates  although gas prices continued to be well above normal 
the inability to receive natural gas and the high natural gas costs resulting from both the hurricanes  the effect of the two shut downs and the loss of sales volume had a significant negative effect on the facility s results of operations for the third and fourth quarters of and continued to affect the results for the first quarter of as of march   the price of natural gas decreased to approximately per mcf 
we believe that the current market outlook justifies continuing production at the cherokee facility for the foreseeable future 
however  we could from time to time  suspend production at this facility due to  among other things  continuing high cost of its primary raw material  natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been  and will in the future be  materially affected by cost increases of raw materials 
in addition  the cherokee facility has a cost plus contract to supply a customer with its requirements for product each year through at least september which represented approximately of our chemical business s revenues during this customer has recently orally advised us that  although they have not made a final decision  they may be reducing the amount of product they purchase each year from the cherokee facility 
our baytown facility was also closed from september  until october  as a precautionary measure due to hurricane rita 
this facility did not sustain any damage due to the hurricane and its net operating results were not significantly impacted 
edc is a party to a supply agreement with orica usa  inc orica to supply orica approximately  tons of ammonia nitrate per year through at least march during  sales to orica represented approximately of our chemical business s revenues and approximately of our consolidated revenues 
edc and orica have agreed in principal to enter into a new five year agreement beginning january   with such new agreement to provide for certain price increases and an increase in the amount of product orica will take from edc each year 
this new agreement is subject to finalization of a definitive agreement 

table of contents 
index to financial statements liquidity and capital resources as a diversified holding company  cash requirements are primarily dependent upon credit agreements and our ability to obtain funds from our thermaclime and non thermaclime subsidiaries 
during march  we completed a private placement of million of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due to qualified institutional buyers 
these debentures are unsecured obligations  bear an interest rate of per annum and are convertible into our common stock at various conversion rates prior to their maturity on march  we may redeem these debentures at anytime on or after march  under certain conditions 
the redemption price is payable at our option in cash or  subject to certain conditions  in shares of our common stock 
at maturity  we may also elect to pay up to one half of the principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued and unpaid interest due thereon at maturity  in shares of our common stock 
if we pay the redemption price on any portion of the debentures at maturity in our common stock  our common stock is to be valued for these purposes at of the weighted average of the closing sales price of our common stock for the consecutive trading days ending on the th trading day prior to the applicable redemption date or maturity date 
we intend to use all or a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures which we estimate to be approximately million after paying commissions to the placement agent and our expenses relating to the offering to repay or purchase our debt or debt of our subsidiaries  including our subsidiary s million senior unsecured debentures due  and the balance  if any  for general corporate purposes 
pending such uses  the net proceeds will be invested in investments with highly rated money market funds  us government securities  treasury bills and or short term commercial paper 
historically  thermaclime s primary cash needs have been for working capital and capital expenditures 
thermaclime and its subsidiaries depend upon their working capital revolver loan  internally generated cash flows  and secured equipment financing in order to fund operations and pay obligations 
the working capital revolver loan and the senior secured loan have financial covenants that are discussed below under loan agreements terms and conditions 
thermaclime s ability to maintain an adequate amount of borrowing availability under its working capital revolver loan depends on its ability to comply with the terms and conditions of its loan agreements and its ability to generate cash flow from operations 
thermaclime is restricted under its credit agreements as to the funds it may transfer to lsb and its non thermaclime affiliates and certain thermaclime subsidiaries 
this limitation does not prohibit payment to lsb of amounts due under a services agreement  management agreement and a tax sharing agreement 
as of december  thermaclime had availability for additional borrowing under its working capital revolver loan of million 
although the chemical business results for are improved from  the chemical business in recent years prior to has not generated significant positive cash flows due to lower than optimum sales volume levels  margin problems and extensive capital expenditures 

table of contents 
index to financial statements as evident in the above discussion of the cherokee facility  the ability to generate a positive margin on chemical sales is affected by the volatility of the raw material feedstocks as well as the necessity to produce at the optimum production levels to fully absorb the fixed plant costs 
the predominant production costs of a process chemical plant  other than the raw material costs  tend to be fixed costs 
our primary efforts to improve the results of the chemical business include sales efforts to increase the non seasonal sales volumes of the cherokee and el dorado facilities with an emphasis on customers that will accept the commodity risk inherent with natural gas and anhydrous ammonia 
beginning in october and continuing into june  the chemical business results were adversely affected as a result of the loss of production due to a mechanical failure of one of the four nitric acid plants at the el dorado facility 
the plant was restored to normal production in june we filed a property damage insurance claim for million  net of a million deductible 
in  we recognized insurance recoveries of million under our replacement cost property insurance policy relating to this property damage claim 
the effect of this property insurance recovery to the accompanying consolidated statement of income was million for which is included in other income 
the proceeds from property insurance recoveries are classified as cash inflows from investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
the company used these proceeds for working capital purposes 
the insurers are contesting the remaining claim and we have instituted litigation against the insurers in connection with this claim 
additional recoveries  if any  upon final resolution will be recognized when realized 
in addition  we filed a claim for recovery of the business interruption losses related to this incident 
our business interruption insurance policy contains a forty five day waiting period before covering losses resulting from business interruptions 
the claim is for million  net of the forty five day waiting period 
in november  we realized insurance recoveries of million relating to this claim which is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
the proceeds from business interruption insurance recoveries are classified as cash inflows from operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
the company used the proceeds for general working capital purposes 
the negative impact on gross profit resulting from the lost production was approximately million in and approximately million in as of march   additional business interruption insurance payments totaling  were agreed to and paid by our insurers in which will be recognized in the first quarter of we have instituted litigation for the remaining balance 
additional recoveries  if any  related to this business interruption will be recognized when realized 
in  we received proceeds of million from key individual life insurance policies due to the untimely death of one of our executives in january the effect from the life insurance proceeds to the accompanying statement of income was million for which is included in non operating other income  net 
these proceeds excluding a minimal amount relating to the cash surrender value of the underlying policies are classified as cash inflows from operating activities in the accompanying statement of cash flows 
the company used the proceeds for general working capital purposes 

table of contents 
index to financial statements capital expenditures our chemical business has historically required significant investment to fund capital expenditures  while our climate control business has been much less capital intensive 
we believe we have approximately million of committed capital expenditures for which includes million for our chemical business and million for a climate control business 
the million includes million relating to operations and million for environmental compliance 
we believe that we can fund the projected capital expenditures for from our working capital 
as discussed under environmental matters in item  the adeq issued to edc a new revised npdes water discharge permit in  and edc has until june to meet the compliance deadline for the more restrictive limits under the recently issued npdes permit 
in order to meet edc s effluent limits under the permit  edc had planned to utilize a pipeline to be built by the city of el dorado  arkansas the city 
the city council approved the joint pipeline  but construction of the pipeline by the city is subject to the city receiving a permit from the adeq 
the adeq has not issued the necessary permit to discharge wastewater into the pipeline and  as a result  this has caused a delay of unknown duration in construction of the pipeline 
this delay may impact our ability to meet our compliance schedule under the npdes permit 
as a result  edc has proposed to the adeq an extension of its compliance deadlines under its npdes permit but there are no assurances that the adeq will grant such extension 
if the city is not able to build its pipeline or can build it in a timely manner  edc intends to discharge its wastewater through the city s sewer system subject to obtaining a sewer discharge permit from the city and edc building a pipeline to the city s sewer system in a timely manner 
the estimated remaining capital expenditures to meet the requirements of the npdes permit ranges from 
million to million plus approximately million for our pro rata portion of pipeline engineering and construction costs should the city build a pipeline 
in addition  certain additional capital expenditures will be required to bring the sulfuric acid plant s air emissions to lower limits 
the ultimate cost is believed to be between million and million  to be expended through february  which began with minimal expenditures since other capital expenditures are believed to be discretionary and are dependent upon an adequate amount of liquidity and or obtaining acceptable funding 
we have carefully managed those expenditures to projects necessary to execute our business plans and those for environmental and safety compliance 
dividends we have not paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years  and since january  through december   we did not pay any accrued dividends on our outstanding cumulative preferred stock 
as of december   there was approximately million of unpaid dividends on our outstanding cumulative preferred stock 
we intend to retain most of our future earnings  if any  to provide funds for our operations and or expansion of our business 
however  on january   our board of directors declared a nominal quarterly dividend  payable march   to holders of record as of february   on certain outstanding series of our preferred stock 
this dividend is not for the full amount of the required quarterly dividend pursuant to the terms of all of our outstanding series of preferred stock 
as a result  the amount of unpaid dividends on our outstanding cumulative preferred stock increased to million as of march  there are no assurances that we will in the future pay any additional quarterly dividends on any of our outstanding shares of preferred stock 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in the foreseeable future  and until all unpaid dividends are paid on our outstanding cumulative preferred stock  no dividends may be paid on our common stock

index to financial statements compliance with long term debt covenants as discussed below under loan agreements terms and conditions  the senior secured loan and working capital revolver loan  as amended  of thermaclime and its subsidiaries require  among other things  that thermaclime meet certain lender defined earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  capital expenditure limitation amounts and achieve minimum fixed charge coverage ratios quarterly  on a trailing twelve month basis 
thermaclime s forecasts for indicate that thermaclime will be able to meet all required covenant tests for all quarters and the year ending december summary cash flow and liquidity will continue to be managed very carefully 
we believe  with the infusion of new capital as a result of the recently completed debenture offering and based upon current forecasts  that we will have adequate cash in from internal cash flows and financing sources to enable us to satisfy our cash requirements as they become due in due to the volatility of the cost for major raw materials  we have historically experienced revisions to financial forecasts on a frequent basis during the course of a year 
as a result  actual results may differ significantly from our forecast  which could have a material impact on our liquidity and future operating results 
in addition  our subsidiary  thermaclime  has its million in outstanding debentures becoming due in we intend to use the proceeds of the recent debentures offering to purchase or pay the debentures 
loan agreements terms and conditions working capital revolver loan thermaclime finances its working capital requirements through borrowings under a working capital revolver loan 
under the working capital revolver loan  thermaclime and its subsidiaries may borrow on a revolving basis up to million based on specific percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
effective february  the working capital revolver loan was amended which  among other things  extended the maturity date to april and removed language considered as a subjective acceleration provision 
as of december   borrowings outstanding were million and the net credit available for additional borrowings was million 
the working capital revolver loan requires that thermaclime and its climate control business meet certain financial covenants and minimum ebitda amounts 
the ebitda requirements are measured quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis 
thermaclime and its climate control business were in compliance with the required minimum ebitda amounts for the twelve month period ended december  the trailing twelve month ebitda requirements for ranges from million to million for thermaclime and million for the climate control business 
the ebitda requirements were set at amounts based upon our forecasts which are presently considered by management to be achievable 
see discussion under liquidity and capital resources summary as to the historical viability of our forecasts 
senior secured loan in september  thermaclime and certain of its subsidiaries the borrowers completed a million term loan senior secured loan with a certain lender the lender 
the senior secured loan is to be repaid as follows quarterly interest payments which began september   
table of contents 
index to financial statements quarterly principal payments of  beginning september   a final payment of the remaining outstanding principal of million and accrued interest on september  the senior secured loan accrues interest at the applicable libor rate  as defined  plus an applicable libor margin  as defined or  at the election of the borrowers  the alternative base rate  as defined  plus an applicable base rate margin  as defined  with the annual interest rate not to exceed or depending on the leverage ratio 
at december  the annual interest rate was 
the borrowers are subject to numerous affirmative and negative covenants under the senior secured loan agreement including  but not limited to  limitation on the incurrence of certain additional indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers  acquisitions  dissolution and sale of assets  and limitations on declaration of dividends and distributions to us  all with certain exceptions 
the borrowers are also subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  measured quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis 
the borrowers were in compliance with the required minimum ratio for the twelve month period ended december  and the coverage ratio is considered to be achievable for the maturity date of the senior secured loan can be accelerated by the lender upon the occurrence of a continuing event of default  as defined 
cross default provisions the working capital revolver loan agreement and the senior secured loan contain cross default provisions 
if thermaclime fails to meet the financial covenants of the senior secured loan  the lender may declare an event of default  making the debt due on demand 
if this should occur  there are no assurances that we would have funds available to pay such amount or that alternative borrowing arrangements would be available 
accordingly  thermaclime could be required to curtail operations and or sell key assets 
these actions could result in the recognition of losses that may be material 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingencies 
we had the following changes in accounting estimates during the recognition of  of soil remediation costs classified as discontinued operations as discussed under environmental matters of item and the recognition of  relating to a death benefit obligation classified as a selling  general and administrative expense due to the change in our ceo s estimated remaining service period 
in addition  the more significant areas of financial reporting impacted by management s judgment  estimates and assumptions include the following receivables and credit risk our sales to contractors and independent sales representatives are generally subject to a mechanics lien in the climate control business 
our other sales are generally unsecured 
credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the customer s financial condition and other factors 
credit losses are provided for in the financial statements based on historical experience and periodic assessment of outstanding accounts receivable  particularly those accounts which are past due determined based upon how recently payments have been received 
our periodic assessment of accounts and credit loss provisions are based on our best estimate of amounts that are not recoverable 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising our customer bases and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic areas  however  four customers account for approximately of our total net receivables at december  we do not believe this concentration in these four customers represents a significant credit risk due to the financial stability of these customers 
at december  and  our trade accounts receivable were net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
inventory valuations inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out basis 
finished goods and work in process inventories include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
at december  and  the carrying value of certain nitrogen based inventories produced by our chemical business was reduced to market because cost exceeded the net realizable value by million and million  respectively 
in addition  the carrying value of certain slow moving inventory items primarily climate control products was reduced to market because cost exceeded the net realizable value by million and 
million at december  and  respectively 
precious metals precious metals are used as a catalyst in the chemical business manufacturing processes 
precious metals are carried at cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo basis 
as of december  and  precious metals were million and million  respectively  and are included in supplies  prepaid items and other in the consolidated balance sheets 
because some of the catalyst consumed in the production process cannot be readily recovered and the amount and timing of recoveries are not predictable  we follow the practice of expensing precious metals as they are consumed 
for  and  the amounts expensed for precious metals were approximately million  million and million  respectively  and are included in cost of sales 
periodically  during major maintenance or capital projects we may be able to perform procedures to recover precious metals previously expensed which have accumulated within the manufacturing equipment 
for  and  we recognized recoveries of precious metals at historical fifo costs of approximately million  
million and million  respectively  which are reductions to cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets including goodwill long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if assets to be held and used are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets as measured by the present value of future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or their appraised value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amounts of the assets or fair values less costs to sell 
at december  we had no long lived assets that met the criteria presented in sfas to be classified as assets held for sale 
we have considered impairment of our long lived assets and related goodwill 
we obtained third party appraisals of the fair values associated with the cherokee facility and made 
table of contents 
index to financial statements estimates of fair values for others 
the timing of impairments cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty and are primarily dependent on market conditions outside our control 
should sales prices drop dramatically without a similar decline in the raw material costs or should other matters  including the environmental requirements and or operating requirements set by federal and state agencies change substantially from our current expectations  a provision for impairment may be required based upon such event or events 
see item business environmental matters 
during  and  based on estimates obtained from external sources and internal estimates based on inquiry and other techniques  we recognized impairments relating to certain non core equipment of   and  respectively  relating to corporate assets and   and  respectively  relating to certain capital spare parts and idle assets in our chemical business 
these impairments are included in other expense in the consolidated statements of income 
accrued insurance liabilities we are self insured up to certain limits for group health  workers compensation and general liability insurance claims 
above these limits  we have insurance coverage  which management considers to be adequate 
our accrued insurance liabilities are based on estimates of the self insured portions of the claims  which include the incurred claims amounts plus estimates of future claims development calculated by applying our historical claims development factors to our incurred claims amounts

in addition  our accrued insurance liabilities include estimates of incurred  but not reported  claims and other insurance related costs 
at december  and  our claims liabilities are million and million  respectively and are included in accrued liabilities 
product warranty our climate control business sells equipment for which we provide warranties covering defects in materials and workmanship 
generally the warranty coverage for manufactured equipment is limited to months from the date of shipment or months from the date of start up  whichever is shorter  and to days for spare parts 
in some cases  the customer may purchase an extended warranty 
our accounting policy and methodology for warranty arrangements is to periodically measure and recognize the expense and liability for such warranty obligations using a percentage of net sales  based on historical warranty costs 
it is possible that future warranty costs could exceed our estimates 
at december  and  our accrued product warranty obligations were million and million  respectively and are included in accrued and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
accrued plant turnaround costs we accrue in advance the cost expected to be incurred in the next planned major maintenance activities turnarounds of our chemical business 
turnaround costs are accrued on a straight line basis over the scheduled period between turnarounds  which generally ranges from to months 
at december  and  accrued and other noncurrent liabilities include million and million  respectively  relating to turnarounds 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working on a project to clarify guidance on the accounting for turnarounds 
in march  fasb decided to issue guidance in the form of a fasb staff position fsp to eliminate the accrue in advance method of accounting for turnarounds and to address transition guidance at a future fasb 
table of contents 
index to financial statements meeting and directed their staff staff to research the practicability of retrospective application 
the staff s immediate plans are to provide fasb with a recommendation on transition guidance after researching the practicability of accounting for the adoption of the provisions in the fsp as a change in accounting principle with retrospective application as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting changes and error corrections 
as discussed above  we are using the accrue in advance method for turnarounds that fasb may eliminate in the near future 
if the fsp was effective as of december   the pro forma effect on our consolidated balance sheet would be a decrease in accrued and other noncurrent liabilities and an increase in stockholders equity of  depending on the transition guidance provided  our preliminary analysis of the pro form effect on our consolidation statements of income would be a an increase in net income of  as a cumulative effect of accounting change for or b an increase decrease in net income of   and  for  and  respectively  and an increase in stockholders equity of  at december  executive benefit agreements we have entered into benefit agreements with certain key executives

as of december   the liability for death benefits is  none at december  which is included in accrued and other noncurrent liabilities 
the increase in the liability relates to the untimely death of one of our executives in january and the change in accounting estimate for ceo s remaining service period as discussed above 
environmental and regulatory compliance the chemical business is subject to specific federal and state regulatory and environmental compliance laws and guidelines 
we have developed policies and procedures related to environmental and regulatory compliance 
we must continually monitor whether we have maintained compliance with such laws and regulations and the operating implications  if any  and amount of penalties  fines and assessments that may result from noncompliance 
at december   liabilities totaling  have been accrued relating to a new consent administrative order cao and the slurry consent order 
these liabilities are based on current estimates that may be revised in the near term based on results of our investigation  risk assessment and remediation pursuant to the new cao and slurry consent order 
in addition  we will be required to make capital expenditures as it relates to the npdes permit and air cao

index to financial statements asset retirement obligations we have a legal obligation to monitor certain discharge water outlets at our chemical business facilities should we discontinue the operations of a facility 
we do not believe that the annual costs of the required monitoring activities would be significant and as we currently have no plans to discontinue the use of the facilities and the remaining life of either facility is indeterminable  an asset retirement liability has not been recognized 
however  we will continue to review this obligation and record a liability when a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made 
currently  there is insufficient information to estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes  and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we are able to realize deferred tax assets up to an amount equal to the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
the taxable temporary differences will turn around in the loss carry forward period as the differences reverse 
other differences will turn around as the assets are realized or liabilities are paid in the normal course of business 
at december  and  our deferred tax assets were net of a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively

contingencies we accrue for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we recognize contingent gains when such gains are realized 
we are a party to various litigation and other contingencies  the ultimate outcome of which is not presently known 
should the ultimate outcome of these contingencies be adverse  such outcome could create an event of default under thermaclime s working capital revolver loan and the senior secured loan and could adversely impact our liquidity and capital resources 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for substantially all of our operations at the time title to the goods transfers to the buyer and there remains no significant future performance obligations by us 
if revenue relates to construction contracts  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
recognition of insurance recoveries if our insurance claim relates to a recovery of losses  we recognize the recovery when it is probable and reasonably estimable 
if our insurance claim relates to a contingent gain  we recognize the recovery when it is realized 
management s judgment and estimates in these areas are based on information available from internal and external resources at that time 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and judgments  as additional information becomes known
