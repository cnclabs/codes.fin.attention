item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations insurance industry investigations and other developments and note  contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
contingent commissions are less predictable than our other revenues  which makes it difficult to forecast revenues  and decreases in these commissions may negatively impact our financial results 
many insurance companies pay us contingent commissions for achieving specified premium volume goals set by them and or the loss experience of the insurance we place with them 
we generally receive these commissions in the first and second quarters of each year  however  we have no control over the ability of insurance companies to estimate loss reserves  which affects the amount of contingent commissions that we will receive 
placement service revenue includes payments or allowances by insurance companies based upon such factors as the overall volume of business placed by the broker with that insurer  the aggregate commissions paid by the insurer for that business during specific periods or the profitability or loss to the insurer of the risks placed 
this revenue reflects compensation for services provided by brokers to the insurance market 
these services include new product development  the development and provision of technology  administration and the delivery of information on developments among broad client segments and the insurance markets 
in addition  because no significant incremental operating costs are incurred when contingent commissions are realized  a significant decrease in these commissions can cause a disproportionate decrease in net income 
any decrease in the contingent commissions we receive would reduce our revenues and  to a greater degree  decrease our income from continuing operations before income tax benefit  on a percentage basis 
a significant decrease in contingent commissions would consequently have a negative impact on our financial results and limit our ability to incur and service debt and comply with financial covenants in our existing credit facility 
for further information on the matters discussed see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations insurance industry investigations and other developments and note  contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
the cyclical nature of p c premium rates may make our financial results volatile and unpredictable 
commissions from the brokering of insurance products represent a majority of our revenues 
commissions are typically determined as a percentage of premium rates 
we have no control over the insurance premium rates on which these commissions are calculated 
for example  from through  the p c insurance industry experienced a period of flat to declining premium rates  which negatively affected 
table of contents commissions earned by insurance brokers 
starting in  years of underwriting losses for p c insurance companies combined with the downturn in the equity markets caused insurers to increase premium rates 
additionally  the insurance industry was affected by the events of september   which resulted in one of the largest insurance losses in america s history and accelerated increases in premium rates for particular lines of commercial p c insurance 
in response to rising premiums  some of our customers increased their deductibles and or reduced their insurance coverage in order to reduce the impact of the premium increases 
these trends prompted by the hard market negatively impacted our revenues 
the hard market  for many lines of insurance  began to slow in the second half of by the second half of  premiums in most p c lines of insurance began to flatten or decrease  with some  such as property  by as much as 
in and through  the soft market persisted  negatively affecting brokers revenue 
some clients use the savings on insurance premiums to purchase more coverage  somewhat offsetting the negative impact in our commissions due to falling premiums 
through  the competitive pricing dynamic was consistent throughout most account sizes and most geographic regions  with the workers compensation market in california a notable exception where we have seen premiums decline by as much as 
if the soft market persists  it may continue to negatively impact our p c insurance brokerage revenues 
we act as brokers for state insurance funds such as those in california which could choose to reduce brokerage commissions and or contingent commissions we receive  which could negatively affect our financial results 
in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance  states have from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools  which compete directly  on a subsidized basis  with private insurance providers 
we act as agents and brokers for state insurance funds such as those in california and other states in which we operate 
these state funds could choose to reduce the brokerage commissions and or contingent commissions we receive 
if these reductions in commissions occurred in a state in which we have substantial operations  such as california  they could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in that state or cause us to change our marketing focus 
in addition  any decrease in these commissions would reduce our revenues and  to a greater degree  decrease our income from continuing operations before income taxes  on a percentage basis 
a significant decrease in these commissions would consequently have a negative impact on our financial results and limit our ability to incur and service debt and comply with financial covenants in our credit facility 
government regulation and resulting market dynamics relating to the group health plans we sell could negatively affect our financial results 
as an employee benefits broker  we provide our clients access to group health insurance products and services as well as advice on benefit plan design 
reform of the health care system is a topic of discussion at both the state and federal levels in the united states 
proposed bills and regulations vary widely and range from reform of the existing employer based system of insurance to a single payer  public program 
several groups are urging consideration by the congress of a national health care plan 
if any of these initiatives ultimately become effective  they could have a material effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products and services we sell or on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on key sales and management professionals who could end their employment with us  which could negatively affect our financial results and impair our ability to implement our business strategy 
our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain senior management and the individual sales professionals and teams that service our clients and maintain client relationships 
if key sales professionals and senior managers were to end their employment with us  or if we experience significant turnover among our key sales professionals  it could negatively affect the execution of our business strategy  disrupt our client relationships and have a corresponding negative effect on our financial results  marketing and other objectives 
table of contents and impair our ability to implement our strategy 
our senior managers and substantially all of our sales professionals are subject to employment agreements containing confidentiality and non solicitation provisions 
if any of them were to leave and litigate to be released from these agreements  it could lead to costly litigation and some courts may not enforce these agreements 
the loss of the services of david l 
eslick  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could adversely affect our ability to carry out our business plan 
although we operate with a decentralized management system  the services of david l 
eslick  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  are key to the development and implementation of our business plan  including our growth strategy 
the loss of mr 
eslick s services could  therefore  adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results 
further expenses related to margin improvement efforts and acquisition integration charges could adversely affect our financial results and negatively impact the price of our common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced that our board of directors had approved a margin improvement plan in order to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
as a result of this action  in  we recorded expense of million comprised of employee severance and related benefits for employees of million  facilities closures of million  the modification of sales professionals agreements of million and service contract termination fees of million 
in  we recorded additional margin improvement plan expense of million comprised of employee severance and related benefits of million and the modification of sales professionals agreements of million 
in the future we may incur similar costs as we grow and refine our operating structure 
further margin improvement efforts may result in similar or greater expenses  which could negatively affect our financial results 
if this were to occur  the price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
in addition  as part of our acquisition of summit global partners  inc  we restructured the agreements of certain sales professionals and executives 
as a result of these efforts  we recorded expenses of million in the first quarter of in exchange for this consideration  the employment agreements were conformed to our standard compensation structure for sales professionals and regional executives 
further integration of our existing businesses and businesses we may acquire in the future may result in similar or greater integration expenses  which could negatively affect our financial results 
if this were to occur  the price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our business  financial condition and or results may be negatively affected by errors and omissions claims 
we have extensive operations and are subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business resulting from alleged errors and omissions in placing insurance and handling claims 
the placement of insurance and the handling of claims involve substantial amounts of money 
since errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question  claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims can involve significant defense costs 
errors and omissions could include  for example  our employees or sub agents failing  whether negligently or intentionally  to place coverage or file claims on behalf of clients  to appropriately and adequately disclose insurer fee arrangements to our clients  to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis 
it is not always possible to prevent or detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases 
the coverage limits and the amount of related deductibles of our errors and omissions insurance coverage are established annually based upon our assessment of our errors and omissions exposure  loss experience and the availability and pricing within the marketplace 
our premiums and deductibles associated with the purchase of errors and omission coverages may be higher in certain years because of adverse market conditions for buyers of these coverages 
recently  prices have increased and coverage terms have become far more restrictive because of 
table of contents reduced insurer capacity in the marketplace 
while we endeavor to purchase coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of our risk  it is possible that the frequency  nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages increases  negatively impacting our financial results 
our business  financial condition and or results may be negatively affected if in the future our errors and omissions insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable 
in addition  errors and omissions claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
competition in our industry is intense and  if we are unable to compete effectively  we may lose clients and our financial results may be negatively affected 
we face competition in both our insurance brokerage and specialized benefits services segments 
we compete for clients on the basis of reputation  client service  program  price and product offerings and the ability to tailor our products and services to the specific needs of a client 
our client base fluctuates over time as a result of competition in our industry as well as other factors 
if we lose one or more of our larger clients and are not able to replace them or otherwise mitigate our loss sufficiently  our financial results could be negatively affected 
additionally  a substantial portion of our business is nonrecurring and must be replaced with new sales each year 
in our insurance brokerage segment  competition is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market 
we believe that most of our competition is from numerous local and regional brokerage firms that focus primarily on middle market businesses and  to a lesser extent  from larger national brokerage firms 
in addition  insurance companies compete with us by directly soliciting clients without the assistance of an independent broker or agent 
additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants  such as banks  securities firms  accounting firms and other institutions that offer insurance related products and services 
our specialized benefits services segment competes with consulting firms  brokers  third party administrators  producer groups and insurance companies 
a number of our competitors offer attractive alternative programs 
we believe that most of our competition is from large  diversified financial services organizations that are willing to expend significant resources to enter our markets and from larger competitors that pursue an acquisition or consolidation strategy similar to ours 
we also compete with other brokers and other financial institutions that pursue an acquisition or consolidation strategy similar to ours 
these include arthur j 
gallagher  brown brown  hilb  rogal hobbs  hub international limited and lockton companies  inc  as well as a number of regional banks 
our high level of indebtedness may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to insurance brokers and other distributors of financial products and services 
as of december   our total indebtedness of million and our total indebtedness measured as a percentage of our total capitalization of were higher than those of brokers that we consider to be generally comparable to us  including arthur j 
gallagher and brown brown 
as a result  we may be less able to compete effectively with our peers when acquiring other brokerage operations that are seeking cash purchase consideration versus stock purchase consideration 
additionally  with a lower level of indebtedness  our peers are likely to have greater flexibility to direct cash flow from operations toward hiring additional sales professionals  capital expenditures and other forms of reinvestment in their businesses than we have currently 
failure to comply with financial covenants in our credit facility could cause all or a portion of our debt to become immediately due and payable 
under our credit facility  we must comply with financial covenants which limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions 

table of contents amounts due under our credit facility and under future debt instruments could become immediately due and payable as a result of our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants they contain  which  in turn  could cause all or a portion of our other debt to become immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with these provisions in existing or future debt instruments may be affected by events beyond our control 
if we are required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets  our financial condition and results would be negatively affected 
when we acquire a business  a substantial portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and any excess is recorded as goodwill 
under current accounting standards  if we determine that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired  we will be required to write down the value of such assets 
because goodwill and intangible assets comprise such a large percentage of our stockholders equity  any such write down would have a significant negative effect on our stockholders equity and financial results 
the geographic concentration of our businesses could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn or regulatory changes in those areas  resulting in a decrease in our revenues 
for the years ended december   and  our california and new york based businesses constituted approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
because our business is concentrated in these two states  the occurrence of adverse economic conditions or an adverse regulatory climate in either california or new york could negatively affect our financial results more than would be the case if our business were more geographically diversified 
failure to comply with regulations applicable to us could restrict our ability to conduct our business 
we conduct business in a number of states and are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in many of the states in which we do business 
state laws grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers 
our ability to conduct our business in the states in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations established by the regulatory authorities in each of these states 
state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners continually re examine existing laws and regulations  some of which affect us  including those relating to the licensing of insurance brokers and agents  premium rates  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  the regulation of the handling and investment of insurance carrier funds held in a fiduciary capacity  and regulation of business practices generally  including our compensation arrangements with insurers and clients 
these examinations may result in the enactment of insurance related laws and regulations  or the issuance of interpretations of existing laws and regulations  that adversely affect our business 
more restrictive laws  rules or regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult and or expensive 
specifically  recently adopted federal financial services modernization legislation addressing privacy issues  among other matters  is expected to lead to additional federal regulation of the insurance industry in the coming years  which could result in increased expenses or restrictions on our operations 
in response to perceived excessive cost or inadequacy of available insurance  states have also from time to time created state insurance funds and assigned risk pools  which compete directly  on a subsidized basis  with private insurance providers 
we act as agents and brokers for state insurance funds such as those in california  new york and other states in which we operate 
these state funds could choose to reduce the sales or brokerage commissions we receive 
in addition  these states could enact legislation to reform existing p c and individual and group health care insurance regulations 
if these reductions in commissions or changes in legislation occurred in a state in which we have substantial operations  such as california or new york  they could substantially affect the profitability of our operations in that state or cause us to change our marketing focus 

table of contents we depend on our information processing systems 
interruption or loss of our information processing systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to provide administrative services depends on our capacity to store  retrieve  process and manage regionally centralized databases and expand and upgrade periodically our information processing capabilities 
interruption or loss of our information processing capabilities through loss of stored data  breakdown or malfunctioning of computer equipment and software systems  telecommunications failure  or damage caused by fire  tornadoes  lightning  electrical power outage or other disruption at these centralized locations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part ii item of this report 
certain information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements included in this report 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of various factors  including those discussed above and elsewhere herein 
management overview business we are a distributor of property and casualty p c and employee benefits insurance and financial products and related consulting and administrative services primarily to small and mid sized business clients and individuals 
in our role as an insurance intermediary  we may act as an agent on behalf of the insurance companies we represent  or as a broker  working without any particular insurance company affiliation 
we generate revenues and cash primarily from commissions paid by insurance companies on the placement of p c and employee benefits insurance  fees paid directly by clients and other third parties for either p c or employee benefit related services  and interest income 
commissions on p c  health  group life and group disability insurance are typically calculated as a percentage  ranging from approximately to  of the annual premium 
these commissions generally recur at the same rate as long as the insurance is in force 
commissions earned from the placement of individual and corporate owned life and individual disability insurance are calculated as a percentage of corresponding premiums over the duration or term of the underlying policies 
traditionally  most of the commission revenue on these life and individual products  as well as on other traditional voluntary benefit products  is recognized in the first year the insurance is placed  with the commissions paid in renewal years being relatively insignificant 
we also receive contingent commissions  which are incremental compensation for achieving specified loss experience and or account retention and premium volume goals set by the insurance companies for the business we place with them 
contingent commissions are recorded on the earlier of receipt of cash or when we receive data from the insurance companies that allows us to reasonably determine the amount 
contingent commissions and other forms of placement services revenues paid by insurance companies to brokers are under scrutiny by various regulators 
please refer to further discussion below under insurance industry investigations and other developments 
fee based revenues are generally billed and recorded as services are rendered 
we have two operating segments insurance brokerage and specialized benefits services and a third administrative segment corporate 
see discussion under results of operations below 
in and  we announced our intentions to sell or otherwise dispose of seven operations that did not fit our core business strategy 
most of these operations were in locations where we did not believe we could grow  and were  therefore  geographically undesirable 
we also sold our executive benefits operations which were subject to legislative risks beyond our control and highly unpredictable revenue and earnings streams 
as of december   all of these operations had been sold 
we may in the future decide to sell other operations as our business strategy evolves or as we acquire companies with undesirable lines of business or locations 
please read note  discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
insurance industry investigations and other developments since october   the insurance industry has been under a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies  including state attorneys general and the departments of insurance for various states  with 
table of contents respect to industry practices  including contingent compensation arrangements 
along with a number of other insurance brokers  we have received subpoenas from the office of the attorney general of the state of connecticut  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york and the florida attorney general s office requesting documents and seeking information as part of their industry wide investigations relating to pricing and placement of insurance 
we have also received an investigative demand from the department of justice of the state of north carolina seeking similar information 
the investigations center upon  among other items  allegations of bid rigging  tying arrangements and other fraudulent or unlawful business practices 
we have cooperated fully with these requests and will continue to cooperate with regulators as they refine  prioritize and or expand the areas of inquiry in their subpoenas and information requests 
in addition to the state attorney general investigations described above  a number of state departments of insurance have begun inquiries into compensation practices of brokers  agents and insurers as they affect consumers in their respective states 
we have received and responded  or are in the process of responding  to inquiries from insurance regulators in several states 
the resolution of these matters may harm our business and or lead to a decrease in or elimination of contingent commissions and override commissions  which would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
due to the uncertainties involved  management cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible loss 
following the allegations of bid rigging and price fixing in the lawsuit filed by the office of the attorney general of the state of new york against marsh and mclennan companies  inc  we retained outside counsel  akin gump strauss hauer feld  llp akin gump  to render legal advice in connection with an internal review of our operations 
since that time  akin gump has assisted us in responding to the subpoenas and inquiries described above 
in connection with this internal review  akin gump has interviewed more than of our employees  including corporate management  and is continuing its review of documents 
we are continuing to review our business and have made a number of improvements to our internal controls and compliance framework and expect that our review will not only address the areas that the regulators are examining  but will also help us evaluate where we can make additional operational or business practice changes or improvements 
since october  the industry s long standing contingent commission compensation arrangements have been a focal point of scrutiny by various regulators and  in fact  some of the largest brokers within the industry have abandoned the practice of receiving such contingent commissions 
in  we received substantially all of our contingent commissions under the arrangements in place for additionally  our carriers with whom we have historically had contingent arrangements  have entered into contingent commission agreements in a form and structure generally consistent with our prior agreements 
market or other external forces may ultimately cause contingent commission arrangements to cease or be substantively restructured  however  management does expect to receive contingent commissions in for arrangements established in revenues from contingent and override commissions were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
contingent and override commissions contribution to income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended december  and was approximately equivalent to the revenues from contingent and override commissions for each period 
industry class action litigation 
we have been named as one of more than insurance company and insurance brokerage defendants in an amended complaint filed in the united states district court southern district of new york in a putative class action lawsuit captioned opticare health systems  inc v 
marsh mclennan companies  inc  et al 
civil action no 
cv dc 
the amended complaint focuses on the payment of contingent commissions by insurers to insurance brokers who sell their insurance and alleged bid rigging in the setting of insurance premium levels 
the amended complaint purports to allege violations of 
table of contents numerous laws including the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico and federal restraint of trade statutes  state restraint of trade  unfair and deceptive practices statutes and state breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment laws 
the amended complaint seeks class certification  treble damages for the alleged injury suffered by the putative plaintiff class and other damages 
we are also a defendant in copycat or tag along lawsuits in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois lewis v 
marsh mclennan companies  inc  et al  c and preuss v 
marsh mclennan companies  inc  et al  c  and during april  we were served in another copycat class action lawsuit  captioned palm tree computers systems  inc et ano v

like the opticare complaint  these complaints contain no particularized allegations of wrongdoing on our part 
in february  the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation transferred the actions then pending to the united states district court for the district of new jersey for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings 
the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation has transferred the palm tree and bensley lawsuits to the same court for the same purposes 
on august   in the multidistrict litigation pending in the united states district court for the district of new jersey  the plaintiffs filed a first consolidated amended commercial class action complaint and a first consolidated employee benefits class action complaint the consolidated mdl complaints that purport to allege claims against us based upon rico  federal and state antitrust laws  breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary and unjust enrichment 
the consolidated mdl complaints  like the predecessor complaints  focus the allegations of fact upon defendants other than ourselves 
we have moved to dismiss the consolidated mdl complaints 
none of the plaintiffs in any of the actions has set forth the amounts being sought in the particular actions

in october  a group of affiliated plaintiffs  who are our competitors in the insurance brokerage and risk management business  filed a complaint in the chancery court of the circuit court of cook county  illinois  against us and two of our illinois based and one of our california based officers employees who previously worked for one of the plaintiffs  various other third party individuals and an insurance brokerage 
plaintiffs complaint seeks from all defendants unspecified compensatory damages and punitive damages related to claims for  among other things  tortious interference with client relationships  violation of state trade secrets laws and civil conspiracy 
we  our officers and employees asserted various defenses to this action  and our insurance carriers are involved in the defense of the litigation 
in march  our california based officer was dismissed from the litigation 
in november  the illinois court dismissed all of the claims asserted against us and our officers and employees for failing to meet illinois pleading requirements and the court gave plaintiffs an additional opportunity to attempt to meet those requirements 
in december  plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint and in february  we filed another motion to dismiss all claims asserted against us and our officers and employees based on several grounds  including the grounds previously accepted by the court 
on october   the illinois court again dismissed all of the claims asserted against us and our officers and employees 
a hearing was held before the illinois court on october   at which the judge ruled that the plaintiffs could not seek to re plead certain claims against us 
however  as to certain remaining claims  the judge granted leave to file a fourth amended pleading against us and our officers and employees 

table of contents plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint which we believe failed to state any amended claims against us  and we filed a motion to dismiss that complaint 
on september   the court dismissed all claims against us with prejudice 
near north will be able to appeal from this dismissal after a final appealable order is entered by the court 
we continue to believe that the plaintiffs allegations against us are without merit

market property casualty insurance premium pricing within the commercial p c insurance industry has historically been cyclical  based on the underwriting capacity of the insurance industry and economic conditions 
we use the terms soft market and hard market to describe the business cycles experienced by the industry 
a soft market is an insurance market characterized by a period of declining premium rates  which negatively affect commissions earned by insurance brokers 
a hard market is an insurance market characterized by a period of rising premium rates which  absent other changes  positively affects commissions earned by insurance brokers 
additionally  the insurance industry was affected by the events of september   resulting in the one of the largest insurance losses in america s history  which accelerated increases in premium rates for particular lines of commercial p c insurance 
in response to rising premiums  some of our customers increased their deductibles and or reduced their insurance coverage in order to reduce the impact of the premium increases 
these trends prompted by the hard market negatively impacted our revenues 
the hard market  for many lines of insurance  began to slow in the second half of in the second half of  premiums in most p c lines of insurance began to flatten or decrease  with some  such as property  declining by as much as 
in and  the soft market persisted in most lines of business  negatively affecting brokers revenue 
some clients use the savings on insurance premiums to purchase more coverage  somewhat offsetting the negative impact in our commissions due to falling premiums 
in  the competitive pricing dynamic was consistent throughout all account sizes and most geographic regions  with the workers compensation market in california a notable exception where we have seen premiums decline by as much as 
if the soft market persists  our p c insurance brokerage revenues may continue to be negatively impacted 
the storms which occurred in the third quarter of in the gulf coast and florida make it likely that premium rates for property in catastrophe prone geographic areas will increase in the near term 
however  through the remainder of we did not see a material positive impact to our revenues attributable to increasing premiums due to the storm losses 
it is also possible that rates for florida based risks  one of the few markets not significantly affected by the soft market  will continue to increase 
it is not possible to predict the ultimate effect  if any  of these catastrophic storms on the broader p c market  however  if the soft market slows  or we see rates increase in some or most lines of coverage  our p c insurance brokerage revenues may be positively impacted 
employee benefits premium rates in the health insurance industry have generally realized a consistent upward trend due to increasing health care delivery costs 
from to  however  we believe that the upward trend in health care insurance premiums was somewhat offset by the impact of the economic downturn and its resulting negative impact on business and employment levels at our customers 
additionally  reduced spending by some of our corporate clients has led to benefit cut backs and lower expenditures on consulting and other fee based services 
our employee benefits business is most affected by employment levels and by the strength of the economy 
factors such as a tight labor market may increase employers spending on benefits  high employment increases the numbers of lives covered within the benefit plans that we broker  and a strong stock market may increase both existing assets under management and new investments 
in  we saw the signs of an improving economy  although we did not see the benefits of sustained growing labor ranks or increased spending on benefits reflected in our health welfare revenues as employers continued to mitigate medical cost increases 

table of contents in  the economy continued to improve with positive growth in employment  which  in the second half of and throughout  drove growth in our employee benefits revenues 
we believe that many employers  however  are still struggling with medical inflation  which may result in continued benefit reductions and cost shifting to employees  which may serve to reduce insurance premiums or cause participants to opt out of their employers plan 
this unfavorable dynamic for the benefits brokerage business has led to greater opportunity  however  in our workplace marketing business  which is aided by the trend to defined contribution health care where employees direct their benefit dollars to purchase voluntary benefits a la carte 
primary financial measures the primary financial measures that we use to evaluate our performance are organic revenue growth decline  which excludes the current period s total revenues attributable to acquisitions and the prior period s total revenues from divested businesses during the twelve months following an acquisition or divestiture  and cash earnings per share  which we define as income from continuing operations plus amortization of intangible assets on a diluted per share basis 
in and  cash earnings per share was adjusted for expenses related to acquisition integration efforts  the margin improvement plan and other charges 
you should not consider these financial measures as alternatives to other financial measures determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as gaap  or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities  investing activities or financing activities  or as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  please note that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  the presentation of these measures in this report is not necessarily comparable to those of other companies 
we strongly urge investors or potential investors in our stock to review the calculation of organic revenue growth decline and the related reconciliation to gaap financial measures in results of operations below 
management s strategic objectives our business strategy is to grow our cash earnings per share each year 
we have a three pronged strategy to accomplish this goal organic growth in revenues  operating margin improvement and disciplined and accretive acquisitions 
organic revenue growth our strategy for achieving organic growth includes client stewardship and retention best practices  cross selling across all of our major product categories within our business segments  consistent and aggressive sales management  including recruitment and development of new sales professionals  new client origination  aggressive recruitment of new sales talent  and maintaining a balanced mix of p c and employee benefits revenues to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in market cycles 
we believe that growing revenues must start with keeping our existing clients 
we emphasize client service and account retention in our company best practices 
additionally  within our client base  we have identified 
table of contents what we call stewardship accounts 
stewardship accounts are generally our larger accounts and in total comprise approximately one third of our total revenues 
each account has an annual stewardship plan  which includes periodic client meetings  timely pre renewal procedures and an annual meeting with an executive client advocate 
we believe that our sales management model is among the most disciplined in our industry 
sales management begins with each sales professional s annual plan  which considers renewing business and expectations of new and lost accounts 
sales professionals are required to use a sales force automation system to track their sales activity  including sold business and prospecting activity 
each sales professional s activity is reviewed not less than bi weekly by local management in formal sales meetings and monthly by corporate management 
in addition to organic revenue growth  we monitor and manage to a number of different operating statistics related to revenue growth  including  but not limited to  sales opportunities by sales professional  cross selling within our largest accounts  client retention rates and revenue mix by operating company 
these metrics are tracked and reported monthly and form the basis of our agenda  among other items  for our monthly operations meetings with each of our business unit executive management teams 
operating margin improvement we are focused on increasing margins by restructuring the mix of incentive versus guaranteed compensation  consolidating office space and back office processes  standardizing our sales professionals compensation formula  implementing best practices in operations  leveraging our purchasing power and lowering the cost of our information technology through the consolidation of data centers 
we benchmark all expense categories and work with operating company management to develop and implement remediation plans for business units performing below our standards 
additionally  we continue to capitalize on opportunities to leverage our corporate and other fixed costs across a greater revenue base by acquiring fold in and other accretive businesses within our current geographic footprint 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced that our board of directors had approved a margin improvement plan in order to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
as a result of this action  in  we recorded expense of million comprised of employee severance and related benefits for employees of million  facilities closures of million  the modification of sales professionals agreements of million and service contract termination fees of million 
in  we recorded additional margin improvement plan expense of million comprised of employee severance and related benefits of million and the modification of sales professionals agreements of million 
in the future we may incur similar costs as we grow and refine our operating structure 
acquisition strategy in most acquisitions  we issue a combination of cash  seller notes and or common stock 
we also frequently structure our acquisition agreements to include purchase price payments contingent upon reaching specified financial targets  commonly referred to as earn outs  which are paid in a combination of cash  seller notes and common stock and are treated as adjustments to purchase price when the contingency is resolved 
additionally  many of our acquisitions have provisions for reduced consideration based on the failure to meet certain financial targets 
all acquisitions greater than million in aggregate purchase price require approval of our board of directors and  if greater than million in aggregate purchase price  also require that we give notice to our bank lenders 
please read note  acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for more information on acquisitions 
we centrally manage our target acquisitions from the point of initial contact through the process of integration within our operations 
we only consider transactions that are accretive to our cash earnings per share 

table of contents all acquisitions are subject to a due diligence process  including an introduction to our culture and business strategy  the seller s commitment to both our sales and client service model and to a post acquisition integration plan 
currently  we are looking to expand within our existing geographic footprint of operations to maximize efficiencies and continue to build out the balanced revenue mix of p c and employee benefits business  however  we will consider strategic opportunities in new geographies if they are compelling 
on february   we acquired patterson smith associates psa  an insurance brokerage operation 
the aggregate preliminary purchase price of approximately million  consisting of cash of million  shares of our common stock valued at million and debt issued of million  was allocated primarily to goodwill and other intangible assets 
this acquisition is included in the insurance brokerage segment 
on february   we acquired summit global partners sgp  an insurance brokerage operation 
the aggregate preliminary purchase price of approximately million  consisting of cash of million  shares of our common stock valued at million and assumed liabilities of million  was allocated primarily to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the sgp acquisition  we recorded million in expense in the first quarter of related to the restructuring of certain sgp sales professionals and executives employment agreements 
this consideration was not included in purchase price for accounting purposes  but was deducted from the agreed upon purchase consideration 
this acquisition is included in the insurance brokerage segment 
on september   we acquired richard b 
cross associates  inc cro  a retail employee benefits operation 
the aggregate preliminary purchase price of approximately million  consisting of a cash down payment of million and debt issued of million  was allocated primarily to goodwill and intangible assets 
there is also a potential for contingent consideration based upon specific growth incentives and identified revenues through december  this acquisition is included in the insurance brokerage segment 
on october   we acquired dascit white winston  inc dww  a small group benefit general agent 
the aggregate preliminary purchase price of million  consisting of cash of million and notes payable of million  was allocated primarily to goodwill and intangible assets 
this acquisition is included in the insurance brokerage segment 
six additional acquisitions were completed during  none of which had acquired assets greater than million 
the total aggregate preliminary purchase price of approximately million  consisting of cash of million  an obligation on one acquisition to pay minimum additional future consideration of million and shares of our common stock valued at million  was allocated primarily to goodwill and intangible assets 
in substantially all of the acquisitions  there is a contingent consideration portion based primarily upon retained revenues 
five of the acquisitions are included in our insurance brokerage segment and the sixth acquisition is included in our specialized benefits services segment 
quarterly fluctuations our quarterly revenues and operating income may be volatile 
this is attributable to the following a significant percentage of commissions and fees in our specialized benefits services segment is typically earned and recorded in the fourth quarter  the timing of certain core benefits and enrollment sales with significant first year commissions  and the impact of variations or timing in recording contingent commissions in our insurance brokerage segment  primarily in the first and second quarters 
quarterly fluctuations in revenues and operating income make our performance less predictable due to our life insurance  core benefits and specialized benefits services revenues 
the timing of certain aspects of our revenue stream  particularly in the specialized benefits services segment  makes comparisons of any period of 
table of contents less than a full year difficult 
we have implemented various strategies to reduce the impact of seasonal and uneven revenue streams  such as diversification of our business model for enrollment business to generate more revenue in the first three quarters of the year and divesting significantly volatile non core business 
we continue to focus on strategies that will provide a more predictable revenue stream  however  we cannot predict if we will be successful in these efforts or if market or other changes will result in a similar or greater level of unpredictability 
critical accounting estimates and policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of our accounting policies require management s judgment to estimate values of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
in addition  it may require significant judgment to apply complex principles of accounting to certain transactions  such as acquisitions  to determine the most appropriate accounting treatment 
we believe the following significant accounting estimates and policies are material to our financial condition or results of operations and are subject to a higher degree of subjectivity and or complexity 
we continually evaluate our estimates  which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
if actual performance should differ from historical experience or if our assumptions were to change  it may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
please read note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for a description of other significant accounting policies 
direct bill revenue recognition we record commission income on premiums billed and collected directly by insurance companies direct bill on the policy effective date for personal and commercial p c insurance placements and on the effective date of each installment for employee benefit insurance placements 
as reported in our form q for the quarterly periods ended september   june  and september   as part of our review of internal controls in compliance with sarbanes oxley section  we determined the need to enhance field office and corporate controls over our receivables and related producer compensation expense recorded for revenue on policies billed directly by insurance companies  or direct bill receivables 
beginning in the third quarter of  we implemented a new system called captiva  which allows us to calculate and record the receivable and revenue and the related compensation payable and expense for each commercial lines p c direct bill policy at the time it is effective 
as a result of this process  we have obtained additional information which management has utilized to adjust its estimate of the direct bill receivable and related compensation payable 
for the year ended december   the effect of the change in estimate was a decrease to our direct bill revenues of million and a decrease in the related producer compensation expenses of million 
as of december   we have completed our migration to the improved estimation methodology for direct bill and do not expect any further material adjustments 
allowances for bad debts and policy cancellations we maintain allowances for bad debts and estimated policy cancellations on our insurance brokerage business based on our premiums  commissions and fees receivable and historical cancellation trends 
the policy cancellations component represents a reserve against receivables for future reversals of commission revenue on insurance policies in force at year end and is established through a charge to revenues  while the bad debt component is established through a charge to other operating expenses 
the allowances are determined based on estimates and assumptions using historical data to project future experience  and  in the case of bad debts  a 
table of contents specific identification of questionable items 
we periodically review the adequacy of the allowances and make adjustments as necessary 
future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in the trend of write offs or cancellations which could increase due to changes in economic conditions and or our clients financial condition and which may have a negative impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the allowance for estimated policy cancellations on insurance brokerage business is established through a charge to revenue and the allowance for bad debts and policy cancellations and was million and million at december  and  respectively  due to growth in our revenues and receivables 
future additions to the allowances may be necessary based on changes in the trend of write offs or cancellations which could increase due to changes in economic conditions and or our clients financial condition 
we record fees and or commissions related to benefit enrollment services when earned 
we consider the earnings cycle complete when we have substantially completed our obligations under the service contract  we can reasonably estimate the revenue earned and when there is no significant collection risk 
at the completion of an enrollment we record an estimate of first year fee and or commission income less an estimate of policy cancellations 
this policy cancellation allowance is based on historical attrition rates by carrier and type of policy 
the allowance for policy cancellations on benefit enrollment services is established through a charge to revenue and receivables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
if our estimate of policy cancellations is too low  we may need to reverse previously recognized enrollment revenues 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and other long lived assets at least once a year or as required based on triggering events 
a triggering event is a change in business circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of goodwill is evaluated at the segment level using an analysis to determine the fair value of the segment using both market valuation data  such as recent transaction multiples of revenue or operating income  and present value techniques 
reviews for triggering events and impairment of other long lived assets are performed at the operating company level  one level below the segments  which is our determination of the lowest level of meaningful cash flows 
reviews for triggering events require the use of management s judgment 
upon identification of a triggering event  we perform further analysis using cash flow projections or other market valuation data to determine if the carrying value of an asset is impaired 
both methods require substantial judgment 
if  as a result of an impairment review  we find that the carrying value of an asset is in excess of the fair value  we would be required to take a charge against current earnings 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets exists  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
business acquisitions and purchase price allocations all of our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and the net assets and results of operations of the acquired companies were included in our financial statements on their respective acquisition dates 
frequently  acquisitions have provisions for a reduction in consideration if the acquired company does not meet targeted financial results 
additionally  the acquisitions frequently have provisions for contingent additional consideration if the acquired company achieves financial targets 
additional or reduced consideration related to acquisition contingency provisions is reflected as an adjustment to goodwill when the contingency is resolved 
we follow a consistent methodology based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows derived from acquired clients lists and attrition rates to estimate the fair value of the expiration rights and other intangible assets at the date of acquisition 
for acquisitions in excess of million in purchase price  we obtain an independent appraisal of the fair value of intangible assets acquired 
expiration rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated lives based on historical attrition 
non compete agreements and restrictive 
table of contents covenants are typically valued at an estimate of fair value using assumptions and projections assuming that no non compete agreement exists and that the covenanters actively pursued our clients or employees 
non compete agreements and restrictive covenants are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the agreements  which generally range from four to seven years 
both the allocation of purchase price and estimation of useful lives require management s judgment 
if historical fact patterns were to change  such as the rate of attrition of acquired client accounts  we may be required to allocate more purchase price to goodwill or accelerate the amortization of expiration rights  which may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill is not subject to amortization 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment 
gaap requires deferred tax assets and liabilities dtas and dtls  respectively to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carry forwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements 
for example  we have a dta because the tax bases of our accrued liabilities are smaller than their book bases 
similarly  we have a dtl because the book basis of our goodwill exceeds its tax basis 
carry forwards primarily include items such as net operating losses nols  which can be carried forward subject to certain limitations 
a summary of the significant dtas and dtls relating to our temporary differences and carry forwards is included in note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
at december   our current dtas total million  and our non current dtls total million 
we are required to reduce dtas but not dtls by a valuation allowance to the extent that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that any dtas will not be realized 
recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition was to occur 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management s judgment 
in making this judgment  management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the dtas will be realized 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we carried a valuation allowance for our net dta based on our history of net losses and the resulting uncertainty as to whether we would generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize our dta 
in the fourth quarter of  based on five consecutive quarters of profitability  our improved financial condition following our ipo  restructuring our credit facility and on forecasted future results  management determined that it was more likely than not that our dta would be realized in future periods  with the exception of dta related to state nol and tax credit carry forwards  therefore  we reversed the valuation allowance resulting in a deferred income tax benefit of million in in the event of adverse developments in our projections of taxable income  or if our estimates and assumptions were to change  management might be required to reach a different conclusion about the realization of our dta and re establish a valuation allowance through a charge to earnings 
litigation matters we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the normal course of business 
except as otherwise discussed in insurance industry investigations and other developments  we do not believe we are a party to any claims  lawsuits or legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
we have accrued a liability in accordance with gaap for our best estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of those claims where our liability is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with internal and external counsel that is handling our defense in these matters and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the establishment of reserves for claims and litigation requires management s judgment 
to the extent additional 
table of contents information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our estimate of our accrued liability in these matters may change  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period

we present organic revenue growth decline and believe it is relevant because it allows us to discern year over year growth in revenues related to the success or failure of our ability to execute on our sales and client retention strategies 
these financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that many analysts and investors regularly rely on non gaap financial measures to provide a financial measure by which to compare a company s assessment of its operating profitability against that of its peers 
we believe that investors use organic revenue growth decline to provide a financial measure by which to compare a company s internally generated as opposed to acquired revenue to that of its peers 
organic revenue growth decline may be helpful because it eliminates the impact of acquired revenue from total revenues 
this financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with gaap

common activities include combining offices and eliminating redundant positions 
many of these activities happen over time following the close of an acquisition and the related expense is recorded in compensation and other operating expenses as a part of our continuing operations and as a deduction in determining gaap net income 
for purposes of evaluating performance of our operating companies  these expenses are excluded from the calculation of operating income 
margin improvement plan in the fourth quarter of  we announced that our board of directors had approved a margin improvement plan in order to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
as a result of this action  we recorded expense of million for employee severance and related benefits for employees of million  facilities closures of million  the modification of sales professionals agreements of million and service contract termination fees of million 
in  we recorded an additional expense of million for employee severance and related benefits of million and the modification of sales professionals agreements of million 
while we are always focused on increasing margins  the margin improvement plan was unique in its magnitude and that it principally addressed legacy issues from prior acquisitions 
similar future expenses are likely to be prospective and related to new acquisitions and will be captured as integration costs 
while there can be no guarantee  we do not expect another margin improvement plan initiative similar in scope to the plan 
however  changes in economic circumstances  such as the loss of material revenues  could cause us to have to incur material similar expenses

table of contents early extinguishment of debt in august  we completed a million senior secured credit facility  further described below under liquidity and capital resources long term debt 
the proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility were drawn  in part  to repay all amounts under our previously existing credit facility 
as a result of repaying the previously existing credit facility  we recorded an expense of million as early extinguishment of debt to reflect the prepayment penalty and the write off of remaining deferred financing costs in the third quarter of we are currently in the process of refinancing and restructuring our credit facility 
if we are successful  we will be required to write off any deferred financing costs related to our current term loan 
at december   the balance in deferred financing costs was million liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations  including working capital needs  capital expenditures  debt service  acquisitions  other commitments and contractual obligations 
prior to our ipo  we relied on our ability to generate cash flows from our financing activities  such as the issuance of debt and equity  to supplement our cash flows from operations which were insufficient to fund our business operations 
following our ipo  we substantially reduced our long term debt  but still lacked sufficient cash flows from operations to fund our foreseeable required debt payments 
in we entered into a new credit facility  as further described below  and now consider our liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities 
when considering our liquidity  it is important to note that we hold cash in a fiduciary capacity as a result of premiums received from clients that have not yet been paid to insurance carriers 
the fiduciary cash is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet with a corresponding liability  net of commissions  to insurance carriers 
we earn interest on these funds during the time between receipt of the cash and payment to insurance carriers 
in some states  fiduciary cash must be kept in separate bank accounts subject to specific guidelines  which generally emphasize capital preservation and liquidity  and is not available to service debt or for other corporate purposes 
insurance brokerage transactions typically generate large cash flows  and the timing of such cash flows can significantly affect the net cash balances held at month end 
additionally  the seasonality of some of our businesses  particularly in the specialized benefits services segment  can create period to period fluctuations in our cash flows 
we believe that our projected cash flows generated from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand of million and our availability under our revolving credit facility of million as of december   should be sufficient to fund our estimated million in debt principal repayments  our working capital needs  acquisitions and budgeted million in capital expenditures through at least december  our liquidity thereafter will depend on our financial results  results of operations  acquisition activity and future available sources of additional equity or debt financing
