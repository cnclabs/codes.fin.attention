item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of modular classrooms in the state of california and a significant provider of commercial and light industrial modular buildings in california  nevada  arizona  new mexico  utah  colorado  texas  florida and other neighboring states 
we are expanding our classroom offerings in all locations in response to increasing demand for new classroom products 
key factors which impact demand for our products include a growing population and the resulting increase in school age children in the regions we serve  natural disasters such as the hurricanes in florida during and  a generally robust national economy and increased demand from military bases 
demand has increased significantly over the past two years with an increase of from to and an increase of from to despite these increases in demand  we incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flow during and beginning in  we focused on several initiatives to improve our performance  including strict inventory management and implementation of efficiency improvements in a concentrated effort to streamline our manufacturing operations and improve margins 
we also sought higher margin  less complex  permanent modular construction projects in order to reduce the risk of margin erosion associated with our field operations 
we were modestly successful in our turn around efforts in as our gross profit was million compared to a gross loss of million in a total of approximately million in change orders on the heritage high school project in northern california are included in both revenue and cost of sales for these change orders represent incremental work that was outside the original contract 
the contract calls for this work to be completed and the change orders submitted for approval and payment after the completion of the work 
we complied with this requirement 
although the change orders remain unapproved  we believe it is probable that these costs will be recovered 
we believe that in our recovery will extend beyond the turn around in gross margin as we continue the gains made in manufacturing and implement further improvements in our control of field operation costs 
we believe we have accounted for all the potential cost overruns in our backlog and that we will have positive operating income in in  we paid million in penalties and in fees for amendments to our credit facility that became necessary because of our failure to meet certain financial covenants 
in addition  million in accrued fees were added to the principal amount of our subordinated convertible note as a result of delays in registering the shares of common stock issued and to be issued upon conversion of the note 
the shares have been registered 
we do not believe we will incur these types of fees in results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of net sales represented by certain items in our statements of operations 
percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross loss profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain on sale of property and equipment covenant amortization loss income from operations interest expense  net loss on warrant and embedded derivatives other income loss income before income taxes income taxes benefit provision net loss income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales for the year ended december   increased by million  or approximately  when compared to the prior year 
when compared to the prior year  florida sales of million were up  texas sales of million were up  arizona sales of million were down and california sales of million were up 
the large increase in sales in florida was the result of continued growth in that state s school market and projects resulting from hurricane damage from storms in both and the growth in revenues from texas was due to dealer sales in the last three months of the year generated by reconstruction activity following hurricanes katrina and rita 
the increase in california sales was principally from classroom sales  including both relocatable and permanent modular construction  which increased to million when compared to the prior year 
this increase in net sales was due to the high backlog from being worked down in and returned to historical levels 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million over the gross loss of million recorded the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in up from a gross loss of in although gross profit in improved significantly over  it was below expectations because of three factors 
first  estimated cost overruns of million were charged to the campbell union elementary school district monroe middle school project in san jose  california during second  there were actual cost overruns totaling approximately million on three projects in florida during the year 
finally  approximately million in costs were incurred in closing two plants in california 
a number of issues plagued the campbell project  including a delay in approval of our plans by the california department of state architect 
disputes over the type of construction and project scope  combined with estimated cost increases due to the long delay between the awarding of the contract in late and the commencement of construction in the last week of december caused the projected cost overruns 
in accordance with aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts these estimated future cost overruns were recorded in even though most of the costs will be incurred in the project is scheduled to be completed in may in an effort to minimize cost overruns on the campbell project in  we have teamed with a major california construction management company to assist us in managing this project and as a pilot program to evaluate this potential change in project management structure for future large projects 
the disputes over the contract have led to litigation between modtech and the campbell school district  which is further described in item of this report 
completion of the first two story school project in florida resulted in actual cost overruns of approximately million 
the two story school project  which was bid in late  involved a new  complex product and suffered from manufacturing and field issues related to the complexity of the product 
the primary cause of the million in cost overruns on the other two projects was the completion of work in the field that should have been completed in the factory 
since these two projects were shipped  additional controls have been put in place at all of our factories to prevent the premature shipment of unfinished buildings 
management believes these controls have been effective in preventing further cost overruns of this type 
our facility in lathrop  california was closed in april  and subsequently subleased in september  closure of this facility resulted in approximately million of costs associated with turnover of the facility to the new tenant and the transfer of certain equipment to our primary perris  california factory 
at the end of december  we also closed a small factory in perris  california  keeping only a storage yard under lease 
the cost to transfer certain equipment to our primary perris  california factory was minimal  but the acceleration of deprecation on leasehold equipment and certain equipment totaled approximately million 
the closure of these two facilities will reduce future net lease costs by approximately million per year 
selling  general and administrative expense in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year to million with sg a costs representing of net sales compared to of net sales in the prior year 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs increased due to higher internal costs and costs associated with independent testing 
other incremental sg a costs were associated with higher volume 
goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the year ended december  because our fair value as determined by the december  closing stock price exceeded book value 
in the future  goodwill may be impaired by events or circumstances that lower the fair value below book value 
these events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  things such as continued operating losses  unanticipated competition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  or other factors leading to a decline in estimated future cash flows 
operating income loss operating losses decreased to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  from million in losses  or of net sales  for the year ended december  interest expense net interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase is attributable to higher interest rates and significantly greater borrowings under our credit facility due to our operating losses during also included in is the amortization of debt issuance costs of million and accretion of convertible debt discount in the amount of million 
in addition  million in penalties and waiver fees were incurred as a result of loan covenant violations and delays in registering the shares of common stock issued in connection with our convertible note 
the new credit facility with bank of america discussed below under liquidity in item will result in lower interest expense in due to the reduced debt and the lower interest rates of the facility 
income tax benefit no benefit for income tax was recorded in this compares to the benefit for income tax of million recorded for the year ended december  although we expect to return to profitability in  no tax benefit was recognized because under applicable accounting standards our cumulative losses for the three years ended december  are deemed to have created significant negative evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets 
therefore  a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which totals million at december   and million at december  our effective tax rate was before the deferred tax asset valuation adjustment compared to prior year at and is expected to remain approximately within this range for the lower effective tax rate in is due primarily to the million in non cash losses for the embedded and warrant derivatives  which are not deductible for tax purposes 
net income loss net loss increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the million in cost overruns on projects described above  million in debt service costs and million in non cash losses for the embedded and warrant derivative liabilities were the primary causes of the net loss in the non cash losses resulted primarily from the increase in our stock price during the period which caused a corresponding increase in the embedded and warrant derivative liabilities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   increased by million  or approximately  when compared to the prior year 
when compared to the prior year  florida sales of million were up  texas sales of million were up  arizona sales of million were up and california sales of million were up 
the significantly increased sales in florida were a result of the much anticipated school market opening up because of available state and local funding 
the increased sales in arizona were largely attributable to us military troop housing solutions as bases were reorganized 
general improvement in dealer sales also contributed to the sales increase across the company 
california classroom sales  including both relocatable and permanent modular construction declined to million when compared to the prior year 
this decline in net sales is due to timing of specific projects as the overall backlog of california classroom projects grew significantly during the year 
gross profit loss gross loss for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  from the million gross profit of the prior year 
gross loss as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to a gross profit of in the loss was due to several factors 
cost overruns of million were charged to the heritage high school project in brentwood  california 
four million dollars of these costs overruns resulted from events that occurred in and this portion of the cost overrun was identified by us prior to december  the remaining million in additional cost overruns was identified in april and may prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements 
these overruns are included in the results because they relate to certain contract conditions that existed as of december  and the subsequent information obtained during april and may allowed for the refinement of the loss estimate on this contract prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements 
this refinement was made pursuant to paragraph of the aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  which states that cost estimate refinements obtained subsequent to the balance sheet date should be included as an adjustment to the unissued financial statements 
the heritage project was substantially completed in the first week of june of the total million in cost overruns on the heritage project  approximately million was due to additional material  labor  project supervision and related costs 
the additional costs were caused by what we consider differences between the architect s plans and the specifications on which we bid the project 
approximately million of the heritage project cost overruns arose out of a dispute between us and the architect concerning the structural integrity of our welds as called for in the original scope of the project 
at the school district s insistence  the welds were tested in at a direct cost of approximately million 
the district delayed in approving the results of the test and a second test had to be conducted in the test results were approved by the school district and the structural integrity of the welds confirmed in late march the delay in approving the welds resulted in an accelerated timeline to complete the heritage project which  in turn  led to approximately million in additional costs 
the additional costs were primarily labor costs  including the subcontracting of additional laborers and overtime charges 
finally  approximately million of the heritage cost overruns were the result of correcting construction quality problems discovered during as a result of the inspection of the weld tests 
we have filed a lawsuit against the liberty union high school district for breach of contract to recover our losses on the heritage project 
see item legal proceedings 
inventory write downs accounted for approximately million of the gross margin erosion 
certain costs were associated with inventory that had been set aside for a specific project that was cancelled during the quarter ended september  it was also determined that the inventory would not be usable in a replacement project 
this inventory included steel and restricted use elevators that were not transferable to other projects 
other steel inventory was written down when it was determined after the quarterly inventory that the specific lengths and specifications were not usable 
another significant factor in the loss incurred during was the increased prices for commodities such as steel  lumber and plywood 
some steel components used in our products nearly doubled in price during and overall our steel costs were up in excess of 
selling  general and administrative expenses in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year with sg a costs representing of net sales compared to of net sales in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to costs of million associated with the senior management change that occurred in the quarter ended september   increased professional fees associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  professional and settlement fees associated with certain benefits plans and to increases attributable to higher sales activities across the company 
gain on sale of property and equipment we recognized a gain of  on the sale of property in florida in goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill recorded for the year ended december  because our fair value as determined by the december  closing stock price exceeded book value 
operating income loss operating losses of million  or of net sales  were incurred for the year ended december  compared to operating income of million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  interest expense in  net interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase is attributable to higher interest rates and a significantly greater borrowings under our credit facility due to our operating losses during also included in is the amortization of debt issuance costs of  as a result of the partial extinguishment of a prior credit facility at year end 
other income we recognized  of other income related to the settlement of a lawsuit we filed 
tax benefit the benefit for income tax of million for the year ended december  compares to a provision of million for the year ended december  minimal tax benefit was recognized because  under applicable accounting standards  our cumulative losses for the three years ended december  created significant negative evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets 
we therefore recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million 
our effective tax rate was before the deferred tax asset valuation adjustment compared to prior year at 
net income loss a net loss of million was incurred for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources in recent years we have funded our operations and capital expenditures mostly with cash generated internally by operations  borrowings under various credit facilities  cash received from exercised options and private placements of equity 
on february   we entered into a credit facility with fortress credit corp 
the credit facility  as administrative and collateral agent  and certain senior lenders as identified in the facility 
the credit facility provides million in revolving credit loans the revolving credit loan and a million term loan the term loan 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in december  we issued a million senior subordinated secured convertible note the note 
pursuant to the terms of the convertible note  million is cash collateralized 
on august   we issued  shares of common stock and warrants for an additional  shares of common stock in a private placement for an aggregate price of  in connection with the august  private placement  the note was amended and restated and its principal balance was increased by  as a result of accrued late penalties arising out of our failure to timely register the shares of common stock into which the note is convertible 
the revolving credit loan bears interest per annum  payable monthly  at a variable rate of to plus the greater of or jpmorgan chase bank s prime rate 
the term loan bears interest per annum  payable monthly  at the day libor rate plus a variable rate of to 
the variable rates depend on modtech s senior secured leverage ratio 
principal payments in the amount of million are due quarterly  with the first payment made on july  both loans mature and are due and payable on february  as of december  the applicable annual interest rates for the revolving credit loan  term loan and letter of credit subfacility were    respectively 
the note bears interest at per annum 
interest on the note is payable quarterly in cash 
the principal amount of the note is due on december  the note holder has the option to cause us to redeem up to million face amount of the note on june   million on june   and million on june  the face amount of million  or million net discounted value  is therefore classified as current as of december   as this portion may become due and payable within one year at the option of the note holder 
both the note and the credit facility contain certain financial convenants  primarily including meeting certain minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation requirements 
during the year ended december  we used cash of approximately million for operations 
during the year ended december  we used cash of approximately million for operations and for the year ended december  our operations provided cash in the amount of approximately million 
at december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and an additional million in restricted cash and working capital of million 
we had working capital of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
in  current assets increased by million over the prior year  with a decrease of million in cash and restricted cash and a decrease of million in income tax receivable offset by an increase of million in contracts receivable being the primary factors in the change 
accounts receivable increased primarily due to the higher revenues occurring during the fourth quarter of compared to  led by the increases in our texas operations 
current liabilities increased by million for when compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  including accruals for future loss on certain jobs of million  and a million increase in current debt compared to the prior year 
the increase in current debt resulted from the reclassification of million of term debt to current liabilities 
this reclassification occurred because operating losses recorded for the quarter ended december  caused us to be in default under the financial covenants of the debt 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in all three years  the majority of expenditures were a result of expanding production capacity at our various facilities 
we expect to expend approximately million in capital projects in we suffered a significant operating loss as well as negative operating cash flow in the latest fiscal year and continue to be subject to certain risks common to companies in our industry as further described in item a 
risk factors above 
our financial performance for the quarter ended december  resulted in the breach of certain financial covenants in our credit facility and in our note from a different lender  which included not meeting the minimum ebitda covenant requirement 
we have obtained a waiver of the breach from our subordinated lender 
we have not sought a waiver from the provider of our credit facility as this facility was replaced on march   as discussed below 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement the b of a credit facility with bank of america  n 
a and we amended our note again 
the b of a credit facility was funded and closed on april  we are in compliance with the financial covenants in both the amended note and the b of a credit facility 
in connection with the b of a credit facility  we terminated our credit facility with fortress credit corp 
on april   we paid off all amounts borrowed and due under the fortress credit facility  which aggregated approximately million  including approximately  in accrued interest 
there were no early termination penalties incurred by us in connection with the termination of the fortress credit facility 
the b of a credit facility provides for revolving credit loans of up to a maximum principal amount of  the revolver loans and a letter of credit subline in the maximum amount of  the revolver loans will bear interest per annum  payable monthly  at a variable rate equal to bank of america s announced prime rate  plus up to 
under certain circumstances  we may elect a libor rate plus to  in which case  interest will be payable in one  two  three or six month periods selected by us 
the variable rates  plus an unused credit line fee of between to per annum  will depend on our quarterly ebitda measured on a trailing month basis 
the principal amount of the revolver loans is due and payable in full on march  the revolver loans may be prepaid from time to time without penalty or premium  but if the b of a credit facility is terminated during the first two years  there is a termination fee equal to  in the first year and  in the second year 
the b of a credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
contractual obligations the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year amounts in thousands total thereafter debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations  nor do we have any other form of long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap that are not set forth in the preceding table 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense reported in the statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and continually evaluate our estimates and assumptions  nevertheless  estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results could significantly differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most significant accounting policies 
allowances for contract adjustments we maintain allowances for contract adjustments that result from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
management bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable  by account  at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accrual for worker s compensation reserve we are self insured for workers compensation under a high deductible program 
management bases its accrual estimate on input from the insurance carrier which includes information regarding open and closed cases  historical costs associated with those claims  certain developed costs and an estimate of incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
variation from the estimates of future liability claims is not only possible  but probable 
the inherent variability may result in actual costs being either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition on construction contracts contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
the percentage of completion methodology generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we attempt to reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to project delivery  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
our estimates of revenues and costs on construction contracts change periodically in the normal course of business due to factors such as productivity and modifications of contractual arrangements 
such changes are reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
valuation of the embedded and warrant derivatives the valuation of our embedded derivatives associated with our million convertible subordinated promissory note  and our warrant derivatives  associated principally with the  warrant shares issued in connection with our million private equity placement on august   are determined primarily by the black scholes option pricing model 
an embedded derivative is a derivative instrument that is embedded within another contract  which under the convertible note the host contract includes the right to convert the note by the holder  certain default redemption right premiums and a change of control premium payable in cash if a fundamental change occurs 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these embedded derivatives are marked to market each reporting period  with a corresponding non cash gain or loss charged to the current period 
a warrant derivative liability is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf 
based on eitf  warrants which are determined to be classified as derivative liabilities are marked to market each reporting period  with a corresponding non cash gain or loss charged to the current period 
the practical effect of this has been that when our stock price increases so does our derivative liability  resulting in a non cash loss charge that reduces our earnings and earnings per share 
when our stock price declines  we record a non cash gain  increasing our earnings and earnings per share 
to determine the fair value of our embedded derivatives  management evaluates assumptions regarding the probability of certain future events 
other factors used to determine fair value include our period end stock price  historical stock volatility  risk free interest rate and derivative term 
the fair value recorded for the derivative liability varies from period to period 
this variability may result in the actual derivative liability for a period either above or below the estimates recorded on our consolidated financial statements  resulting in significant fluctuations in other income expense because of the corresponding non cash gain or loss recorded 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires those items be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision to statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes apb no 
this statement addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first calendar quarter of  beginning january  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retrospective method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas r  however  we believe the adoption of sfas r may have a material effect on our financial results during the period of adoption 
we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and sfas no 
sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas sfas is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that adoption of this standard will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality historically  our quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
we have typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the increases in manufacturing output required by this seasonal demand 
our first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  our operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
we anticipate that the impact of seasonal demand for classrooms will diminish due to the growing impact of multi year contracts and increased sales outside the traditional classroom market 
however  these factors will not fully offset the impact of inclement weather and concentrations of holidays 
so although the impact of seasonal demand is expected to be diminished  revenue and margins in the first and fourth quarters will likely be lower than in the second and third quarters 
the following tables present our unaudited quarterly information for each quarter of fiscal years  and and reflects the seasonality of our business 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  which consist only of normal and recurring accruals  have been included to fairly present the unaudited quarterly results 
this data should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter net sales gross loss profit net loss income loss earnings per common share basic diluted net sales gross loss profit net loss income loss earnings per common share basic diluted net sales gross loss profit net loss income loss earnings per common share basic diluted inflation we are subject to the effects of changing prices 
during the years ended december  and december   there was no significant inflationary impact  but during we realized dramatic and unprecedented increases in the price of certain commodities used in the production of our products  in particular steel  dimensional lumber and plywood products 
many of our contracts at the time did not allow us to pass these costs on to our customers 
because of the pending reconstruction of the gulf coast region following hurricanes katrina and rita in  there is the potential for significant increases in the future cost of lumber and plywood products 
while the cost outlook for these and other commodities used in our production is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures with sales price adjustments that are allowed by our newer contracts and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts  including improved supply chain and inventory management item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or equity prices will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of instruments 
we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates on our current credit facility and the risk of loss on credit extended to our customers 
we have issued equity instruments  including warrants and a convertible note which contain certain derivatives which fluctuate  primarily as a result of changes in our stock price interest rate risk we are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates on our credit facilities 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk 
indebtedness under the senior credit facility we obtained in bears interest at libor plus additional interest of between and 
the additional interest charge is based upon certain financial ratios 
we estimate that the average amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility for will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of  for the year 
the interest rate on our convertible subordinated promissory note  is fixed 
credit risk our credit terms generally are net for dealer accounts and defined by contracts which vary for direct sales 
we actively monitor the risk of loss through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
historically  credit losses have been less than of sales and within our expectations 
derivative liability risk we are exposed to the risk of fair value derivative liability fluctuations in the equity instruments we have issued  which include a million convertible note and outstanding warrants 
the fair value of these derivative liabilities is primarily determined by fluctuations in our stock price 
as our stock price increases or decreases  the fair value of these derivative liabilities increase or decrease  resulting in a corresponding current period loss or gain to be recognized 
based on the balance on our convertible note  number of outstanding warrants  market interest rates and historical volatility of our stock price as of december   a increase or decrease in our stock price results in a non cash derivative loss or gain of approximately million 
during  we experienced a million non cash loss on warrant and embedded derivatives
