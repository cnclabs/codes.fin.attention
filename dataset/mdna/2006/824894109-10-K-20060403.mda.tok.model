overview shoe pavilion  inc is a leading independent off price branded footwear retailer in the western united states 
as of december   we operated stores in california  washington  oregon  arizona and nevada 
we were among the first footwear retailers on the west coast to expand the off price concept into the branded footwear market 
we offer a broad selection of quality designer label and branded footwear  typically at percent to percent below regular department store prices  in a convenient self service store format 
during  we opened retail stores and closed six retail stores 
we opened six stores and closed five in in  we opened four stores and closed seven 
we expect that the primary source of our future sales growth will be new store openings and to a lesser extent from an improvement in comparable store sales 
although comparable store sales have fluctuated the past several years  we believe we can achieve an improvement in comparable store sales by focusing on refining our sales efforts  including merchandise selection  advertising and promotions 
in late  we expanded our product line to include children s shoes and handbags 
in  we expanded our product line to include athletic accessories 
the addition of these categories contributed to the increase in comparable store sales in and we define comparable stores as those stores that have been open for at least consecutive months 
stores open less than consecutive months are treated as new stores  and stores closed during the period are excluded from comparable store sales 
our comparable store net sales increased in fiscal year  in fiscal year and decreased in fiscal year we do not allocate overhead  distribution costs  interest or taxes to stores 
the majority of the overhead costs  which consist of costs such as merchandising  accounting  information systems  rent and insurance  are shared expenses of our stores 
we seek to acquire footwear merchandise on favorable financing terms and in quantities large enough to support future growth 
this strategy causes an increase in inventory levels at various times throughout the year 
as a result  similar to other off price retailers  our inventory turnover rates are typically less than full price retailers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to our financial statements 
we believe that our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
we constantly reevaluate these accounting policies and estimates  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and our actual results have not differed materially from those determined by using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time the products are received by our customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for store sales at the point at which the customer receives and pays for the merchandise at the register with either cash or credit card 
for online sales  revenue is recognized at the time the customer receives the product 
customers typically receive goods within a few days of shipment 
amounts related to shipping costs billed to customers are reflected in net sales and the related costs are reflected in costs of sales 
discounts offered to customers consist primarily of point of sale markdowns and are recorded at the time of the related sale as a reduction of revenue 
gift certificates are carried as a liability when sold and revenue is recognized when the gift certificate is redeemed 
similarly  customers may receive a store credit in exchange for returned goods 
store credits are carried as a liability until redeemed 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns based on historical return trends 
at december  and january  the reserve was  and  respectively 
if actual returns are greater than those projected  additional sales returns reserves may be recorded in the future 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
we adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assure that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
the factors we consider include current sell through  seasonality and length of time held in inventory 
the amount ultimately realized from the sale of our inventory could differ materially from our estimates 
long lived assets in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of property and equipment  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows associated with stores and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
we believe at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of our property and equipment continue to be appropriate 
accrued workers compensation the company records an estimated liability for the self insured portion of the workers compensation claims based on historical experience and an evaluation of outstanding claims 
cost of sales cost of sales includes product costs  inbound freight  inventory shrinkage and store occupancy costs 
it does not include purchasing  warehousing  distribution costs and inter store freight transportation  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other retailers as some of these entities include purchasing  warehousing  distribution and inter store freight transportation expenses in cost of sales 
these expenses were approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
income taxes we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based upon our history of earnings  we believe that the realization of our deferred tax asset is more likely than not and therefore we have not provided a valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated  expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year net sales cost of sales and related occupancy expenses gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest expense other income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss december  fiscal year compared with january  fiscal year net sales net sales for increased percent to million compared to million for this increase in net sales in is primarily due to a increase in comparable store sales  increased sales of million generated from new stores opened in and increased sales of million due to relocating existing stores 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of million related to the closing of underperforming stores 
the increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the increase in the women s and men s categories and to a lesser degree from the children s category and other accessories category  which were added to the product line in gross profit cost of sales includes landed merchandise and occupancy costs 
gross profit for increased to million from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for increased to compared to for despite absorbing million of pre opening costs in the fourth quarter related to our new stores in dallas  texas  as a percentage of net sales  occupancy costs decreased by percentage points  which was partially offset by an increase in landed merchandise costs of of revenues 
selling expenses selling expenses in increased million  or  to million from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were of net sales in  compared with in the increased amount spent for selling expenses is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of million  advertising expenses of million  freight expenses of million and merchant fees for credit card sales of million 
advertising decreased to of net sales in compared to in  primarily due to a higher sales level in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate and administrative expenses  including payroll  store utilities  warehousing costs  professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase in was partially due to the relocation of our corporate offices to southern california 
we incurred moving expenses of million and increased rent expense of million 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses in was primarily due to increased utilities expenses of million due to higher energy costs  increased legal and accounting expenses of million and an increase in other miscellaneous expenses of million due to a higher level of overall business activity in interest expense interest expense increased million in due to higher average borrowings under our credit agreement and an increase in interest rates of during the year 
january  fiscal year compared with january  fiscal year net sales net sales for the fifty two weeks ended january  increased to million compared to million for the fifty three weeks ended january  fiscal year  which ended on january   had one additional week 
sales for this additional week were approximately million 
excluding this one additional week in fiscal year  the increase in net sales in fiscal year would have been 
this increase in net sales in fiscal year is primarily due to the increase in comparable store net sales and sales generated from six stores opened in  net of five closed 
the increase in comparable store sales was primarily driven by the increase in the women s category and to a lesser degree from the children s category which was added to our product line in late and other accessories added to the product line in these increases were partially offset by the decrease in comparable store sales in the men s category 
gross profit cost of sales includes landed merchandise and occupancy costs 
gross profit for increased to million from million in fiscal year gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year increased to compared to for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  the merchandising gross profit increased percentage points while the occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales  remained relatively unchanged 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is due in part to a higher average selling price and to a lesser degree a lower average unit cost 
the higher average selling price and the lower average cost increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by approximately and  respectively 
selling expenses selling expenses in fiscal year decreased by million or to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were compared with in fiscal year the decrease in selling expenses is primarily attributable to the reduction in advertising and worker s compensation costs 
advertising costs decreased by million in fiscal year advertising as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year in the third quarter of  we increased advertising 
the decrease in advertising is primarily attributable to the reduction in advertising in the third quarter of compared to although we believe that the higher amount spent on advertising in the third quarter of did contribute to the increase in comparable store net sales in the third quarter of  the increase was below our expectations 
because the expanded advertising did not produce the expected results in the third quarter of  we reduced our advertising in the third quarter of as we continued our focus on profitability 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate and administrative expenses  including payroll  store utilities  warehousing costs  professional fees and insurance 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded a reserve of million for costs associated with the settlement of a wage and hour lawsuit 
in the third quarter of  we reduced this reserve by approximately  as a result of final approval of the settlement by the court 
the recording of the million reserve in and the  reduction of this reserve in are the principal reasons for the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during the past three years 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not have such an effect in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
operating activities net cash provided by used in operating activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by operating activities in is primarily attributable to net income of million  increases in accrued expenses and deferred rent of million  and depreciation and amortization of million  partially offset by an increase in inventory of million and a reduction in accounts payable of million 
the increase in inventory as of december  is primarily attributable to the opening of ten stores in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily generated from a million reduction in inventory 
working capital at december  increased to million from million as of january  this increase was primarily due to using our net income  additional borrowings under our line of credit and the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock to open ten new stores 
by opening these stores  we increased our inventories and tenant improvement allowances receivable 
investing activities capital expenditures for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures for primarily related to leasehold improvements and fixtures and equipment of approximately million for new stores  the remodeling and upgrade of stores of approximately million  the relocation of two stores of approximately million and million for relocation of our corporate offices 
expenditures for were primarily for leasehold improvements and fixtures for the six stores we opened 
expenditures for were primarily for the remodel of four stores  million were for leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment for four new stores and million were for leasehold improvements for the build out of the new corporate office 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for will be approximately million  net of lease incentives 
the actual amount of capital expenditures will depend in part upon the number of stores opened in and the lease incentives received from landlords 
the number of stores ultimately opened is in part dependent upon the availability of desirable locations and management s ability to negotiate acceptable lease terms 
financing activities cash provided by used in financing activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities in primarily relates to the net increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock and common stock warrants and the exercise of stock options 
the cash provided by financing activities in relates to the net increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the cash used by financing activities in relates to the repayment of loans under our revolving credit facility primarily driven by the reduction of inventory by million in revolving credit facility we maintain a revolving credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc that provides for borrowings of up to million  including a million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
under the terms of this revolving credit facility during  we were subject to a capital expenditures limit of million  of which million was designated for capitalized leases 
in each remaining year of the revolving credit facility  wells fargo has indicated that it will adjust our capital expenditure limit based upon our business plan 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are based upon a percentage of eligible inventory less certain reserves 
borrowings are secured by inventory  equipment  general intangibles and other rights to payments 
the revolving credit facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends and contains various restrictive covenants 
in march  we entered into amendment number four to our revolving credit facility  which extends the term of the revolving credit facility from july  to april   provides for a maximum borrowing amount of million 
this amount may be increased at our option up to a maximum of million  so long as no event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result therefrom and upon payment of a fee of of the amount by which the company requests that the credit facility be increased 
the minimum available reserve that must be maintained under the revolving credit facility is times the maximum borrowing amount then in effect 
amendment number four provides for an increase of the annual capital expenditures limit from million to million  in addition to the existing limit of million for capital lease obligations  provided  however  that wells fargo may increase or decrease the capital expenditures amount based upon our annual projections 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including a limitation on capital expenditures 
the revolving credit facility does not contain any restrictions on disposal of assets or closure of stores other than a restriction prohibiting us from taking action to convey  sell  lease  license  assign  transfer or otherwise dispose of  in one transaction or a series of transactions  all or substantially all of our assets 
the revolving credit facility restricts us from incurring additional indebtedness  except to the extent provided in the credit agreement  from consigning any of our inventories to third parties under a bill and hold  sale or return  sale on approval or other conditional terms of sales and from making any distribution  declaration or payment of any dividend in cash or other property  other than common stock 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus to  depending on our trailing twelve month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at december  was 
as of december   approximately million was available for advances under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with the loan covenants of our revolving credit facility 
although the revolving credit facility expires in april and we have the intent and ability to maintain this debt outstanding for more than one year  we have classified our borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a current liability in accordance with the provisions set forth in emerging issues task force eitf balance sheet classifications  borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
stock offerings public offering of common stock on march   we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering at per share 
in addition to the common stock sold by us   shares of common stock held by our chief executive officer the selling stockholder were sold in the offering 
our underwriters also have the option for days following the offering date to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock from the selling stockholder to cover over allotments of shares 
in connection with the offering  we will also issue to one of our underwriters warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we intend to use the estimated proceeds received from the offering of million  net of underwriting discounts and direct offering costs  to open new stores and for working capital 
pending the application of the proceeds  we intend to pay down the balance under our revolving credit facility and invest any remaining amounts in short term investments 
we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock shares by the selling stockholder 
series a convertible preferred stock financing on october   we entered into a securities purchase agreement under which we issued and sold to an investor in a private placement  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock the preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to of the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the preferred stock  for a purchase price of million 
the shares of preferred stock were converted by the investor into an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share in january the warrants entitle the investor to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
of this total   warrants are exercisable at per share and  warrants are exercisable at per share 
the warrants expire on october  the funds received from this transaction are being used for general working capital purposes 
contractual and commercial obligations the following summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period less than to to more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases      capital leases revolving credit facility   documentary and stand by letters of credit   purchase obligations for inventory   service contracts total contractual obligations  as part of our store operating leases  we are responsible for other costs including insurance  taxes  promotional costs and common area and maintenance costs 
these costs have not been included in the total obligations under operating leases 
as a percentage of net sales  these costs were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
includes imputed interest of 
represents outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december  although such amounts are not required to be repaid until july   the end of the commitment for the facility  these amounts were repaid in march service contracts relate to annual maintenance and software support on our computer system 
we currently expect that anticipated cash flows from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the net proceeds from our recent common stock offering will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
our capital requirements may vary significantly from anticipated needs  depending upon such factors as operating results and the number and timing of new store openings 
if our expenses or capital requirements increase materially or if our cash flows from operations are materially lower than expected  we may need to seek additional financing  which may not be available on attractive terms or at all 
see item a 
risk factors for a description of certain factors that may impact our expenses  capital requirements and cash flows from operations

we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates

foreign currency risks we did not have any foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  or january  we make minimal purchases outside of the united states that involve foreign currencies and  therefore  have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
we do not typically hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is insignificant
