item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an insurance holding company engaged in underwriting  servicing and distributing non standard personal automobile insurance policies and related products and services to individual consumers in highly targeted geographic areas 
our subsidiaries include two insurance companies  four underwriting agencies  five retail agencies with owned and franchise retail store locations as of december  as of the date of this filing  we offer our products and services in states  including texas  illinois  california and florida 
we were formerly known as instant insurance holdings  inc  and we incorporated in delaware on june  we have restated our audited consolidated financial statements and our quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of operations 
the restated consolidated financial statements conform to the current presentation and reflect the correction of an error in the application of consolidating elimination entries 
see note restatement to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the restated amounts 
the restatement has no impact on previously reported net income  earnings per share or shareholders equity 
on june   we purchased  of our shares of common stock from vesta at a price of per share 
on june   vesta entered into a stock purchase agreement with new affirmative llc  for the sale of  shares of our common stock 
new affirmative was formed for the purpose of acquiring  holding  voting and disposing of the shares of our common stock acquired in connection with the stock purchase agreement and any shares of our common stock that new affirmative may acquire in the future 
new affirmative is i owned by dsc affm  llc  an entity controlled by dsc affm manager llc  the sole managing member of dsc affm  and andrew g 
bluhm  the managing member of dsc affm manager  and ii owned by affirmative investment llc  an entity owned  in part  by the enstar group  inc  and controlled by affirmative associates llc  the sole managing member of affirmative investment and j 
christopher flowers  the sole member and manager of affirmative associates 
simultaneously with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement dsc affm contributed  shares of the company s common stock which were previously acquired in open market transactions by members of dsc affm and subsequently contributed to dsc affm  to new affirmative and affirmative investment contributed  shares of the company s common stock  previously acquired by it in open market transactions  to new affirmative 
the vesta new affirmative transaction was subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval by the illinois department of financial and professional regulation division of insurance and other required filings 
vesta completed the sale to new affirmative on august  new affirmative now owns  shares of our common stock  or approximately 
our insurance companies  underwriting agencies and retail agencies often function as a vertically integrated unit  capturing the premium and associated risk and commission and fee revenue generated from the sale of each insurance policy 
however  each of these operations also works with unaffiliated entities on an unbundled basis  either functioning independently or with one or both of the other two operations 
we believe that our ability to enter into a variety of business relationships with third parties allows us to maximize sales penetration and profitability through industry cycles better than if we employed a single  vertically integrated operating structure 

table of contents historically  we have measured the total premiums written from which we derive commissions by our underwriting agencies or premiums by our insurance companies as our total controlled premium 
total controlled premium differs from gross written premiums in that total controlled premium includes all business produced by our agencies  both affiliated and unaffiliated  whereas gross written premium includes only business that is written or assumed by our insurance companies 
total controlled premium has been an important measure of our performance in the past because we were not retaining of the business produced by our agencies  but our agencies earned commissions and fee based revenues on the business that we did not retain 
since we currently retain most of the business written by our agencies  gross written premium has become a more meaningful measure of our performance 
when cancellations occur  total controlled premium is reduced by of the cancellation since it reflects of the business 
however  gross written premiums are reduced only by the portion of the cancellations that pertain to the retained business 
therefore  current year cancellations of premiums produced in the prior year on those programs that are currently less than retained by our insurance companies will reduce total controlled premium by the total cancellation whereas gross written premium will only be reduced by the retained portion 
when we retain of premiums written for consecutive years  total controlled premium and gross written premium are the same 
the following table displays our total controlled premium and gross premiums written by distribution channel for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands total controlled gross premiums premium written our underwriting agencies our retail stores independent agencies subtotal unaffiliated underwriting agencies other total of the million that was written or assumed by our insurance companies  million was written by old american county mutual fire insurance company  an unaffiliated texas county mutual insurer  but assumed by our insurance companies 
total controlled premium for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the same period in in our retail distribution channel  total controlled premium decreased million  or  to million  as compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to decreases in our texas and midwest markets due to increased advertising competition  partially offset by acquisitions of retail stores in florida and texas markets 
in our independent agency distribution channel  total controlled premium decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in  due to decreases in our florida underwriting agency as a result of continued competition and planned reductions in the amount of business that we write in miami dade county  as well as reduced production in our texas and midwest underwriting agencies 
these decreases are partially offset by production in our michigan operation  which was acquired july  in our new mexico underwriting agencies due to an acquisition in july  and in our south carolina underwriting agencies 
total controlled premium from unaffiliated underwriting agencies decreased by million  or  to million compared to million for the same period last year  primarily due to run off of two of our programs in california  and programs in alabama  georgia and utah 
the unaffiliated underwriting agencies we contract with in alabama  georgia and utah received regulatory approval for licensing of their insurance companies from these states and are transitioning policies to their own insurance companies 
gross written premium for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or as compared to million for the same period in in our retail distribution channel  gross written premium of million increased million  or  as compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to increased retention in our insurance companies and new retail stores 
in our independent agency distribution channel  gross written premium was million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the same period in  principally due to increased retention in our insurance companies 
gross written premium for our unaffiliated agencies was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to run off of two of our programs in california  and programs in alabama  georgia and utah  as described above 
note on insurance company segment effective december   vesta sold to us two insurance companies affirmative insurance company and insura and also transferred to us all future economic interest in vesta s non standard personal automobile insurance business through a series of reinsurance transactions 
we accounted for our acquisition of these insurance companies at their underlying carrying amounts in a manner similar to a pooling of interests in accordance with sfas no 
 and our historical consolidated financial statements have been presented to reflect our historical results of operations and the historical results of affirmative insurance company and insura on a 
table of contents combined basis 
prior to december   our insurance companies ceded of their premiums  losses and loss adjustment expenses to vesta fire 
accordingly  our insurance companies historical statements of operations prior to january  do not include any of the premiums  losses or loss adjustment expenses on policies written by our insurance companies 
discussion and analysis provided the historical financial results of vesta s non standard personal automobile insurance business for the years ended december  have been included in footnotes to vesta s audited financial statements  which are not included in this report 
significant events impacting financial statement comparability change in management 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed separation and non competition agreements with three former executives that resulted in materially increased costs relative to previous periods 
the expenses incurred in connection with this change in management in the fourth quarter of were million  including million in severance   in amortization related to non competition agreements  and  incurred for a retained search for a replacement executive 
vesta s ownership 
on december   vesta acquired common and convertible preferred stock representing approximately of our voting stock on a fully diluted basis 
on december   vesta acquired additional common and convertible preferred stock representing an additional approximately of our voting stock 
when purchase transactions result in an entity becoming wholly owned or majority owned  a new basis for the purchased assets and liabilities must be presented  representing the concept of push down accounting 
we determined that vesta s costs of acquiring us should be pushed down in order to establish a new accounting basis in our separate financial statements 
in recognition of vesta s approximately ownership position in us  we adopted push down accounting to reflect vesta s cost basis in us effective december  the principal adjustments that were made to adopt push down accounting were to record goodwill of million and to adjust the various elements of stockholders equity  including retained deficit  related to vesta s ownership percentage 
acquisitions 
in   and  we acquired seven retail and or underwriting agencies currently operating in seven states 
effective december   we acquired our two insurance companies from vesta 
descriptions of each of these acquisitions are provided below 
with the exception of the december  insureone transaction and the acquisition of our insurance companies  all of these transactions were accounted for as purchases and the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased based on their fair values at the time of acquisition 
space coast 
on october  we purchased a ownership interest in space coast holdings  inc  the parent company of space coast underwriters insurance agency  inc  a florida based underwriting agency 
at the time of our acquisition  the remaining ownership of space coast was held by the management of space coast 
following the transaction  the management of space coast exercised options and increased its ownership percentage to  with our ownership percentage decreasing to 
however  in march  we completed the acquisition of the minority ownership interest of space coast

on december   we acquired from vesta substantially all of the business and operations comprising insureone  a chicago based retail agency and underwriting agency 
the acquisition included an equity interest in the retail agency 
vesta had purchased the assets of these businesses from an unaffiliated third party on january  we accounted for these acquisitions at vesta s historical carrying amounts as transfers of net assets between entities under common control in accordance with sfas no 
the transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  therefore  our historical financial statements have been presented to reflect our results of operations with those of the insureone underwriting and retail businesses on a combined basis effective january  on may   we acquired from an unrelated third party the minority interest in insureone s retail agency that we did not already own 
we accounted for this acquisition as a purchase and accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased based upon their fair values at the time of acquisition 
affirmative insurance company and insura 
effective december   we acquired affirmative insurance company and insura from vesta 
we accounted for our acquisition of the insurance companies at vesta s historical carrying amounts as transfers of net assets between entities under common control in accordance with sfas no 
the acquisitions were accounted for as a pooling of interests  and all historical financial statements presented reflect our results of operations on a combined basis with those of affirmative insurance company and insura 
fed usa 
in december  we acquired certain assets of fed usa retail  inc  which owns retail agencies that produce and service non standard personal automobile policies sold in florida by owned and branded retail stores in three dmas as of december  we also acquired certain assets of fed usa franchising  inc  which produces and services policies sold in florida through franchised retail stores in four dmas as of december  
table of contents ipa 
on july   we acquired the assets of ipa  llc  an underwriting agency with operations in michigan 
ipa generates approximately million in premiums annually 
reinsurance transaction with vesta 
effective december   vesta restructured its internal reinsurance arrangements relating to non standard personal automobile insurance policies to transfer to our insurance companies all of the future economic interest in vesta s non standard personal automobile insurance business 
under this transaction  which was effected through a quota share reinsurance agreement  vesta fire retained all loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of december  related to these policies and remains liable to indemnify us for any losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses associated with these policies that occurred on or prior to december  vesta s non standard personal automobile insurance business had net premiums earned of million for the year ended december  we determined that this restructuring of vesta s internal reinsurance did not constitute a business combination within the meaning of sfas no 
and  accordingly  our historical consolidated statements of operations included in this report do not reflect any underwriting results on these policies during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make estimates and assumptions that can significantly affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and therefore impact amounts reported in the future 
we believe the following are some of the areas where the degree of judgment in determining amounts recorded in our historical consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical revenue recognition  accounting and reporting for reinsurance  recoverability of assets  reserving for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  statutory accounting practices  valuation of investments  and accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition 
our consolidated revenues are derived principally from premiums  commissions  fees  investment income and investment gains and losses 
premiums are earned over the life of a policy on a pro rata basis 
unearned premiums represent that portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
premium receivables are recorded net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
we receive commissions for policies that are written through our underwriting agencies or are sold by our retail agencies 
these policies are subject to cancellation by the policyholder prior to the policy expiration date 
we estimate the future cancellations in determining the amount of commission and fee income that is recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
our allowance for policy cancellations  presented as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet  is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary 
all commission and policy fee revenue and our related allowance for policy cancellations from our insurance companies are eliminated in consolidation 
the commission rate paid to our underwriting agencies is established annually in contractual agreements between our underwriting agencies and our insurance companies and the unaffiliated insurance company our underwriting agencies represent 
provisional commissions are paid to our underwriting agencies based upon a contractually established provisional commission rate multiplied by the premiums that they produce 
our underwriting agencies also can earn profit sharing commissions from our insurance companies and the unaffiliated insurance company they represent if the loss ratio on the business they produce is lower than a contractually established provisional loss ratio 
profit sharing is recorded when we conclude it is probable that estimates of losses will result in loss ratios that are lower than the provisional loss ratios 
these loss ratio estimates are based on various actuarial assumptions and determinations by our internal actuaries regarding potential future losses 
if the actual loss experience is less favorable than the estimates used  income may be reduced in subsequent periods 
fee income includes policy origination fees and installment fees to compensate us for the costs of providing installment payment plans  as well as late payment  policy cancellation  policy rewrite and reinstatement fees 
we recognize policy origination fees over the premium earning period of the underlying policies and recognize all other fees on a collected basis 
claims processing fees are received from insurance companies over the premium earning period of the underlying policies 
these fees are recognized as revenue over the expected period during which processing services are performed and in amounts appropriate to the processing effort and related costs 
the service period and related revenues are based upon historical and expected claims settlement data 
all claims processing fees from our insurance companies are eliminated in consolidation 
accounting and reporting for reinsurance 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts  we are required to review the contractual terms of all our reinsurance purchases to ensure compliance with that statement 
the statement establishes the conditions required for a contract with a reinsurer to be accounted for as reinsurance and prescribes accounting and reporting standards for those contracts 
for all reinsurance transactions  immediate recognition of gains is precluded unless our liability to our policyholders is extinguished 
contracts that do not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss from the insurance risk assumed generally do not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and must be accounted for as deposits 

table of contents sfas no 
also requires us to disclose the nature  purpose and effect of reinsurance transactions  including the premium amounts associated with reinsurance assumed and ceded 
it also requires disclosure of concentrations of credit risk associated with reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums 
we believe we have properly accounted for all of our reinsurance contracts 
recoverability of assets 
our financial statements include as assets amounts we either expect to collect from third parties  particularly reinsurance recoverables  or expect to benefit from in future periods  particularly deferred acquisition costs 
in establishing these amounts  we have made significant judgments and estimates regarding the ultimate realization of each asset 
specifically  we have made critical assumptions and judgments in establishing assets for reinsurance recoverables on paid losses and deferred policy acquisition costs 
changes in assumptions  judgments or estimates we have made with respect to each of these assets would directly impact our financial results and financial condition 
reinsurance recoverable on paid and incurred losses 
we cede premiums and losses to reinsurers under quota share reinsurance agreements 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage which it assumes  our reinsurance contracts do not discharge our insurance companies from primary liability to each policyholder for the full amount of the applicable policy 
consequently our insurance companies remain obligated to pay claims in accordance with the terms of the policies regardless of whether a reinsurer fulfills or defaults on its obligations under the related reinsurance agreement 
when we determine that a claim for loss and other costs associated with the loss made under one of our insurance policies is owed  we initially pay the full amount owed to the insured or claimant 
subsequently  we seek to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contract 
we record the amounts we expect to receive from reinsurers pursuant to these contracts as assets on our balance sheet 
our insurance companies report as assets the estimated reinsurance recoverable on paid losses and unpaid losses  including an estimate for losses incurred but not reported  and premium amounts paid to reinsurers applicable to unexpired terms of policies in force 
these amounts are estimated based on our interpretation of each reinsurer s obligations pursuant to the individual reinsurance contracts between us and each reinsurer  as well as judgments we make regarding the financial viability of each reinsurer and its ability to pay us what is owed under the reinsurance contract 
in evaluating the financial viability of each reinsurer  we rely upon financial statements  credit reports and other publicly available information applicable to each reinsurer  as well as management s experience and industry knowledge 
at december   we had million receivables from reinsurers  including million gross recoverable from vesta fire 
vesta fire is currently rated c marginal by am best 
according to our reinsurance agreement  if vesta fire s am best financial strength rating remains below b we have the right to require vesta fire to provide a letter of credit or establish a trust account to collateralize the gross amounts due to us from vesta fire under the reinsurance agreement 
on july   we notified vesta to establish a trust account collateralizing the amount due to us  due to the fact that vesta fire s am best rating was below a b after the consummation of our initial public offering 
we have million currently in a trust account to collateralize the million gross recoverable from vesta fire 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that we incur acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
policy acquisition costs  primarily commissions and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing a policy are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related policies 
at december   we had million of deferred policy acquisition costs 
management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset 
a premium deficiency and a corresponding charge to income is recognized if the sum of the expected losses and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and anticipated investment income 
at december   we determined that there was no premium deficiency 
reserving for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we maintain reserves in the amount of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to incurred claims and our estimate of unreported claims 
management s estimation of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on projections developed by our actuaries using analytical methodology commonly used in the property casualty insurance industry 
the liabilities stated for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based on the following the accumulation of estimates of individual claims for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period  estimates received from ceding companies  reinsurers and insurance pools and associations  estimates of unreported losses based on past experience  estimates based on past experience of expenses for investigating and adjusting claims  and estimates of subrogation and salvage collections 
we periodically adjust our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for changes in product mix  underwriting standards  loss cost trends and other factors 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves may also be impacted by factors such as the rate of inflation  claims settlement patterns  litigation and legislative activities 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses have not been reduced for our reinsurance recoverables 
changes in estimates of the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which determined 
ultimately  our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
as previously noted  our financial statements for periods before december  include the effects of a quota share reinsurance contract with our affiliate  vesta fire 
accordingly  we retain none of the underwriting risks associated with the reserves established at december  for our insurance companies 
our losses  loss adjustment expense reserves and deposit liabilities were million on a gross basis and million on a net basis  which were our best estimates as of december  the analysis provided by our independent opining actuaries  as of december   indicated that the expected range for the ultimate liability for our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves was between million and million on a gross basis and between million and million on a net basis 
statutory accounting practices 
the company is required to report its results of operations and financial position to insurance departments of insurance based upon statutory accounting practices sap 
certain key differences under sap  unlike gaap are as follows the company is required to expense all sales and other policy acquisition costs as they are incurred rather than capitalizing and amortizing them over the expected life of the policy 
the immediate charge off of sales and acquisition expenses and other conservative valuations under sap generally cause a lag between the sale of a policy and the emergence of reported earnings 
because this lag can 
table of contents reduce the company s gain from operations on a sap basis  it can have the effect of reducing the amount of funds available for dividend from insurance companies 
valuation of investments 
our investments are recorded at fair value and are typically based on publicly available quoted prices 
from time to time  the carrying value of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of the inherent volatility of publicly traded investments 
we do not adjust the carrying value of any investment unless management determines that its value is other than temporarily impaired 
we conduct regular reviews to assess whether the amortized cost of our investments are impaired and if any impairment is other than temporary 
factors considered by us in assessing whether an impairment is other than temporary include the credit quality of the investment  the duration of the impairment  our ability and intent to hold the investment until recovery and overall economic conditions 
if we determine that the value of any investment is other than temporarily impaired  we record a charge against earnings in the amount of the impairment 
our investment committee reviewed our investment portfolio in december and decided to sell a portion of our investment portfolio in order to better align our portfolio with our historical claims life 
specifically  the investment committee determined that all securities with a maturity after december  should be sold 
we determined that the identified securities to be sold would not fully recover fair market value would not equal or exceed amortized cost prior to the expected sale date  therefore the securities were deemed other than temporarily impaired in december when the decision to sell was made and we recorded a charge to earnings of million in the fourth quarter of the identified securities were in compliance with our investment guidelines prior to the realignment decision by the investment committee 
the following table shows our investments with gross unrealized losses after giving effect to the million charge in december and fair value  aggregated by type of fixed maturity investment and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at december  dollars in thousands less than twelve months over twelve months total gross gross gross unrealized fair unrealized fair unrealized fair losses value losses value losses value us government and agencies mortgage backed municipal corporate and other total investments accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  with the exception of our acquisitions of our insurance companies and insureone from vesta  both of which were accounted for as a pooling of interests  we have accounted for all of our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
in acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price for the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated values 
the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is an asset referred to as goodwill 
indirect and general expenses related to business combinations are expensed as incurred 
principally  all of our goodwill and intangible assets relate to our agency acquisitions 
our insurance company segment has no material associated goodwill or intangible assets 
we test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we test for impairment based upon the following the historical financial performance of the unit  the most recent financial performance of the unit  management s financial forecast for the unit  information regarding publicly available financial terms of recent transactions in the insurance industry  and other publicly available information 
we perform impairment tests annually on september the test performed as of september  indicated there was no goodwill or indefinite life intangible asset impairment 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are periodically reviewed to ensure that no conditions exist indicating the recorded amount of finite life intangible assets is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
as of december   we have recorded in our financial statements million of goodwill  million of indefinite life intangible assets and million of finite life intangible assets having estimated lives of between two and years 
segment reporting overview 
as described in more detail below  our agency segment is comprised of our underwriting agencies and our retail agencies 
our underwriting agencies primarily design  distribute and service policies issued or reinsured by our insurance companies or another unaffiliated insurance company 
in our insurance segment  we issue non standard personal automobile insurance policies through our two illinois domiciled insurance company subsidiaries 
our insurance companies possess the certificates of authority and capital necessary to transact insurance business and issue policies  but they rely on both affiliated and unaffiliated underwriting agencies to design  distribute and service those policies 

table of contents for presentation in the consolidated financial statements  we combine several of the line items disclosed in more detail in the segment information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revenue line item commission income and fees on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the combination of the following segment line items a commission income  b fee income and c claims processing fees 
the expense line item selling  general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations consists of the combination of the following three segment line items a policy acquisition expenses  b employee compensation and benefits and c operating expenses 
agency segment 
our agency segment is comprised of our underwriting agencies and our retail agencies 
our underwriting agencies primarily design  distribute and service policies that are issued or reinsured by our insurance companies 
our retail agencies primarily sell non standard personal automobile insurance policies that are issued or reinsured by our insurance companies and administered by our underwriting agencies 
however  both our underwriting agencies and retail agencies do business with unaffiliated third parties 
during  our underwriting agencies also administered the nonstandard personal automobile insurance policies of one unaffiliated insurance company 
our underwriting agencies appoint both unaffiliated independent agencies and our retail agencies to distribute insurance policies to individual customers 
in the year ended december   our underwriting agencies were responsible for a total of million of gross premiums written  million  or  of which were distributed through independent agencies  and million  or  of which were distributed through our retail agencies 
our retail agencies earn commissions and fees from the sale of non standard personal automobile insurance policies administered by our underwriting agencies  which are substantially eliminated in consolidation  as well as commissions and fees from the sale of other insurance policies and products of unaffiliated companies 
for the year ended december   the total commissions and fees earned by our retail agencies were million  of which approximately million  or  was paid to us by unaffiliated companies and not eliminated in consolidation 
the revenues of our agency segment are derived principally from commissions generated by our underwriting agencies from designing  distributing  servicing and selling insurance policies issued or reinsured by our insurance companies and by unaffiliated insurance companies  commissions generated by our retail agencies from selling insurance policies issued by unaffiliated insurance companies  policy acquisition fees  installment and late payment fees  and fees from the sale of ancillary products  and claims processing fees paid to our underwriting agencies for the administration of claims for policies issued or reinsured by our insurance companies and by an unaffiliated insurance company 
our underwriting and retail agencies have substantial fixed cost components to their operating structures enabling them to significantly increase premium volume while only marginally increasing operating expenses 
the principal operating expenses of our underwriting and retail agencies include salary expense  lease payments  commissions our underwriting agencies pay to unaffiliated independent agencies  and other costs of producing and administering business  including advertising costs  the costs of administering policies and the costs of claims administration 
insurance company segment 
the historical financial results of our insurance companies prior to only included certain revenues  primarily policy fees  that were not ceded to vesta fire 
beginning january   our revenues also include premiums and investment income and our expenses also include losses and loss adjustment expenses 
therefore  beginning january   the financial results of our insurance companies are primarily dependent on the amount of premiums we collect  which is dependent on rate  volume and retention levels  the investment income we earn by collecting and investing premiums in advance of paying claims  as well as the investment income we earn on investments related to the statutory surplus that we maintain in our insurance companies to support the premiums that we underwrite  the losses and other costs we incur to adjust and pay claims submitted by individuals we have insured  the cost of reinsurance programs  and the expenses we incur for policy acquisition and to operate our insurance companies 
we issue non standard personal automobile insurance policies through affirmative insurance company and insura  our two illinois domiciled insurance company subsidiaries 
our insurance companies are licensed to write business in states  although our business is concentrated in states 
our insurance companies possess the certificates of authority and capital necessary to transact insurance business and issue policies  but they rely on both our underwriting agencies and unaffiliated underwriting agencies to design  distribute and service those policies 
subject to regulatory approval  premium rates are generally within our control and we continuously monitor and seek to adjust rates as appropriate 
with respect to volume  our ability to increase the amount of written premium retained by our insurance companies is largely dependent on the statutory leverage of our insurance companies  generally expressed as the amount of net written premiums relative to statutory surplus 
statutory surplus is defined as total assets less total liabilities of our insurance companies in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
we operate with a limited amount of statutory surplus and as a result may utilize reinsurance to maintain our statutory leverage at a level we believe is acceptable 

table of contents for the year ended december   our insurance companies revenues consisted primarily of policy fees  comprised primarily of origination and installment fees charged to our policyholders  and a small amount of investment income earned on invested assets and realized gains and losses 
beginning january   our insurance companies revenues include net premiums earned  which is the sum of the premiums earned on direct and assumed premiums written less premiums earned on premiums we cede to reinsurers  net investment income we earn on our invested assets  together with realized gains and losses on our investments  and policy fee revenues  which are comprised primarily of origination and installment fees charged to our policyholders 
for the year ended december   our insurance companies expenses consisted primarily of policy acquisition expenses  less ceding commissions that we received under reinsurance contracts  and a small amount of operating and general expenses 
because our insurance companies received ceding commissions from vesta fire that exceeded their policy acquisition expenses  our insurance company segment reported negative expenses during the year ended december  beginning january   our insurance companies expenses include losses and loss adjustment expenses  including estimates for losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred during a period and the changes in estimates for prior periods  less the portion of those losses and loss adjustment expenses that we cede to reinsurers  policy acquisition fees  including commissions and fees paid to our underwriting agencies and unaffiliated underwriting agencies and premium taxes  less ceding commissions that we receive under reinsurance contracts  and operating and general expenses  which include general and administrative expenses and other expenses 
the majority of these expenses are variable 
changes in expenses are closely correlated with changes in premium volume 
commission expenses and claims administration expenses are determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned according to contractual agreements with individual underwriting agencies 
corporate and other 
the financial results of our corporate and other segment reflect other revenue and expenses that are not allocated to any particular segment  including investment income and investment gains and losses on investments held at the holding company level  corporate interest expense  and general corporate overhead expenses 
results of operations we have restated our audited consolidated financial statements and our quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of operations 
the restated consolidated financial statements conform to the current presentation 
see note restatement to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of previously reported amounts to the restated amounts 
the restatement of the audited financial statements has no impact on previously reported net income  earnings per share  invested assets or shareholders equity for the restatement of the unaudited quarterly statements of operations has a cumulative effect of reducing net income by  through the nine months ended september  the following table summarizes our historical results of operations by reporting segment 
for more detailed information concerning the components of revenues and expenses by segment  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 

table of contents years ended december  restated in thousands total revenues agency segment insurance company segment corporate and other segment eliminations total total expenses agency segment insurance company segment corporate and other segment eliminations total pretax income agency segment insurance company segment corporate and other segment eliminations total comparison of the year ended december  to december  consolidated 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to total revenues of million for the prior year 
the increase in total revenues was principally due to our retention of gross premiums written in our insurance companies following the termination of the reinsurance agreements with vesta  which allowed us to start retaining premiums beginning january  that were previously ceded to vesta 
for the year ended december   our consolidated financial statements reflect million in commission income and fees  as compared to million in the year ended december  this significant decrease on a reported consolidated basis is directly related to our significantly increased retention of business written and assumed by our insurance companies 
in our agencies  we earn commission income and fees that are based on written premiums 
in consolidation  we eliminate the commission income and fees based on business that our insurance companies retain against our agency segment expenses 
therefore  when we retain a higher percentage of our written premiums  as we did in as compared to  we eliminate a greater portion of the agency segment s commission and fees income  thereby reducing our reported consolidated commission income and fees 
our net premiums earned increase to reflect the revenue on the greater proportion of the business retained by us 
as more fully described in note reinsurance to our consolidated financial statements  in we ceded to non affiliates only million of gross written premiums direct and assumed premiums written of million  as compared to million of the million gross premiums written in as described in the discussion of our agency segment below  the total commission income and fees for before consolidating eliminations was million of gross written premiums as compared to million of gross written premiums in the prior year 
consolidated net investment income increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of a increase in invested assets to million at december  from million at december  the increase in invested assets is primarily the result of cash flows from operations 
the average investment yield increased to on a taxable equivalent basis in from on a taxable equivalent basis in primarily as the result of the higher interest rates available for new investments in in  the losses and loss adjustment expenses represented of net premiums earned our loss ratio  as compared to in see discussion of consolidated trade ratios below 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses of million represented of the sum of the year s net premiums earned and commission income and fees compared to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by from million in to million in largely due to the growth in our business 
in  we expensed a total of million for external auditing and external compliance consulting in connection with our year end financial statement audit and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  including million in the fourth quarter of  as compared to  in  including  in the fourth quarter of while we will remain subject to the requirements of 
table of contents the sarbanes oxley act of in future periods  we believe that the level of costs incurred in the fourth quarter of is not reflective of the recurring level of such costs in future periods 
total expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to total expenses of million for the prior year 
the increase in total expenses was principally due to increases in expenses related to our retention of premiums that were previously ceded to vesta 
as discussed above  as retention increases  a greater percentage of the agency segment expenses are eliminated in consolidation 
as noted in more detail in the discussion of our agency segment below  consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   included a million incurred in the fourth quarter of  related to separation and non competition agreements with three former executives  b  incurred for a retained search for a replacement executive and c million related to the write down of amounts capitalized on the enterprise system development and license agreement 
consolidated depreciation and amortization expenses included  in amortization on the same non competition agreements 
there were no expenses of a similar nature incurred in the fiscal year ended december  as noted in more detail in the discussion of our insurance segment below  net realized losses for the year ended december   included million related to the realignment of the investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio has not been realigned in previous fiscal periods 
pre tax income for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million for the prior year 
the decreases in pre tax income were due to lower pre tax margins in both the agency and insurance segments 
additional discussion regarding each segment is included below 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  or an effective rate of  as compared to income tax expense for the year ended december  of million  or an effective rate of 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to our deferred tax asset for state taxes 
this adjustment reduced our income tax expense by  in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an effective tax rate of for and a fourth quarter effective tax rate of due to the loss incurred in the quarter 
excluding the effect of this item  our effective tax rates would have been and for the year and the quarter  respectively 
this adjustment is a non recurring event and we anticipate that our future effective tax rates will be more similar to the effective tax rate for the year when this item is excluded 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in year ended december  excluding the effect of the adjustment to our deferred tax asset  as compared to prior year  was principally due to the favorable impact of tax exempt income from our investment portfolio following our initial public offering in july for the year ended december   minority interest net of income taxes was  as compared to  in the prior year 
the decrease in minority interest was a result of lower earnings of our space coast underwriting agency  where our ownership interest was for the periods presented 
for the year ended december   the loss in our equity interest in unconsolidated subsidiaries net of income taxes was zero as compared to  in the prior year 
the remainder of this investment was written off in the fourth quarter of consolidated trade ratios 
in past filings with the securities and exchange commission  we have employed trade ratio calculations loss ratio  expense ratio  and combined ratio that are different from those used by other companies engaged in the private passenger automobile insurance business 
we have historically calculated our ratios based on our insurance segment results with commission income and fees included in the divisor 
the more widely used industry calculation is based on consolidated results and includes all commission income and fees as a reduction in the dividend  with the divisor consisting of earned premium only 
our methodology has caused our loss ratio to appear lower and expense ratio to appear higher than would have been the case had we employed the more widely used method of calculation 
in this report on form k  our trade ratios are presented using the more widely used methodology on our consolidated results 
we believe that conforming our calculation to the more widely used methodology will make it easier for investors to compare our performance with other industry participants 
for the year ended december   our loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was as compared to in the prior year 
this improvement reflects decreases in our overall loss and loss adjustment expense ratio for both our owned and non owned programs due to favorable loss ratio development in the current period 
the impact from the favorable loss ratio development on our loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was for the year ended december  as compared to in the prior year 
for the year ended december   our expense ratio was as compared to in the prior year 
this increase in our expense ratio reflects the effect of the computational method that offsets our expenses with our commission income and fees in the dividend of the widely used industry calculation  with the divisor consisting of only net premiums earned 
as described above  commission income and fees included in our consolidated financial statements decreased million in to from million in as a result of the elimination entries related to our increased retention of business produced 
using an alternative financial computational method whereby commission income and fees are included in the divisor and total expenses other than losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest expense are the dividend  the total expenses other than losses and loss adjustment expenses and interest expense  which increased to million in  represented of revenues excluding investment income and realized losses as compared to million in  representing of revenues excluding investment income and realized losses 
the increase in expenses in includes certain expenses related to severance and non competition agreements with three former executives and the write off of the costs associated with an outside vendor s software development  as more fully discussed in the segment analysis below 
our combined ratio sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio on a consolidated basis for the year ended december  was as compared to in the prior year 

table of contents agency segment 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to total revenues of million in the prior year 
revenues for the years ended december  and were generated primarily through commissions  policy fees and claims processing fees  as follows years ended december  restated commission income policy and other fees claims processing fees investment income and other total commission income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or  as compared to commissions of million in the prior year 
we earned commissions in both our underwriting agencies and retail agencies 
commissions in our underwriting agencies  which include both provisional and profit sharing commissions  for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to million in the prior year 
provisional commission income for our underwriting agencies for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to provisional commissions of million in the prior year 
the million in provisional commission was favorably impacted by our recent acquisitions of fed usa and ipa 
ipa recorded provisional commission of million over the last six months of  while fed usa contributed  of provisional commission to our florida underwriting agency 
excluding these acquisitions  provisional commissions decreased million  or as compared to the prior year 
our provisional commission is derived from the total controlled premium produced by our underwriting agencies which decreased from the prior year 
excluding the above acquisitions  total controlled premium produced decreased from the prior year 
slightly offsetting this decrease was an overall increase in provisional commission rates which increased to for the year ended december  from in the prior year 
profit sharing commission income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  or  as compared to profit sharing commissions of million for the prior year 
profit sharing commissions are a result of favorable loss ratio development for business produced by our underwriting agencies as compared to loss ratios recorded as of the beginning of the period 
the increase in profit sharing commissions was the result of overall favorable loss ratio development in prior treaty years 
we have not recognized any profit sharing commission on treaties that incepted during commission income related to our retail agencies sales of unaffiliated insurance companies products was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  as compared to commissions related to our retail agencies sales of unaffiliated insurance companies products of million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to our december acquisition of fed usa  which accounted for million of commissions for the year ended december   offset by a decrease in commissions from sales of unaffiliated insurance companies products in our midwest operation due to increased competition 
policy and other fees for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  as compared to policy and other fees of million for the prior year 
the slight increase in policy and other fees was primarily due to million associated with the acquisitions of ipa in july and fed usa in december  offset by decreased policy fees associated with lower premium volume in our texas and midwest underwriting agencies 
claims processing fees for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to claims processing fees of million in the prior year 
claims processing fees are paid to us based on a contractual rate relative to the amount of gross premiums earned on business that our underwriting agencies produce and recognized as income over the expected claims service period 
the increase in claims processing fees is primarily attributable to the addition of allocated loss adjustment expenses in our remaining contracts starting in the increase in fees paid on these contracts will increase revenue over the service period 
total expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to total expenses of million in the prior year 
policy acquisition expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  or  as compared to million for the prior year 
policy acquisition expenses sole component is commission expense in our agency segment 
commission expense is derived from the production of total controlled premium 
the decrease in policy acquisition expenses is principally due to our decrease in total controlled premium as compared to prior year 
excluding the acquisitions of fed usa and ipa discussed earlier  total controlled premium decreased from prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average commission rate to from in the prior year 
this increase results from changes in the geographic distribution of our policies produced as well as increases in commission rates in certain geographic areas in response to existing market conditions 
the commission rates we pay independent agents are established based on prevailing market conditions 
employee compensation and benefit expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in employee compensation and benefit expenses was primarily due to an increase in compensation during from the fed usa and ipa acquisitions  which 
table of contents caused an increase of million as compared to prior year as well as million in severance related expenses paid or accrued to three former executives during in addition  these acquisitions  as well as increased medical costs  were the primary cause in the increase in healthcare expense of  as compared to the prior year 
during  normal salary increases and increases in incentive compensation caused an increase of million in employee compensation as compared to the previous year 
we also had increases in human resource related expenses such as recruiting and relocation of  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the increased headcount as well as  incurred for a retained search for our permanent chief executive officer 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to the same in the prior year 
depreciation expense decreased by  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was offset by  increase in amortization expense primarily due to two non competition agreements with former executives 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of contractual changes  expansion through acquisitions  and legal and professional expenditures 
our acquisitions of fed usa and ipa caused increases in expenses in areas such as advertising  rent and premium taxes and fronting fees 
in total  operating expenses increased million from the prior year due to these acquisitions 
during we experienced continued increases in allocated loss adjustment expenses over the prior year of million 
the increase in allocated loss adjustment expense payments is a result of changes in contractual terms where our payment of allocated loss adjustment expenses is included in all of our claims administration contracts in  where in  this additional expense was not in all our contracts for the full year 
in addition we incurred increases in legal and professional fees of million  primarily due to increased audit fees and fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act of during the fourth quarter of  management determined that the outside vendor used to develop our new enterprise system had not met the terms of the development and license agreement and had breached the contract 
we have since initiated litigation and are seeking relief to the full extent possible 
at present  however  we do not expect to be in a position to introduce this system before the end of  if at all  therefore we have written off the amounts capitalized on this project in the fourth quarter of  which caused an increase in expense over the prior year in the amount of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in areas such as licenses  taxes and fees and underwriting reports as well as bank charges and other miscellaneous expenses in the amount of million  as well as million increase in expenses allocated to our insurance segment in due to increased efforts in this segment

insurance company segment 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to total revenues of million for the prior year 
the increase in total revenues was principally due to our continued increased retention of gross premiums written by our insurance companies 
the increased capitalization of our insurance companies from the proceeds of our initial public offering in july and the issuance of trust preferred securities in december  enabled us to increase retention amounts at july and  again  at january we retained approximately of our total controlled premium for the year ended december   as compared to in the prior year 
net premiums earned for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million in the prior year 
the increased capitalization mentioned above enabled us to increase retention amounts at july and again at january partially offsetting this increase in retention is a decline in our overall total controlled premium primarily due to increased competition in our affiliated agencies as well as the run off of programs in our non affiliated distribution channel 
commission income for the year ended december  was  compared to zero in the prior year 
this increase is due to the accounting for the novation agreement we entered into which was effective august  we accounted for this contract under the deposit accounting rules according to fas see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
net investment income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from net investment income of million in the prior year 
the increase in investment income is attributable to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio due to the capital contributions into our insurance companies after our initial public offering and the issuance of trust preferred securities  as well as operating cash flow resulting from the increased retention of gross premiums written 
net realized losses for the year ended december  were million as compared to net realized losses of  for the same period in the increase in the net realized losses is due to our decision to sell a portion of our investment portfolio in order to better align our portfolio with our historical claims life 
specifically  the investment committee determined that all securities with a maturity after december  should be sold 
we determined that the identified securities would not fully recover fair market value would not equal or exceed amortized cost prior to the expected sale date  therefore the securities were deemed other than temporarily impaired in december when the decision to sell was made 
our agreements with our owned and non owned underwriting agencies contain sliding scale commission schedules that may change our ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and our expense ratio based upon ultimate performance of each agency 
the impact from favorable loss ratio development in current periods decreases our losses and loss adjustment expense ratio due to lower selected loss ratios and increases our expense ratio due to increased commissions due to our owned and non owned agencies in the form of profit sharing commissions

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own 
consequently  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders  meet our debt payment obligations and pay our taxes and administrative expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries  including our insurance company subsidiaries 
there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends by our non insurance company subsidiaries other than state corporate laws regarding solvency 
as a result  our non insurance company subsidiaries generate revenues  profits and net cash flows that are generally unrestricted as to their availability for the payment of dividends  and we expect to use those revenues to service our corporate financial obligations  such as debt service and stockholder dividends 
as of december   we had million of cash and invested assets at the holding company level and million of cash and invested assets at our non insurance company subsidiaries 

table of contents state insurance laws restrict the ability of our insurance company subsidiaries to declare stockholder dividends 
these subsidiaries may not make an extraordinary dividend until days after the applicable commissioner of insurance has received notice of the intended dividend and has not objected in such time or until the commissioner has approved the payment of the extraordinary dividend within the day period 
an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or distribution of cash or other property whose fair market value  together with that of other dividends and distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s net income for the month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices

in  million was received from our initial public offering and million was received in december for the private placement of trust preferred securities  partially offset by a million principal payment on a note payable 
in  million in cash was used to repay borrowings 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  as well as new cash flows generated from operations and our available credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs during the month period following the date of this report at both the holding company and insurance company levels 
we do not currently know of any events that could cause a material increase or decrease in our long term liquidity needs 
initial public offering 
we completed our initial public offering of our common stock effective july  we issued  additional shares of our common stock and vesta sold  shares of our common stock that they owned  at an initial public offering price of per share

trust preferred securities 
on june   our newly formed trust subsidiary  affirmative insurance holdings statutory trust ii trust subsidiary ii  completed a private placement of million of year floating rate trust preferred securities 
simultaneously  we borrowed million from trust subsidiary ii and the net proceeds from this borrowing  along with cash from operations  were used to purchase the million shares of our common stock as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the trust preferred securities  which can be redeemed in whole or in part by the issuer after five years  bear an initial interest rate of until june   at which time they will adjust quarterly to the day libor rate plus basis points 
contractual obligations the following table identifies our contractual obligations by payment due period as of december  total consideration due for acquisitions operating leases notes payable interest on notes payable reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense total consists primarily of payments due in related to the asset purchase of insureone independent agency  llc and fed usa 
consists primarily of rental obligations under real estate leases related to our retail operations and our corporate offices 
the payout pattern for reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense is based upon historical payment patterns and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
the timing and amount ultimately paid can and will vary from these estimates 
we and our subsidiaries are named from time to time as defendants in various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and arising out of or related to claims made in connection with our insurance policies  claims handling and employment related disputes 
we believe that the resolution of these legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  however  the ultimate outcome of these matters is uncertain 
for detailed information concerning legal actions  please refer to legal proceedings contained elsewhere in this report 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are subject to random compliance audits from federal and state authorities regarding various operations within our business that involve collecting and remitting taxes in one form or another 
recently  two of our owned underwriting agencies were subject to a sales and use tax audit conducted by the state of texas 
the examiner for the state of texas has now completed his field work and delivered a summary of tentative audit adjustment to us 
the examiner s report asserts that  for the period from january to august  we should have collected and remitted approximately million in sales tax derived from claims services provided for old american county mutual insurance company  an unaffiliated insurance company 
we believe that these services are not subject to sales tax  are vigorously contesting the assertions made by the state  and are exercising all available rights and remedies available to us  however  the ultimate outcome of this matter is uncertain 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that interest rate risk and credit risk are the two types of market risk to which we are principally exposed 
interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade  fixed income securities  all of which are classified as available for sale 
accordingly  the primary market risk exposure to our debt securities is interest rate risk 
in general the fair market value of a portfolio of fixed income securities increases or decreases inversely with changes in market interest rates  while net investment income realized from future investments in fixed income securities increases or decreases along with interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall and issuers call their securities and we reinvest at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this interest rate risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates and by managing the duration of our investment portfolio to a defined range of less than three years 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million 
the effective duration of the portfolio as of december  was years 
should the market interest rates increase  our fixed income investment portfolio would be expected to decline in market value by  or million  representing the effective duration multiplied by the change in market interest rates 

table of contents conversely  a decline in interest rates would result in a  or million  increase in the market value of our fixed income investment portfolio 
credit risk 
an additional exposure to our fixed income securities portfolio is credit risk 
we attempt to manage our credit risk by investing only in investment grade securities and limiting our exposure to a single issuer 
as of december   our fixed income investments were invested in the following us treasury securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate securities  and municipal securities 
as of december   all of our fixed income securities were rated a or better by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
we are subject to credit risks with respect to our reinsurers 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of the coverage which it assumes  our reinsurance contracts do not discharge our insurance companies from primary liability to each policyholder for the full amount of the applicable policy  and consequently our insurance companies remain obligated to pay claims in accordance with the terms of the policies regardless of whether a reinsurer fulfills or defaults on its obligations under the related reinsurance agreement 
in order to mitigate credit risk to reinsurance companies  we attempt to select financially strong reinsurers with an am best rating of a or better and continue to evaluate their financial condition 
at december   we had million receivables from reinsurers  including million gross recoverable from vesta fire 
vesta fire is currently rated c marginal by am best 
according to our reinsurance agreement  if vesta fire s am best financial strength rating remains below b we have the right to require vesta fire to provide a letter of credit or establish a trust account to collateralize the gross amounts due to us from vesta fire under the reinsurance agreement 
on july   we notified vesta to establish a trust account collateralizing the amount due to us  due to the fact that vesta fire s am best rating was below a b after the consummation of our initial public offering 
we have million currently in a trust account to collateralize the million gross recoverable from vesta fire 
we also have million included in other assets that is related to a receivable due from vesta as part of the transfer of the insurance companies to us at december  the million is not included in the previously mentioned million gross recoverable 
as part of the terms of the acquisition of affirmative insurance company and insura  vesta has indemnified us for any losses due to uncollectible reinsurance related to reinsurance agreements entered into with unaffiliated reinsurers prior to december  as of december   all such unaffiliated reinsurers had am best ratings of a or better 
effects of inflation 
we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our results of operations  except for the effect that inflation may have on interest rates and claims costs 
the effects of inflation are considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid claims and claim expenses 
the actual effects of inflation on our results are not known until claims are ultimately settled 
in addition to general price inflation  we are exposed to a persisting long term upward trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages 
we attempt to mitigate the effects of inflation in our pricing and establishing of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf provides guidance with respect to the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method 
in september  the fasb issued a staff position  fsp eitf  delaying the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in eitf  and also issued an exposure draft  fsp eitf a  which proposes guidance relating to debt securities that are impaired because of interest rate and or sector spread increases 
the delay in the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of eitf did not suspend existing requirements for assessing whether investment impairments are other than temporary 
we currently perform an analysis for impairment of investments on a quarterly basis 
we do not anticipate that this will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r sfas r  share based compensation  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
this standard is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r 
in particular  sab provides supplemental implementation guidance on sfas r  including guidance on valuation methods  classification of compensation expense  inventory capitalization of share based compensation cost  income tax effects  disclosures in management s discussion and analysis and several other issues 
we will apply the principles of sab in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r permits us to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the adoption date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based compensation payments granted after the adoption date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  until december  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic 
table of contents value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost on grants of employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r may have a significant impact on our results of operations that cannot be predicted at this time because the impact will depend on the future levels of share based grants 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb and sfas sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles 
the statement requires that voluntary changes in accounting principles be applied retrospectively to prior periods unless doing so is impracticable 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we applied sfas to our presented financial statements and in notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas and fas  which nullifies certain provisions of eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and completely supersedes eitf topic d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value  addresses determining when an investment should be considered impaired  determining whether an impairment should be deemed other than temporary  and measuring impairment loss 
combined fsp nos 
fas and fas were applied to the realignment of a portion of our investment portfolio as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
special note regarding forward looking statements any statement contained in this report which is not a historical fact  or which might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning the company or its business  whether express or implied  is meant as and should be considered a forward looking statement as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are based on assumptions and opinions concerning a variety of known and unknown risks  including but not necessarily limited to changes in market conditions  natural disasters and other catastrophic events  increased competition  changes in availability and cost of reinsurance  changes in governmental regulations  and general economic conditions  as well as other risks more completely described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
if any of these assumptions or opinions prove incorrect  any forward looking statements made on the basis of such assumptions or opinions may also prove materially incorrect in one or more respects
