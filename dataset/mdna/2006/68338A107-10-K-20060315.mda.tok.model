item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading video compression technology firm 
we have developed a proprietary technology platform and video compression decompression software codec to allow the efficient storage of high quality video and delivery of that video at the lowest possible data rates over proprietary networks and the internet to personal computers  wireless devices and set top boxes 
we offer a suite of products and services based on our proprietary compression technology and multimedia server software 
our service offerings include customized engineering  consulting services  technical support and high level video encoding 
in addition  we license our software products  which include video and audio codecs  encoding and server software  for use with video delivery platforms 
we have also recently begun to license software that encodes video in the adobe macromedia flash format  the flash format uses our vp video codec 
company history founded in as the duck corporation  a privately owned entity  we originally developed and marketed compression technology that enabled developers of computer video games  video games for dedicated video game consoles and multi media presentations on computers to convert an analog video signal to a digital video signal  and to compress the signal for storage and playback on the required device 
in june of  the duck corporation was merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of applied capital funding  inc  a public company whose name was concurrently changed to oncom inc and subsequently changed to on technologies  inc at that time  we had developed proprietary technology that enabled the compression  storage and streaming of high quality video signals over high bandwidth networks ie broadband 
we adopted a business model in which we would develop our own broadband content network powered by our proprietary technology 
we intended to generate revenue through advertising sales and electronic commerce 
through the first quarter of  we devoted substantially all of our efforts to building a content network and enhancing the technology to operate it 
in that time  we made three acquisitions metavisual creations limited metavisual  celebrity interviews cii and quickband networks  inc quickband 
metavisual was a compression technology firm located in the united kingdom and had developed its own video compression technology 
that technology is instrumental in the compression technology we offer today 
cii and quickband were entities that had created  and had the resources to continue to create  content that we had intended to incorporate into our content network 
through cii and quickband  we primarily acquired produced content  certain distribution arrangements and certain production personnel 
by the second quarter of  with the rapid decline in the internet industry and the lack of interest in content networks  we determined that operating a content network would not be profitable for the foreseeable future 
this was evident through rapid declines in internet advertising and electronic commerce  the two areas in which we intended to generate our revenues 
at no time did we generate any revenues from the content network 
revenues generated from any content related assets were the result of legacy arrangements in place prior to our acquisitions of cii and quickband 
as such  we decided to cease production on our content network and developed a strategic business model to distribute our video compression technology to ip based clients as well as those offering video through proprietary networks and consumer electronics and wireless devices 
this is the business model under which we currently operate 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we have limited experience forecasting our revenues and operating costs 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
to date  we have incurred substantial costs to create technology products and services 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we will continue to incur costs to develop  introduce and enhance products and services  build brand awareness  and expand our business 
we may also incur significant additional costs related to technology  marketing or acquisitions of businesses and technologies to respond to changes in this rapidly developing industry 
these costs may not correspond with any meaningful increases in revenues in the near term  if at all 
as such  these costs may result in negative operating cash flows until such time as we generate sufficient revenues to offset such costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have disclosed all significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are o revenue recognition o equity based compensation o valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets revenue recognition 
we currently recognize revenue from professional services and the sale of software licenses 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the amount of revenue recognized in any given accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any given accounting period depending upon judgments made by or estimates utilized by management 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  and sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions sop 
under each arrangement  revenues are recognized when a non cancelable agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the products or applications have been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as product licenses  post contract customer support  or training 
the determination of the fair value is based on the vendor specific objective evidence available to us 
if such evidence of the fair value of each element of the arrangement does not exist  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until such time that evidence of the fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
our software licensing arrangements typically consist of two elements a software license and post contract customer support pcs 
we recognize license revenues based on the residual method after all elements other than pcs have been delivered as prescribed by sop we recognize pcs revenues over the term of the maintenance contract or on a per usage basis  whichever is stated in the contract 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of pcs is determined by reference to the price the customer will have to pay for pcs when it is sold separately ie the renewal rate 
most of our license agreements offer additional pcs at a stated price 
revenue is recognized on a per copy basis for licensed software when each copy of the licensed software purchased by the customer or reseller is delivered 
we do not allow returns  exchanges or price protection for sales of software licenses to our customers or resellers  and we do not allow our resellers to purchase software licenses under consignment arrangements 
when engineering and consulting services are sold together with a software license  the arrangement typically requires customization and integration of the software into a third party hardware platform 
in these arrangements  we require the customer to pay a fixed fee for the engineering and consulting services and a licensing fee for rights to the software 
we account for engineering and consulting arrangements in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop 
when reasonably dependable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the engineering or consulting services and those services do not include contractual milestones or other acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion contract method based upon input measures  such as hours 
when such estimates are not available  we defer all revenue recognition until we have completed the contract and have no further obligations to the customer 
encoding services consist of services that convert video and audio content into formats for delivery to end users 
encoding services are generally provided under per unit or time and materials contracts 
under these contracts  we recognize revenue when services have been rendered and we have no further interest or obligation in the goods and services  which is generally the date on which the goods or services have been delivered to the customer 
equity based compensation 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation encourages the use of the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
alternatively  sfas no 
allows entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provide pro forma disclosures of net income loss and earnings loss per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied to employee awards 
the company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion and provide the disclosures required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas requires goodwill and other intangible assets to be tested for impairment at least annually  and written off when impaired  rather than being amortized as previously required long lived assets and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
as of december   the company believes that no such impairment has occurred 
results of operations revenue 
revenue for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively and was derived from the sale of software licenses  engineering and consulting services and license royalties 
revenue decreased  for the year ended december  as compared with the decrease is attributable to the sale of a single license to macromedia for approximately  in partially offset by increases in revenue generated from license royalties and the sale of licenses from our flix line of flash encoding software 
as a percent of total sales  license revenue increased to in from in while engineering services and support decreased to in from in and royalties increased to of sales in from in revenue decreased  for the year ended december  as compared with the decrease is attributable to a small decrease in engineering fees 
for the year ended december   license revenue was  of which the company s vpx licenses were  and flix licenses were  for the year ended december  and  license revenue was  and  respectively  consisting of all vpx licenses 
the following table sets forth the allocation of revenues  in terms of percentages  for the years ended december   and licenses engineering services and support royalties total for the years ended december   and  software licenses were the significant revenue stream and are expected to be the significant future revenue stream as we continue to provide these services and products to clients who deliver high quality video to proprietary networks  consumer electronic devices  wireless applications and ip based end users 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses consist of cost of revenues  research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december   and were   and  respectively 
cost of revenue

cost of revenue was  for the year ended december  as compared with  for the year ended december  cost of revenue increased  for the year ended december  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately  in personnel and related overhead   associated with the support of the flix product line by wildform in  and  in amortization of the flix software assets 
cost of revenues was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cost of revenue decreased  for the year ended december   however when excluding amortization of  in related to purchased technology  cost of revenue increased by  the  increase is due to  in equity based compensation and  in additional personnel costs

research and development expenses were  for the year ended december  the decrease of  in the year ended december  as compared with  is primarily from a decrease in personnel and depreciation allocated to research and development 
we believe that continued investments in research and development are necessary to improve our competitive advantage and we will continue to invest in such costs as considered necessary

the company currently has no material commitments for the next months other than those under operating lease arrangements 
these arrangements consist primarily of lease arrangements for the company s office space in clifton park and new york city 
the aggregate required payments for the next months under these arrangements are  additionally  notwithstanding the above  our most significant non contractual operating costs for the next months are compensation and benefit costs  insurance costs and general overhead costs such as telephone and utilities 
during  we anticipate incurring approximately  per month in cash operating costs 
the company believes that existing funds are sufficient to fund its operations through the company plans to increase cash flows from operations principally from increases in revenue generated from its compression technology services and products 
the company may also pursue additional financings 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect future operating results 
in october  the company designated  shares of its authorized preferred stock as series d convertible preferred stock  par value series d preferred and completed the sale of  shares of series d preferred at  per share to two institutional investors  led by midsummer investment ltd  for net proceeds of  the series d convertible preferred is convertible at any time into common stock at an initial conversion price of per share of common stock 
the series d preferred is mandatorily redeemable by the company over an month period beginning in october such redemptions can be made in cash or common stock  at the company s option 
if redemptions are made in common stock  the number of shares issuable upon redemption is dependent on the average of the volume weighted average trading price of the common stock for the trading days immediately prior to the redemption date 
the investors also received one year warrants the series a warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and five year warrants the series b warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the series d preferred and warrants are subject to certain anti dilution protection for issuances of securities below the conversion price 
holders of series d preferred are entitled to receive an annual cumulative dividend  payable quarterly in cash or shares of common stock at the company s option  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in  the series d investors have exercised all of the series a warrants and paid the exercise price of  to the company 
the series d preferred includes a liquidation preference 
in the event of any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company  either voluntary or involuntary  the holders of shares of series d preferred are entitled to receive an amount equal to  per share 
the liquidation price per share would be paid out of the assets of the company available for distribution prior to any payments made on any shares of the company s junior securities 
we have experienced significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows to date 
our management s plan to increase our cash flows from operations relies significantly on increases in revenue generated from our compression technology services and products 
however  there are no assurances that we will be successful in effecting such increases 
the market for distribution of compression technology services is highly competitive 
additionally  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our technology and services  research and development costs and the resources we spend on marketing and selling our products and services 
additionally  we continue to evaluate investments in complementary businesses  products and services  some of which may be significant 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

revised share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise exchanges its equity instruments for employee services 
it also addresses transactions in which an enterprise incurs liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments in exchange for employee services 
the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments  including employee stock options  is to be measured on the grant date fair value of those instruments 
that cost will be recognized as compensation expense over the service period  which would normally be the vesting period 
sfas r became effective for the company as of january  the impact of adopting sfas r cannot currently be estimated since it will depend on future share based awards

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
limitation on use of net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards at december   the company had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  the net operating loss carry forwards expire at various dates through section of the internal revenue code provides that when a corporation undergoes an ownership change  the corporation s use of its net operating losses is limited in each subsequent year 
an ownership change occurs when  as of any testing date  the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company s stock as compared to that shareholder s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding three year period exceeds fifty percentage points 
for purposes of this rule  certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company s stock are aggregated and treated as a single five percent stockholder 
the merger of the duck corporation with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of applied capital funding  inc may have involved an ownership change and thus we may be unable to use a material portion of our available net operating loss carry forwards 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company history 
furthermore  in the ordinary course of the company s business operations we have and may continue to issue shares in conjunction with acquisitions or additional financing  in order to meet the company s growth objectives and liquidity constraints 
in addition  the exercise of outstanding warrants and certain options to purchase shares of common stock may require us to issue additional shares of common stock 
past and future issuances of shares of common stock may limit our ability to use a substantial amount of our available net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future taxable income 
the extent of the actual future use of our net operating loss carry forwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn 
we cannot give any assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our net operating loss carry forwards before they would otherwise expire 
risk factors that may affect future operating results in evaluating our business  prospective investors and shareholders should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this k or in the documents referred to in this k 
any of the following risks could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition and result in a complete loss of your investment 
we may need to obtain additional cash to operate our business  and to be able to execute our business plan and may not achieve profitability 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flow from operations  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
on february   we had cash reserves of approximately  during fiscal  we expect to meet our working capital obligations and other cash requirements with cash derived from the sale of our products and services and from our cash reserves 
there can be no assurance  however  that cash derived from the sale of our products and services will be sufficient for our operating needs or that we will be able to achieve profitability on a consistent basis  if at all 
in the event that cash used in operations is higher than anticipated and we are unable to secure additional funding  in order to preserve cash  we would be required to further reduce expenditures and effect further reductions in our corporate infrastructure  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current level of operations 
even if we obtain additional working capital in the near future  to the extent that operating expenses increase or we need additional funds to make acquisitions  develop new technologies or acquire strategic assets  the need for additional funding may be accelerated and there can be no assurances that any such additional funding can be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we cannot generate sufficient positive cash flows from our operations  our operating results and our stock price may be negatively impacted 
we currently do not generate sufficient revenues to offset our operating costs 
moreover  as we continue to expand our product and service offerings to maintain our competitive advantage  we may be required to incur additional costs to hire and retain additional personnel  license complementary third party technology for use in our proprietary software or expand both our international and domestic presence to enter new markets 
these costs may significantly increase our current level of monthly operating expenses 
failure to generate sufficient capital through both our revenue streams and financings may require us to execute additional corporate restructurings  scale back our product or service offerings or limit the markets into which we enter 
any of these items  or a combination thereof  could have a harmful effect on our operating results and our stock price 
we have a history of losses and negative cash flow from operations and anticipate continued losses 
we have not achieved profitability  and it is a possibility that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future as we fund operating and capital expenditures in implementing our business plan 
our business model assumes that consumers will be attracted to and use broadband specific video compression technology to access content available on customer web sites or over proprietary networks that will  in turn  allow us to provide our technology solutions to customers 
our business model is not yet proven  and we cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability or that our operating losses will not increase in the future 
our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may not be able to adequately address all or any of these risks 
even if we are able to achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability 
in either case  our operating results and liquidity would be harmed 
our stock price may fluctuate for reasons beyond our control  which could result in losses on your investment in our stock 
fluctuations in the market price of our common stock may adversely affect our access to capital and financing and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
historically  our common stock price has fluctuated widely  with a week range as of march  of to 
we expect fluctuations to continue in the future for a number of reasons  including o quarterly variations in our operating results  o competitive announcements  o the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  o news relating to trends in our markets  and o changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet analyst estimates 
in addition  the stock market generally has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of companies in our industry have been highly volatile 
due to the volatility of the stock market generally  the price of our common stock could fluctuate for reasons beyond our control 
the sale of shares eligible for future sale in the open market may cause our stock price to decline and could hinder our future ability to raise capital 
sales of significant amounts of our common stock in the public market in the future  the perception that sales will occur  or the registration of shares could significantly depress the market price of our common stock or hinder our future ability to raise capital 
we have granted some of the holders of our securities demand registration rights and anti dilution protections  which may require us to issue additional shares to those holders certain triggering events occur  such as our failure to register such holders shares or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock below a certain price 
we may also issue additional shares in acquisitions and may grant additional stock options to our employees  officers  directors and consultants under the stock option plans 
if we are unable to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
our ability to execute our growth plan and be successful depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
as we continue to grow  we will need to hire additional personnel in all operational areas 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  customers could experience delays in service  which could  in turn  adversely affect our operating results and revenue 
additionally  retention of highly skilled employees may require additional personnel costs or the issuance of certain equity compensation 
these factors would reduce profitability and the price of our common stock 
much of our technology relies on owned or licensed intellectual property  and if such rights are not protected from the use of others  including potential competitors  our business prospects may be harmed 
the failure to protect our intellectual property could seriously harm our businesses and prospects because we believe that our technology is unique and that its proprietary nature is critical to our success 
if our prospects are harmed  the price of our common stock may decline because we may be less attractive to investors 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property through trademarks  copyrights  patents  trade secret laws  access to information and confidentiality agreements may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights 
even with all of these precautions  it could be possible for someone else to either copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without our authorization or to develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available  and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is difficult and expensive 
we cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in the future  we may need to go to court to either enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
that litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
although we do not currently license material third party technologies the loss of which could adversely affect our business  we do from time to time license from third parties technologies incorporated into some of our products and services 
as we continue to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies  we may be required to license additional technology from others 
we cannot be sure that these third party technology licenses will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the broadband video services and technology markets are highly competitive  and our failure to compete effectively could hurt our revenue and reduce our gross margins and profitability 
we face significant competition in the market for our technology and services 
in establishing our broadband strategy  we face a number of strong  firmly entrenched competitors  who are currently providing similar services to low bandwidth users and high bandwidth users and have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us 
these and other companies have announced plans to provide broadband video based services and technology 
in addition to competition from other internet content and technology companies  well established media distribution companies  particularly in the cable television and satellite markets  have established  and continue to seek to establish  interactive  on demand digital services through the development of sophisticated digital set top technology and related back end server systems 
those competitors could cause us to lose customers and impair our ability to attract new customers 
if we fail to keep pace with technological advances in our industry or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted  customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
our future success depends  in large part  on our ability to use leading technologies effectively  to develop our technological expertise  to enhance our existing services and to develop new services that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis 
we are unable to predict which technological developments will challenge our competitive position or the amount of expenditures that will be required to respond to a rapidly changing technological environment 
our failure to respond in a timely and effective manner to new and evolving technologies could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition 
regulatory changes in the internet industry involve uncertainties  and the resolution of these uncertainties could adversely affect our business by raising our costs or reducing potential revenues 
although we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any governmental agency other than rules and regulations that apply to businesses generally and any export and import controls which may apply to our products  laws and regulations specifically pertaining to the internet are new and developing 
these laws  when enacted may require us to comply with new procedures or limit the scope of our technology or services  which could raise our expenses or reduce our revenues 
the developing laws and regulations govern matters such as online content  intellectual property  user privacy  e commerce  information security and taxation 
moreover  we may be liable to third parties for any content that we encode  distribute or make available on our website if that content violates a third party s intellectual property rights or violates any applicable laws  such as obscenity laws or defamation laws 
in addition  the applicability of existing laws to the internet is uncertain and evolving 
effects of anti takeover provisions could inhibit potential investors or delay or prevent a change of control that may favor you 
some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately o discourage potential acquisition proposals  o delay or prevent a change in control  and o limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in particular  our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock less any outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to our common stock  without the consent of the holders of the common stock 
we have never paid common stock dividends and do not anticipate paying common stock dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain earnings  if any  to support our growth strategy 
we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not currently have any material exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  exchange rate risk  commodity price risk or other relevant market rate or price risks 
however  the company does have some exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from maintaining an office for the company s uk based  wholly owned subsidiary which transacts business in the local functional currency 
the uk based subsidiary does not conduct any sales and all their costs are funded in united states dollars 
to date  the company has not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk and is not currently evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
