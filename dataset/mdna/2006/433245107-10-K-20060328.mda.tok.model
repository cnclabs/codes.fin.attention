sale of acres in miami  florida on november   we successfully completed the miami land sale and received net proceeds from the sale of approximately million 
we will lease the entire property for a one year period  with a thirty day extension right  and will then vacate approximately acres 
we will lease the remaining acres for an additional one year period  with extension rights for an additional ninety days  and will then vacate the remaining acreage 
the terms of the lease agreement require us to pay the buyer rent of five hundred dollars per outstanding acre  annually  during the lease term 
for accounting purposes  the entire gain has been deferred due to our continuing involvement  as defined in sfas no 
 in the property 
sale of acres in vacaville  california in april  we entered into an option agreement to sell our acre nursery property in vacaville  california 
we entered into the option agreement because the nursery property is located in an area which the city of vacaville is planning to develop as a residential project 
this agreement was subsequently amended in march to extend the option term to march  contingent upon payments of million during the option term 
on march   the buyer exercised its option to purchase the property 
total proceeds from the option agreement and sale of the land will be approximately million  with the final payment of million due no later than april  under the terms of the option agreement  we are able to transition off the land in three phases from to we are continuing to develop replacement acreage and infrastructure at our acre winters facility in northern california 
discontinued operations in march  we completed the sale of sun gro horticulture  which we refer to as sun gro  to a newly established canadian income fund 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale  which includes the tax refunds from the canadian customs revenue authority ccra recorded in the fourth quarter of and third quarter of  the majority of which were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
as a result of the sale of sun gro  we no longer harvest or produce peat moss or other growing soil mixes 
our consolidated financial statements included in this form k for reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of sun gro as discontinued operations 
united states tax matters as a result of our business activities  we qualify for a special exception under the us federal tax code that allows us to use the cash method of accounting for federal income tax purposes 
under the cash method  sales are included in taxable income when payments are received and expenses are deducted as they are paid 
we derive significant tax benefits by being able to deduct the cost of inventory as the cost is incurred 
as a result of our ability to utilize the cash method of accounting  we have historically generated net operating losses for federal income tax purposes 
during the year  we were required to pay federal cash income taxes in the form of alternative minimum tax as a result of the miami land sale 
at december   we had million in net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which begin to expire in in addition  we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax reporting purposes 
our state net operating losses in certain states begin expiring in based on our current projections  we anticipate that we will incur tax liability and begin paying cash income taxes for federal purposes in and we are currently paying cash income taxes for state income tax purposes in certain states due to the differing rules regarding the utilization of net operating losses 
the use of the cash method of accounting for federal income tax purposes resulted in a current deferred tax liability for accounting purposes 
at december   we had a current deferred liability of million related to the use of the cash method of accounting 
the deferred tax liability is deemed current for accounting purposes because the majority of the items to which this liability relates are comprised of current assets and current liabilities in our balance sheet such as inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
the classification of this liability as a current item  however  does not mean that it is required to be paid within the next twelve months 
canadian tax matters in connection with the sale of sun gro  the canadian customs revenue authority ccra required that approximately million canadian of the gross proceeds from the transaction be withheld in an escrow account pending the determination of whether certain aspects of the sale were taxable for canadian purposes 
the proceeds withheld were not included in the initial measurement of the loss on the sale of sun gro 
on november   we filed a tax return  submitted a tax payment of million canadian from the escrow funds and submitted a claim for refund on the basis that the transaction is exempt from tax for canadian purposes 
the balance of the escrow funds of million canadian us million was then remitted to us and was recorded in the fourth quarter of as an adjustment to the loss on the sale of sun gro 
on september   the ccra completed its assessment of our tax return in which it determined that the transaction was exempt from tax for canadian purposes and issued a refund to us of all taxes paid  plus accrued interest 
we received the refund check of million canadian us million on october  and recorded it in the third quarter of as an adjustment to the loss on the sale of sun gro 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal 
the seasonal nature of our operations results in a significant increase in our working capital between the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities in the first and fourth quarters use significant amounts of cash  and in contrast  operating activities in the second and third quarters generate substantial cash as we ship inventory and collect accounts receivable 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant variability in net sales  operating income and net income on a quarterly basis 
lovell farms arbitration settlement in connection with the acquisition of lovell farms  we agreed  subject to various provisions in the purchase agreement  to make earn out payments to the sellers claimants of up to approximately million for fiscal if certain performance thresholds were met 
we determined that the thresholds were not met and that no earn out payment be made 
in response to this decision  the claimants initiated arbitration proceedings  which concluded in may going into the hearings  the claimants demanded that the arbitrator award million and payment of their attorney s fees and costs 
a final determination was made on july  awarding the claimants million and denying their request for attorney fees and costs 
payment of the million increased our goodwill during the third quarter of legal defense fees and other costs incurred in connection with the arbitration of million were expensed during the fiscal year ended december  phytophthera ramorum or sudden oak death on september   we announced that our forest grove  oregon facility had suspended the shipment of all plant material known capable of carrying phytophthora ramorum  the plant pathogen known to cause sudden oak death sod  as a result of receiving an emergency action notification from the us department of agriculture usda stating that a routine inspection had resulted in a positive detection of the pathogen 
after several months of testing  it was determined that only two areas within the nursery had been exposed to the pathogen  which resulted in the destruction of approximately million  or  of our oregon inventory 
as a result of a trace forward test  we identified that several customers had received product from the two exposed areas  and accordingly  we agreed to assist them with the destruction of the identified inventory 
this resulted in customer credits of approximately million and lost sales of approximately million in we have also incurred approximately million in sod clean up costs in on december   the usda determined that our forest grove  oregon facility was free of sod and lifted the emergency action notification 
as of december   our forest grove  oregon facility and all of our california facilities are sod free and are operating under usda sod compliance agreements 
for additional information concerning sod  see risks related to our business 
pay by scan in january  we entered into an agreement with our largest customer to sell a portion of our product under a pay by scan program 
under this program  our customer does not take ownership of the inventory at its stores until the product is scanned at the check out register 
revenue is recorded at the point the store sells our product to its customer 
sales under this program began in february on a limited basis 
annuals and perennials are the only products impacted by this agreement 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from net sales of million in the decline in net sales was primarily due to lower sales unit volume  partially offset by a slight increase in our overall average unit selling price per unit compared to last year 
the decline in sales unit volume of million  or  from units sold in was mainly due to the impact of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma in the south and the southeastern regions  while the slight price increase was primarily due to improved product mix and the new pay by scan program 
looking at sales from a quarterly perspective first quarter net sales in increased approximately million  or  from net sales for the comparable period in the increase in first quarter net sales was a result of improved customer pricing  favorable changes to our product mix and a higher volume of early spring shipments into markets in the east

second quarter net sales in in the northeast declined as a result of the timing of easter sales and lower consumer demand for bedding plants

gross profit 
gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from gross profit of million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the year decreased to compared to in the decline in gross profit and gross profit margin percentage was attributable to lower sales volume  increased scrap as a result of the hurricanes in the third and fourth quarters of and higher raw material and commodity costs 
this was especially true for petroleum based plastic containers and higher fuel costs 
although we received a minimal increase in our average selling price per unit  it was not significant enough to offset the increased raw material and commodity costs that we experienced during selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in selling expenses for the fiscal year ended december  of million decreased million  or  from a year ago mainly as a result of the cost savings generated from the reorganization carried out in the second quarter of which included the realignment of certain aspects of management as well as a permanent reduction in headcount  but such cost savings were partially offset by an increase in advertising costs of million  as well as an increase in third party merchandising costs of million 
distribution expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the comparable period in the increase in distribution expenses was attributable to higher diesel fuel costs and increased third party carrier charges  which were primarily driven by more expensive diesel fuel

other expenses 
other expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  increased million  or  from million in the small increase was due to lower interest rate swap agreement income and deferred financing fees written off in connection with the early termination of our senior credit term loan of million 
this was offset by a decline in interest expense due to lower overall debt

our effective income tax rate was and for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
benefit from income taxes was million for the fiscal year ended december   compared to provision for income taxes of million in the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in the effective income tax rate was mainly due to the decrease in earnings before tax to a loss of million in from income of million in net loss income

units sold for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from units sold in mainly due to our strategic decision to consolidate and realign our current customer base 
looking at sales from a quarterly perspective first quarter net sales in increased approximately million  or  from net sales for the comparable period in the increase in first quarter net sales in was due to strong sales of bedding plants and shrubs throughout the sunbelt markets primarily as a result of favorable weather and our new market strategy 
however  net sales slowed at the end of the first quarter in as the gardening retailers continued their trend of better managing inventory levels by reducing pre spring stocking orders 
second quarter net sales in decreased approximately million  or  from net sales for the comparable period in the decline in second quarter net sales in was primarily isolated to the midwest and southeast markets where consumer demand for color products wavered as a result of excessive rain in may and june of compounding the effect of the decline in demand was the inability of two of our east coast facilities to transition perennial and annual color plant sales to new customers as part of a strategic decision to consolidate and realign our customer base 
third quarter net sales in decreased approximately million  or  from net sales for the comparable period in third quarter net sales in in the sunbelt markets increased million as strong spring like demand continued into july as a result of favorable weather and as we continued to focus on the merchandising of our products 
third quarter shrub sales in these regions also benefited from a successful joint marketing effort with a major customer 
third quarter net sales in the southeast declined million compared to the same period in mainly as a result of hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
fourth quarter net sales in increased approximately million  or  compared to the fourth quarter in as we began to see some early signs of recovery in the markets affected by the four hurricanes that hit the southeast region during the third quarter of in addition  our holiday crop sales in were up as a result of incremental store listings in the southeast

other operating loss 
other operating expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the decline was due to severance costs associated with the resignation of our former chief executive officer in february of  offset by legal fees of million incurred as a result of the lovell farms arbitration settlement

other expenses 
other expenses of million for the fiscal year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the decline in other expenses was mainly due to the million loss on debt extinguishment recognized during the third quarter of as a result of our refinancing 
the improvement was also due to the impact of the mark to market adjustment on our interest rate swap and a million decline in the amortization of deferred financing expenses  partially offset by higher interest expense 
for the fiscal year ended december   the mark to market adjustment amounted to income of million compared with income of million for the same period in interest expense increased to million in from million in due to our refinancing  which shifted more of our revolving debt to higher interest rate fixed term instruments in order to increase availability under our new revolving credit facility

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are funds generated by operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
the seasonal nature of our operations results in significant fluctuation in certain components of working capital primarily accounts receivable and inventory during the growing and selling cycles 
as a result  operating activities during the first and fourth quarters use significant amounts of cash  and in contrast  operating activities for the second and third quarters generate substantial cash as we ship inventory and collect accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was mainly due to lower earnings driven by lower gross profit and higher operating expenses 
in addition  net cash provided from the interest rate swap agreement decreased in by million compared to  due to the agreement maturing in february net cash used in working capital was primarily affected by the increase in inventory levels  partially offset by the decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in inventory for and the corresponding decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower net sales 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the increase in cash provided by investing activities was mainly due to the miami land sale for gross proceeds of approximately million 
in addition to this  we received million in option payments in related to the sale of our acre nursery property in vacaville  california 
these proceeds were partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures  discussed below 
our capital expenditures were million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to capital expenditures of million in the increase in capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended december  was mainly due to our increased investment in property and equipment as we prepared to transition production capacity from our irvine facility to our winters facility in northern california 
in we expect our capital expenditures to increase due to the land sales at our miami  florida and vacaville  california facilities 
the increase in capital expenditures is necessary to transition off of these properties to other facilities 
this is in addition to completing the transition of production capacity from our irvine  california facility to our winters facility 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the proceeds from the miami land sale were used to pay off the entire million outstanding balance of our term loan and approximately million to pay down our revolver and other expenses related to the sale 
we typically draw down our revolving credit facilities in the first and fourth quarters to fund our seasonal inventory buildup and seasonal operating expenses 
approximately of our sales occur in the first half of the year  generally allowing us to reduce borrowing under our revolving credit facilities in the second and third quarters 
on december   we had million of borrowings under our working capital revolver  resulting in unused borrowing capacity of million after applying the borrowing base limitations to our available borrowings 
at december   we had total indebtedness outstanding of million 
as previously mentioned  in we will receive gross proceeds of approximately million related to the sale of land in vacaville  california  which is incremental to the million we have already received as option payments 
the majority of the million will be used to fund the transition costs discussed above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing or any financial arrangements with related parties  other than operating leases 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years in millions revolving facility senior notes interest operating leases total we believe that cash generated by operations and from borrowings expected to be available under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following areas represent our most critical accounting policies related to actual results that may vary from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
sales with pay by scan arrangements are recognized when the products are sold by the retailers 
sales returns and allowances 
amounts accrued for sales returns and allowance are maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses in the trade receivable due to sales discounts and allowances 
the provision rate is established by management using the following criteria past sales returns experience  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the rate is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
provisions for sales discounts and allowances charged against income increase the allowance 
we record revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when the risk of ownership is transferred to the customer 
allowances are provided at the time revenue is recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level believed by management to adequately reflect the probable losses in the trade receivable due to customer defaults  insolvencies or bankruptcies 
the provision is established by management using the following criteria customer credit history  customer current credit rating and other relevant factors 
the provision is re evaluated on a quarterly basis 
provisions to bad debt expense charged against income increase the allowance 
all recoveries on trade receivables previously charged off are credited to the accounts receivable recovery account charged against income  while direct charge offs of trade receivables are deducted from the allowance 
accounting for goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this standard  goodwill has been classified as indefinite lived assets no longer subject to amortization 
indefinite lived assets are subject to impairment testing upon adoption of sfas no 
and at least annually thereafter 
we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this involves a two step process 
first  we must determine if the carrying amount of equity exceeds the fair value based upon the quoted market price of our common stock 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
the initial impairment analysis was completed in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of tax  to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill for the year ended december  we have recognized this impairment charge as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
upon completing the annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal  it was determined that a charge for impairment was not required 
accrued liabilities 
accrued liabilities include amounts accrued for expected claims costs relating to our insurance programs for workers compensation and auto liabilities 
we have large deductibles for these lines of insurance  which means we must pay the portion of each claim that falls below the deductible amount 
our expected claims costs are based on an actuarial analysis that considers our current payroll and automobile profile  recent claims history  insurance industry loss development factors and the deductible amounts 
we accrue our expected claims costs for each year on a ratable monthly basis with a corresponding charge against income 
management reviews the adequacy of the accruals at the end of each quarter 
the accruals for the expected costs relating to our insurance programs for workers compensation and auto liabilities are maintained at levels believed by our management to adequately reflect our probable claims obligations 
accounting pronouncements adopted in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations

 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this standard requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our ongoing business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not enter into transactions designed to mitigate market risks for trading or speculative purposes 
we have various debt instruments outstanding at december  that are impacted by changes in interest rates 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of our fixed and variable debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  the carrying amount and estimated fair value of our debt was million and million  respectively 
given the current balance of our variable rate debt  we estimate a change in interest costs of approximately million for every one percentage point change in applicable interest rates
