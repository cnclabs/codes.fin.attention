critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies  which are also described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by specific identification for new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and by the first in  first out method for tires  parts and accessories 
an allowance is provided when it is anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value 
other assets 
other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions and other intangible assets 
as stated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions in order to allocate goodwill to reporting units and to determine the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market condition  projected cash flows  interest rates and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires  in lieu of amortization  an annual impairment review of goodwill 
the company did not record an impairment charge related to the goodwill for its continuing operations as a result of its december  impairment review 
revenue recognition policies 
income on the sale of a vehicle or a piece of construction equipment is recognized when the customer executes a purchase contract with us  the unit has been delivered to the customer and there are no significant uncertainties related to financing or collectibility 
lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the related lease or rental agreement 
parts and service revenue is earned at the time the company sells the parts to its customers or at the time the company completes the service work order related to service provided to the customer s unit 
payments received on prepaid maintenance plans are deferred as a component of accrued expenses and recognized as income when the maintenance is performed 
finance and insurance revenue recognition 
finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized when the finance contract is sold to a finance company 
during  and  finance contracts were not retained by the company for any significant length of time because finance contracts are generally sold to finance companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit 
the majority of finance contracts are sold without recourse against the company 
a majority of the company s liability related to finance contracts sold with recourse is generally limited to to of the outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance company 
however  in the company instituted a finance program that accepts liability  with some restrictions  for the outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance company 
in order for a contract to be accepted into this finance program  a customer must meet strict credit requirements or maintain a significant equity position in the truck being financed  consequently  approximately of the company s portfolio balance related to finance contracts sold by the company are under this liability finance program and the company does not expect to finance a significant percentage of its truck sales under this liability finance program in the future 
the company provides for an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties that it may be liable for under finance contracts sold without recourse 
as part of the acquisition of certain assets of ats  the company assumed contingent liabilities to finance companies for notes that ats initiated on behalf of such finance companies related to the sale of trucks 
ats s portfolio to which the contingent liability relates is made up of contracts sold with and without recourse  and the company expects a majority of the portfolio to be liquidated by january  the company has provided a specific allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties related to ats s portfolio 
the company arranges financing for customers through various financial institutions and receives a commission from the lender equal to either the difference between the interest rates charged to customers over the predetermined interest rates set by the financing institution or a commission for the placement of contracts 
the company also receives commissions from the sale of various insurance products and extended service contracts to customers 
revenue is recognized by the company upon the sale of such finance and insurance contracts to the finance and insurance companies net of a provision for estimated repossession losses and interest charge backs 
the company is not the obligor under any of these contracts 
in the case of finance contracts  a customer may prepay  or fail to pay  thereby terminating the contract 
if the customer terminates a retail finance contract or insurance contract prior to scheduled maturity  a portion of the commissions previously paid to the company may be charged back to the company depending on the terms of the relevant contracts 
the estimate of ultimate charge back exposure is based on the company s historical charge back expense arising from similar contracts  including the impact of refinance and default rates on retail finance contracts and cancellation rates on insurance contracts 
the actual amount of historical charge backs has not been significantly different from the company s estimates 
insurance accruals 
the company is partially self insured for medical  workers compensation  and property and casualty insurance and calculates a reserve for those claims that have been incurred but not reported and for the remaining portion of those claims that have been reported 
the company uses information provided by third party administrators to determine the reasonableness of the calculations they perform 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provisions for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
the company recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes in certain states 
accordingly  the facts and financial circumstances impacting the state deferred income tax assets are reviewed quarterly and management s judgment is applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
additionally  despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax law  management believes that certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax contingencies 
the company s tax contingencies are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the company s income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that it considers appropriate  as well as related interest 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of the company s cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense at the time of resolution 
key performance indicator absorption rate 
the management of the company uses several performance metrics to evaluate the performance of its dealerships 
the company considers its absorption rate to be of critical importance 
absorption rate is calculated by dividing the gross profit from the parts  service and body shop departments by the overhead expenses of all of a dealership s departments  except for the selling expenses of the new and used truck departments and carrying costs of new and used truck inventory 
when absorption is achieved  then gross profit from the sale of a truck  after sales commissions and inventory carrying costs  directly impacts operating profit 
in  the company s absorption rate was approximately 
the company has made a concerted effort to increase its absorption rate since then 
management believes that maintaining an absorption rate in excess of is critical to the company s ability to generate consistent earnings in a cyclical business 
the company achieved a absorption rate in results of operations the following discussion and analysis includes the company s historical results of operations for  and the following table sets forth for the years indicated certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  new and used truck sales parts and service construction equipment sales lease and rental finance and insurance other total revenues cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income from continuing operations interest expense  net gain on sale of assets income before income taxes from continuing operations income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased million  or  from  million in to  million in sales of new and used trucks increased million  or  from million in to  million in unit sales of new class trucks increased  from  units in to  units in due to increasing demand and the ats acquisition 
the increase in class unit sales is being driven by the industry s need to replace aging equipment after us truck sales lagged behind the normal replacement cycle during   and the company s average sales price per class truck increased from  in to  in this price increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the manufacturing costs 
based on estimates from act research  the company believes that the sales of class trucks in the united states will increase from approximately  units in to approximately  units in in  the company retained a share of the us class truck sales market 
based on internal expansion and communication with our customers  the company expects to increase this share to approximately in  which would result in sale of approximately  class trucks based on retail sales of  units as estimated by act research 
industry expectations are for class truck sales to decline in primarily due to new diesel emissions laws  which are expected to increase the cost and reduce the fuel efficiency of diesel engines built on or after january  some industry experts believe that the drop off of truck sales in will begin to recover in the second half of act research currently estimates us class retail sales to total approximately  units in unit sales of new medium duty trucks increased  from  units in to  units in in  the company continued its concerted effort to improve its medium duty truck sales by adding experienced medium duty sales personnel and introducing new medium duty franchises at some of our rush truck centers to complement the existing medium duty lines sold at such dealerships 
during the last half of  the company made acquisitions of medium duty truck franchises in dallas and texarkana  texas  orlando  florida and fontana  california 
overall  new medium duty truck sales revenue increased million in compared to in  the company expects to continue to add medium duty franchises to certain dealerships and to increase medium duty sales and market share compared to the company expects to sell approximately  medium duty trucks in act research currently expects demand for class   and medium duty trucks to remain flat in and decrease approximately in unit sales of used trucks increased  from  units in to  units in used truck average revenue per unit increased by 
historically  used truck demand is consistent with new truck demand 
the company expects used truck demand to remain high  however  our ability to sell used trucks is ultimately dependent upon our ability to acquire used trucks for resale 
parts and service sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the parts and service sales increase in was due to business development activities combined with price increases for parts and labor and acquisitions throughout the year 
the company expects parts and service revenue to increase by approximately in sales of new and used construction equipment increased million  or  from million in to million in currently  the construction equipment sales increase is primarily attributable to the improved market conditions in houston  texas and the need to replace aging equipment 
approximately  units of construction equipment were put into use in our area of responsibility in  and the construction equipment industry expects to sell approximately  units of new construction equipment in the houston area in john deere s market share in the houston area construction equipment market increased from in to in the company believes it can increase john deere s market share  in the houston area  to approximately in because the company operates only one construction equipment location  new and used construction equipment revenue can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the mix of product sold and the timing of deliveries 
lease and rental revenues increased  from million in to million in the increase in truck lease and rental revenue was due to the increase in our customer base during the company expects lease and rental revenue to increase approximately during compared to in part due to the acquisition of units in the lease and rental fleet during the fourth quarter of finance and insurance revenues increased  from million in to million in finance and insurance revenues typically increase as sales of new and used trucks increase 
finance and insurance revenues have minimal direct costs and  therefore  contribute a disproportionate share of operating profits 
other income increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in other income revenue is primarily related to the gain on sale realized on trucks from the lease and rental fleet and commissions earned from john deere for direct manufacturer sales into our area of responsibility 
other income also consists of document fees related to truck sales and purchase discounts 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased from in to in this decrease is primarily a result of a change in our product mix 
truck sales  a lower margin revenue item  increased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in parts and service revenue  a higher margin revenue item  decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in to in gross margins on class truck sales decreased from in to in this decrease in gross margin is primarily a result of an increase in truck sales to large fleet customers in compared to large fleet sales typically result in lower margins than small fleet sales and sales to owner operators 
manufacturers incentives for class trucks accounted for of the gross margin in and in historically  manufacturers incentives have varied depending on market conditions and demand for class trucks 
the company expects margins to approximate those achieved in each year the company evaluates its reserve for new truck valuation losses 
the company did not record a loss provision in or gross margins on medium duty truck sales remained constant at in and manufacturers incentives for medium duty trucks accounted for of the gross margin in and we expect sales of lower margin class through models to continue to grow as a percentage of the total medium duty sales mix which will slightly decrease margins 
gross margins on used truck sales decreased from in to in margins on used trucks will vary depending on the mix of used trucks that are acquired from either owner operators or fleet owners at trade in 
used trucks acquired as trade ins from fleet owners normally result in lower margins when the truck is sold 
the current challenge for the used truck business is procuring a sufficient quantity of quality used trucks for resale at an acceptable price  in a market where demand is exceeding supply 
each year the company evaluates its reserve for used truck valuation losses 
the company recorded a  loss provision to the company s reserve for used truck valuation in and recognized a  loss provision during in  the company expects to maintain the margins achieved in gross margins from the company s parts  service and body shop operations increased from in to in gross profit dollars for the parts  service and body shop departments increased from million in to million in the company expects gross margins on parts  service and body shop revenue to approximate those achieved in gross margins on new and used construction equipment sales decreased from in to in the decrease was attributable to a change in the mix of products sold during the company expects gross margins on new and used construction equipment sales to be consistent with those achieved in and overall gross profit growth on new and used construction equipment sales to be directly correlated to sales growth 
gross profit generated from lease and rental sales decreased from in to in the decrease in gross margin from lease and rental sales is primarily due to the increase in interest rates and the increase in the cost of new trucks for use in the lease and rental fleet 
the company expects to maintain gross margins from lease and rental sales of approximately to for the company s policy is to depreciate its lease and rental fleet using the shortest depreciable life established by generally accepted accounting principles 
this policy results in the company realizing small gross margins while the unit is in service and a corresponding larger gain on sale when the unit is sold at the end of the lease term 
the increase in finance and insurance revenues and other income  as described above  has minimal direct cost and  therefore  contributes a disproportionate share of gross profit 
the company expects gross profit from finance and insurance sales and other income in to be directly related to truck revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase in sg a is attributable in part to increased commissions resulting from increased truck sales and the current year acquisitions

the company estimates that the implementation of statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r will increase our sg a expenses by approximately million in the company s management continually monitors sg a expenses 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in net interest expense increased as a result of increased floor plan interest rates  increased truck inventory and floor plan debt due to increased demand for trucks and the increased levels of indebtedness associated with the real estate acquired from ats and other real estate financings 
based on increased truck inventory and floor plan debt  the company expects net interest expense to increase to approximately million in income from continuing operations before income taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by million  or  from million in to million in  as a result of the factors described above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  and other relevant market rate or price risks 
the company is exposed to some market risk through interest rates related to our floor plan borrowing arrangements  variable rate debt and discount rates related to finance sales 
floor plan borrowings are based on the libor rate of interest and are used to meet working capital needs 
as of december   the company had floor plan borrowings of approximately million 
assuming an increase in the libor rate of interest of basis points  interest expense could increase by approximately million

the company provides all customer financing opportunities to various finance providers 
the company receives all finance charges in excess of a negotiated discount rate from the finance providers in the month following the date of the financing 
the negotiated discount rate is variable  thus subject to interest rate fluctuations 
this interest rate risk is mitigated by the company s ability to pass discount rate increases to customers through higher financing rates 
the company is also exposed to some market risk through interest rates related to the investment of our current cash and cash equivalents of million at december  these funds are generally invested in highly liquid money market accounts  government sponsored enterprises and corporate bonds that do not expose the company to a loss of principal 
as such instruments mature and the funds are reinvested  we are exposed to changes in market interest rates 
this risk is mitigated by management s ongoing evaluation of the best investment rates available for current and noncurrent high quality investments 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately and uniformly by basis points  the company s interest income could correspondingly increase or decrease by approximately million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
