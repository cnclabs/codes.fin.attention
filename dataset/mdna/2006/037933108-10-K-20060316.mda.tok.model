item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
apria operates in the home healthcare segment of the healthcare industry and provides services in the home respiratory therapy  home infusion therapy and home medical equipment areas 
in all three lines  apria provides patients with a variety of clinical and administrative support services and related products and supplies  most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan 
apria provides these services to patients in the home through approximately branch locations throughout the united states 
apria s branch locations are organized into geographic regions 
each region consists of a number of branches and a regional office that provides key administrative support services 
management evaluates operating results on a geographic basis and  therefore  views each region as an operating segment 
all regions provide the same products and services  including respiratory therapy  infusion therapy and home medical equipment and supplies 
additional administrative and operational support services are provided at a corporate level 
management continues to evaluate opportunities to gain efficiencies and cost savings by consolidating regional functions 
for financial reporting purposes  all the company s operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
strategy 
apria s mission is to be the first choice of patients and payors for their homecare needs 
apria has positioned itself in the marketplace as the low cost  quality provider of a broad range of home healthcare services to managed care customers and to medicare 
the specific elements of the company s strategy to achieve its mission and optimize its market position are as follows growth apria s primary focus is to restore strong organic sales growth following a decline in revenue during the third and fourth quarters of and to increase market share in its core service lines 
the company will continue to invest in service line extensions 
productivity apria continues to leverage its nationwide infrastructure to reduce costs by enhancing best practices and systems investments 
service apria differentiates itself from the competition by setting a high standard for customer service 
people apria recruits  develops and advances individuals who are leaders in order to respond to changing market conditions and to maximize sales and earnings growth 
critical accounting policies 
apria s management considers the accounting policies that govern revenue recognition and the determination of the net realizable value of accounts receivable to be the most critical in relation to the company s consolidated financial statements 
these policies require the most complex and subjective judgments of management 
additionally  the accounting policies related to goodwill  long lived assets and income taxes require significant judgment 
revenue and accounts receivable 
revenues are recognized on the date services and related products are provided to patients and are recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including private insurers  prepaid health plans  medicare and medicaid 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which apria operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts which provides for those accounts from which payment is not expected to be received  although services were provided and revenue was earned 
upon determination that an account is uncollectible  it is written off and charged to the allowance 
management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure that recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
management applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable aging to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age  accounts aged in excess of days are reserved at 
management establishes and monitors these percentages through analyses of historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends  the extent of contracted business and business combinations 
also considered are relevant business conditions such as governmental and managed care payor claims processing procedures and system changes 
if indicated by such analyses  management may periodically adjust the uncollectible estimate and corresponding percentages 
further  focused reviews of certain large and or problematic payors are performed to determine if overall reserve levels are sufficient 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate the potential for impairment 
also  management tests for impairment of its intangible assets and long lived assets on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
apria s goodwill impairment test is conducted at a reporting unit level and compares each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the company has determined that its geographic regions are reporting units under sfas no 
the measurement of fair value for each region is based on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows and is further tested using a multiple of earnings approach 
in projecting its reporting units cash flows  management considers industry growth rates and trends  known and potential reimbursement reductions  cost structure changes and local circumstances specific to a region 
based on its tests and reviews  no impairment of its goodwill  intangible assets or other long lived assets existed at december  however  future events or changes in current circumstances could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets 
should an asset be deemed impaired  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated fair market value 
income taxes 
apria provides for income taxes in accordance with provisions specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
these differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future  based on tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
in making an assessment regarding the probability of realizing a benefit from these deductible differences  management considers the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  tax planning strategies and the length of carryforward periods 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
clinical expense reclassification 
certain respiratory therapy and infusion therapy nursing expenses  which were previously presented in the selling  distribution and administrative line  are now included in cost of net revenues 
this change was made in response to a request made by the securities and exchange commission accounting staff 
the respiratory therapy and infusion therapy nursing expenses that have been reclassified to cost of net revenues are comprised primarily of employee salary and benefit costs and fees paid to contracted workers who are deployed to service a patient 
apria s respiratory therapy and infusion therapy nursing personnel are also engaged in a number of administrative and marketing tasks  and accordingly  the related costs remain classified within selling  distribution and administrative expenses 
apria adopted the classification described above in infusion therapy nursing expenses for and have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  however the respiratory therapy expenses remain in the selling distribution and administrative line for and during those years  the data was not captured in sufficient detail to make a corresponding reclassification 
the following table sets forth a summary of the current classification of respiratory therapy and infusion therapy nursing expenses in dollars and percentages of net revenues year ended december  in thousands cost of net revenues    selling  distribution and administrative   total clinical expenses   the amounts in the table above are exclusive of the nursing costs associated with a small ancillary nursing service business that are currently  and were previously  presented within the cost of net revenues line 
such costs totaled   and  for  and  respectively 
results of operations net revenues 
net revenues were  million in   million in and  million in growth rates were and in and  respectively 
the growth rate in was impacted by medicare reimbursement reductions that went into effect january  for respiratory drugs and certain durable medical equipment items 
an additional reduction on oxygen and oxygen equipment  with an initial effective date of january   was delayed until april  the combined reduction totaled million in the transition out of the gentiva carecentrix inc contract  that commenced in  continued into the first half of which resulted in an incremental revenue reduction of million 
adding back these reductions  along with million in aggregate pricing reductions in three major managed care contracts  the revenue increase in would have been 
based on certain assumptions and its analysis  apria management estimates that acquisitions contributed approximately million in net revenues in in addition to the pricing reduction noted above that was isolated for three of the company s large contracts  pricing compression within the overall managed care payor sector was a prime factor for the slow revenue growth  especially within the home medical equipment other and respiratory medications lines 
growth in the respiratory oxygen and enteral lines  however  remained strong 
revenue growth in was negatively affected by the medicare reimbursement reduction for respiratory medications that went into effect january  also  revenues in that period declined as apria transitioned out of the gentiva carecentrix inc contract which management chose not to renew for due to pricing differences 
the effect in of the medicare reduction was million and the reduction in revenues as a result of the gentiva transition was million 
revenues generated from acquisitions were estimated at million in apria expects to continue to face pricing pressures from medicare as well as from its managed care customers as these payors seek to lower costs by obtaining more favorable pricing from providers such as apria 
managed care organizations are also evaluating alternative delivery models for certain products and services  which include those provided by apria 
this potential change may cause apria to provide reduced levels of certain products and services in the future  resulting in a corresponding reduction in revenue 
the company recently signed a new three year contract with cigna health corporation  effective february  which is estimated to contribute approximately million in net revenues in apria had previously serviced cigna members under a subcontracting arrangement with gentiva prior to further  given apria s high volume of managed care business  it is well positioned among its competitors with respect to the medicare advantage plan expansion 
see medicare reimbursement 
the following table sets forth a summary of net revenues by service line year ended december  in thousands home respiratory therapy    home infusion therapy    home medical equipment other    total net revenues    respiratory therapy 
respiratory therapy revenues are derived primarily from the provision of oxygen systems  home ventilators  sleep apnea equipment  nebulizers  respiratory medications and related services 
revenues from the respiratory therapy service line increased in by when compared to and increased by in when compared to the medicare reimbursement reduction for respiratory medications and oxygen and oxygen equipment caused declines of and in revenues for and  respectively 
declines in the respiratory medications line had the greatest impact on the overall respiratory growth rate 
revenues from the medications line declined in by  or on a pre medicare reduction basis 
revenues from oxygen and oxygen equipment increased by  or on a pre medicare reduction basis 
acquisitions of respiratory businesses accounted for most of the growth in the respiratory therapy revenue line 
infusion therapy 
the infusion therapy service line involves the administration of drugs or nutrients directly into the body intravenously through a needle or catheter 
infusion therapy services also include administering enteral nutrients directly into the gastrointestinal tract through a feeding tube 
infusion therapy revenues increased in versus and in when compared to growth in enteral nutrition  one of the strongest contributors in the infusion line  grew by in and in the enteral nutrition growth rate was negatively impacted by the gentiva contract exit 
excluding enteral nutrition  revenues for the remainder of the infusion line have been virtually flat during the to period 
home medical equipment other 
home medical equipment other revenues are derived from the provision of equipment to assist patients with ambulation  safety and general care in and around the home 
home medical equipment other revenues decreased by in and increased by in diabetic supplies grew in when compared to this growth is directly attributable to the march acquisition of a company that entered the diabetic supply market just prior to being acquired by apria 
excluding the growth in diabetic supplies  home medical equipment other revenue experienced a decline in when compared to medicare reimbursement reductions implemented in that impacted this line of business totaled approximately million 
additionally  hospital utilization rates for many of the company s managed care contractors were down in the last half of  which served to further depress growth in home medical equipment other revenues 
medicare reimbursement 
there are a number of provisions contained within recent legislation or proposed legislation that affect or may affect medicare reimbursement policies for items and services provided by apria 
such provisions are outlined below in the chronological order of the associated legislation 
still pending from the balanced budget act of is the streamlined authority granted to the us department of health and human services  or hhs  to increase or reduce the reimbursement for home medical equipment  including oxygen  by up to each year under an inherent reasonableness authority 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  issued a rule that established a process by which such adjustments may be made 
the rule applies to all medicare part b services except those paid under a physician fee schedule  a prospective payment system  or a competitive bidding program 
as of this date  neither cms nor the durable medical equipment regional carriers have used the expedited authority 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  also referred to as the medicare modernization act  became law 
the provisions contained therein which are significant to apria are as follows a freeze on annual payment increases for durable medical equipment the freeze commenced in and will continue through reimbursement reductions for five durable medical equipment categories  including oxygen reimbursement for most of these categories is based on the median price paid for such items on behalf of beneficiaries of federal employee health benefit plans  or fehbp 
the new fee schedules for most products went into effect january  the revised pricing for oxygen and oxygen equipment was implemented on april  any claims for oxygen and oxygen equipment that had been submitted prior to the implementation of the new fee schedule were paid based on pricing schedules and were not retroactively adjusted 
reimbursement reduction for inhalation drugs the previous reimbursement rate of of the average wholesale price was reduced to of the average wholesale price  effective january  beginning in january  reimbursement for these drugs was further reduced through a shift to the manufacturer reported average sales price subject to adjustment each quarter plus  plus a separate dispensing fee per patient episode 
the dispensing fees for were for a day supply of medications and for a day supply 
in its final physician fee schedule released on november   cms established an initial dispensing fee of for a day supply for a new patient  and for each day supply thereafter 
the day dispensing fee has been lowered to 
establishment of a competitive bidding program for part b such a program would require that suppliers wishing to provide certain items to beneficiaries submit bids to medicare 
the program  for as yet unspecified durable medical equipment items and services  is to be phased in as follows i of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in  ii of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in  and iii additional areas after the legislation contains special provisions for rural areas 
in september  cms issued its proposed quality standards for the program  to which apria provided written comments 
the final standards are expected to be published by cms later in incentives for expansion of medicare part c the medicare modernization act includes financial incentives for managed care plans to expand their provision of medicare advantage plans in in a stated effort to attract more medicare beneficiaries to managed care models 
the company maintains contracts to provide respiratory  infusion and medical equipment and related services to a significant number of managed care plans nationwide  and believes that the medicare advantage expansion represents a growth opportunity starting in reimbursement for home infusion therapy under medicare part d currently  a limited number of infusion therapies  supplies and equipment are covered by medicare part b 
the medicare modernization act provides expanded coverage for drugs only  but excludes coverage for the supplies and clinical services needed to safely and effectively provide home infusion therapy services to patients in the home 
in the fourth quarter of  the company contracted with a limited number of medicare part d prescription drug plans in order to provide continuity of care for existing medicare medicaid dual eligible patients in due to nationwide part d implementation issues experienced by home infusion providers in early  the industry is continuing to work with cms to rectify the coverage and payment policies that are causing implementation challenges 
revenue reductions resulting from the provisions of the medicare modernization act are estimated by apria management as follows the revision to inhalation drug reimbursement in resulted in a revenue reduction of approximately million from levels 
in  pretax income was reduced from levels by nearly million as a result of the lower medicare pricing implemented in and related product pricing increases imposed by drug manufacturers 
in  the revision to the dispensing fee is estimated to reduce revenues by approximately million 
the impact of the competitive bidding program and the medicare part c and d programs cannot be estimated at this time 
the deficit reduction act of was signed into law by the president in february provisions that will impact reimbursement to apria are summarized as follows in  durable medical equipment currently categorized in the rent to cap category by cms  such as hospital beds  wheelchairs  nebulizers  patient lifts and continuous positive airway pressure devices  will be considered purchased outright at the end of the rental period and the ownership of such devices will transfer directly to the patients 
the rental period  which had been months with an option for the patients to purchase the equipment  will be reduced to months 
the new month rental period began on january   and therefore the first month in which the new policy will impact the company s revenue is february in addition  the bi annual service and maintenance fee that had been paid to suppliers after the rental period ended  will be eliminated 
suppliers will have the option of billing medicare for any repairs and maintenance performed on the patient owned equipment 
the act authorizes the secretary of hhs to establish service and or maintenance fees that at this time cannot be estimated or assured 
it is  however  unlikely that apria will continue in the repair and maintenance business 
reimbursement for oxygen will convert from an ongoing rental method to a rent to purchase 
the act mandates that oxygen equipment reimbursement will be limited to months  after which time the ownership of the equipment will transfer to the patient  who will assume all responsibility for identifying when repairs or preventive maintenance are needed 
providers would continue to be reimbursed for delivering portable oxygen to those patients who require it 
the act applies to patients who were on service with suppliers from january  forward 
accordingly  the first month in which the new policy will impact the company is january the act authorizes the secretary of hhs to establish service and or maintenance fees that at this time cannot be estimated or assured 
due to the bundled nature of the existing payment method  which includes the reimbursement for contents  all applicable clinical  delivery  after hours  billing collection and other patient support services  the industry will work with cms and the secretary to establish fair and equitable fee schedules for such non equipment services 
the net impact of the changes cannot be estimated at this time 
the president s current budget proposal contains a provision to further reduce the monthly rental period for oxygen from the now mandated months to months 
no further information is available on the proposal and it is uncertain whether this provision will remain in the budget that is ultimately approved by congress 
medicaid reimbursement 
in  some states began adopting alternative pricing methodologies for certain drugs and biologicals under the medicaid program 
in at least states  the changes reduced the level of reimbursement received by apria without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred 
in several of those states  apria elected to stop accepting new medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs and biologicals 
apria will continue  however  to provide services to patients already on service  and for those who receive other medicaid covered respiratory  home medical equipment or infusion therapies  if the reimbursement levels for those services remain adequate 
further  in  some states implemented other payment policy changes or changed coverage criteria for medical equipment  enteral and infusion therapy altogether 
currently  other states are considering reductions in medicaid reimbursement as they work through their respective state s budget process 
apria management cannot predict the outcome of such budget negotiations and whether other states will consider reductions as well 
gross profit 
gross margins were in  in and in the reported margins include the effects of reclassifying certain respiratory therapy and infusion therapy nursing expenses from the selling  distribution and administration line 
excluding this impact  the margin declined by between and and by 
between and the declines are primarily due to the medicare reimbursement reductions  managed care revenue pricing reductions and the effects of the non renewal of the gentiva contract in further eroding the gross margin in is a manufacturer s price increase for a particular respiratory drug  effected concurrently with higher government reimbursement for that drug 
this price increase is estimated to have a million negative impact on apria s gross margin for mitigating some of the negative pressure on the gross margin in was a decrease in depreciation expense  which is due to the decrease in patient service equipment expenditures 
see clinical expense reclassification 
provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimate of the net realizable value of accounts receivable after considering actual write offs of specific receivables 
accounts receivable estimated to be uncollectible are provided for by applying specific percentages to each receivables aging category  which is determined by the number of days the receivable is outstanding 
for  and  the provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net revenues was  and  respectively 
the slight improvement in versus is due to strong cash collections  particularly in the fourth quarter 
the improvement in when compared to is also attributable to strong cash collections and a lower allowance requirement indicated by the company s analysis of subsequent realization data 
selling  distribution and administrative 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses incurred in direct support of operations and those associated with administrative functions 
expenses incurred by the operating locations include salaries and other expenses in the following functional areas selling  distribution  intake  reimbursement  warehousing and repair 
many of these operating costs are directly variable with revenue growth patterns 
some are also very sensitive to market driven price fluctuations such as facility lease and fuel costs 
the administrative expenses include overhead costs incurred by the operating locations and corporate support functions 
these expenses do not fluctuate with revenue growth as closely as operating costs 
certain clinical expenses previously classified in this line have been reclassified to cost of net revenues 
selling  distribution and administrative expenses  expressed as percentages of net revenues  were in  in and in these reported percentages include the effects of reclassifying certain respiratory therapy and infusion therapy nursing expenses to cost of net revenues 
excluding this impact  the selling  distribution and administrative percentage increased in approximately half of this increase is attributable to the lower revenues resulting from the medicare and managed care pricing changes noted above without a corresponding reduction in the company s actual cost of providing those products and services 
higher fuel prices and vehicle maintenance expenditures  rising medical benefit costs and outsourced collection fees also factored into the increase 
advertising costs related to the company s diabetic supply business also increased year to year as a result of the company s entry into this market late in the first quarter of other incremental costs include severance charges related to the departure of two executives and a reduction in workforce at the corporate office  both in the first quarter of  and the departure of three executives during the fourth quarter of see clinical expense reclassification 
qui tam settlement and related costs 
as previously reported  apria was the subject of an investigation launched in mid by the us attorney s office in los angeles and the us department of health and human services 
the investigation concerned the documentation supporting apria s billing for services provided to patients whose healthcare costs were paid by medicare and other federal programs 
the investigation related to two civil qui tam lawsuits against apria filed by individuals suing on behalf of the government 
apria and representatives of the government and the individual plaintiffs reached a preliminary agreement in early august to settle these lawsuits for the aggregate sum of million  without any admission of wrongdoing by apria 
the settlement was finalized in a definitive agreement that was fully executed and became effective on september   and apria paid the settlement amount on that date 
apria also incurred million in legal fees and other related costs 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in  million in and million in the increase in amortization expense in and  when compared to  is directly attributable to the increased level of acquisition activity in and continued fast pace in see liquidity and capital resources business combinations 
interest expense and income and write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily attributable to the increase in long term debt incurred to repurchase million of apria s common stock 
the increase in base interest rates during also contributed to the increase 
interest expense was higher in  when compared to  due to the impact of a full year of interest on the million convertible senior notes that were issued in august the interest increases were partially offset by interest reductions resulting from a decrease in borrowings under the credit agreement due to scheduled principal amortization payments and by the expiration in march of two interest rate swap agreements that had fixed interest at higher rates on a portion of apria s debt 
in  the company wrote off million in unamortized debt issuance costs in conjunction with the november refinancing of the company s bank loans 
see liquidity and capital resources long term debt and treasury stock 
income tax expense 
income taxes were million in  which reflects a higher rate resulting from the portion of the settlement of two qui tam lawsuits that was non deductible for tax purposes 
this increase was offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance and a corresponding reduction of the tax provision that was recorded in the first quarter of and by a decrease from the release of state tax contingencies due to a change in estimate during the fourth quarter of income taxes were million and million for and  respectively  and were provided at the effective tax rates expected to be applicable for each year 
apria utilized million of federal net operating loss carryforwards in the remaining federal net operating loss carryforwards of million expired unused on december  additionally  at december   the company had various apportioned state net operating loss carryforwards of million  net of federal tax benefit 
the company believes it has adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
at december   million  net of tax benefit  was accrued for such federal  state and local tax matters and is included in income taxes payable 
although not probable  the most adverse resolution of these federal  state and local issues could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods in addition to the million currently provided 
based upon a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a material adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial condition 
inflation 
apria experiences pricing pressures in the form of continued reductions in reimbursement rates  particularly from managed care organizations and from governmental payors such as medicare and medicaid 
the company is also impacted by rising costs for certain inflation sensitive operating expenses such as labor and employee benefits  facility and equipment leases  and vehicle fuel 
liquidity and capital resources apria s principal source of liquidity is its operating cash flow  which is supplemented by a million revolving credit facility 
in recent years  apria has generated operating cash flows in excess of its operating needs  which has afforded it the ability to pursue acquisitions and fund patient service equipment purchases to support revenue growth 
apria s management believes that its operating cash flow will continue to be sufficient to fund its operations and growth strategies 
however  in late  apria drew upon its revolving credit facility for the million common stock repurchase  in  the company may repurchase an additional million of its stock  and in september  the holders of the million convertible senior notes will have an opportunity to require apria to repurchase some or all of the notes 
accordingly  apria management has begun to explore financing alternatives 
further  apria has initiated a project to implement a new enterprise wide system 
the overall objective of the project is to deliver the necessary technology and automation across the organization to enable service improvements  productivity and access to information 
management is currently in the system selection phase and expects to progress to initial phases of development later in cash expenditures for  which include related infrastructure upgrades and software development costs  are estimated in the million to million range 
the total cost of the project will be determined once a system selection has been made and the project planning is completed 
cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the decrease in operating cash flow in is due primarily to the medicare reimbursement reductions and related product cost increases  the qui tam lawsuit settlement and related fees  and a million increase in tax payments between the periods 
the increase in  when compared to  is largely due to the increase in net income before items not requiring cash and the timing of disbursements processed against accounts payable and other accruals 
these items were partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable in than in  which resulted from acquisition activity 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
changes between the periods in the level of business combinations executed directly impact this line 
the reduction in purchases of patient service and other equipment in is directly attributable to controls placed on inventory and purchasing 
cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to a use of cash of million in financing activities provided cash of million in in  the company borrowed from its revolving credit facility to repurchase million worth of its common stock 
excluding this repurchase  the company would have had a reduction in long term debt of million 
cash used in primarily relates to a million stock repurchase and scheduled principal payments made against term loans prior to the november refinancing 
cash provided in reflects net proceeds received upon the issuance of million of convertible senior notes 
also  the company repurchased a total of million of its common stock in  million of which was purchased with the convertible note proceeds 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes apria s long term cash payment obligations to which the company is contractually bound for the year ending december  in millions total revolving loan convertible senior notes capital lease obligations other debt operating leases deferred acquisition payments total contractual cash obligations accounts receivable 
accounts receivable before allowance for doubtful accounts increased to million at december  from million at the same date in days sales outstanding calculated as of each period end by dividing accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  by the day rolling average of net revenues were days at december  compared to at december  the increase in days sales outstanding is a result of the decrease in net revenues for the fourth quarter or last days of  when compared to the same period at the end of  without a corresponding decrease in the accounts receivable balance 
accounts aged in excess of days of total receivables for certain major payor categories  and in total  are as follows december  december  total medicare medicaid self pay managed care other unbilled receivables 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
delays  ranging from a day up to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from date of service and are considered in apria s analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
the higher unbilled amount at december  is largely due to acquisitions effected during the time consuming processes of converting patient files onto apria s systems and obtaining provider numbers from governmental payors routinely delay billing of the newly acquired business 
inventories and patient service equipment 
inventories consist primarily of pharmaceuticals and disposable products used in conjunction with patient service equipment 
patient service equipment consists of respiratory and home medical equipment that is provided to in home patients for the course of their care plan  normally on a rental basis  and subsequently returned to apria for redistribution after cleaning and maintenance is performed 
the branch locations serve as the primary point from which inventories and patient service equipment are delivered to patients 
certain products and services  such as infusion therapy and respiratory medications  bypass the branches and are provided directly to patients from pharmacies or other central locations 
the branches are supplied with inventory and equipment from central warehouses that service specific areas of the country 
such warehouses are also responsible for repairs and scheduled maintenance of patient service equipment  which adds to the frequent movement of equipment between locations 
further  the majority of apria s patient service equipment is located in patients homes 
while utilization varies widely between equipment types  on the average  approximately of equipment is on rent at any given time 
inherent in this asset flow is the fact that losses will occur 
management has successfully instituted a number of controls over the company s inventories and patient service equipment to minimize such losses 
depending on the product type  the company performs physical inventories on an annual or quarterly basis 
inventory and patient service equipment balances in the financial records are adjusted to reflect the results of these physical inventories 
inventory and patient service equipment losses for  and  were  million  and million  respectively 
long term debt 
apria s credit agreement with bank of america and a syndicate of lenders consists of a million revolving credit facility that has a maturity date of november  the senior secured credit agreement permits apria to select one of two variable interest rates 
one option is the base rate  which is expressed as the higher of a the federal funds rate plus or b the bank of america prime rate 
the other option is the eurodollar rate  which is based on the london interbank offered rate 
interest on outstanding balances under the senior secured credit agreement is determined by adding a margin to the eurodollar rate or base rate in effect at each interest calculation date 
the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility is based on apria s debt rating as determined by standard and poor s ratings services or moody s investor services with respect to the credit facility 
the applicable margin ranges from to for eurodollar loans and from zero to for base rate loans 
the senior credit agreement also requires payment of commitment fees ranging from to also based on apria s debt rating on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the effective interest rate at december   after consideration of the effect of the swap agreements described below  was 
see hedging activities 
in november  standard and poor s ratings services downgraded its rating on apria s bank debt from bbb to bb 
the effect of this action was to increase the applicable margin from to and to increase the commitment fee on the unused line from 
to  in accordance with the bank credit agreement 
in march  moody s investor services announced that they placed apria under review for possible downgrade 
should the outcome of such review result in a downgrade  it is not expected to have a further impact on apria s interest rates 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of apria 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by the credit agreement 
on december  outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility were million 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million and credit available under the revolving facility was million 
convertible senior notes 
in august  apria issued convertible senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million under an indenture between apria and us bank national association 
the notes were issued in a private placement at an issue price of  per note of the principal amount at maturity and were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission 
the notes will mature on september   unless earlier converted  redeemed or repurchased by apria 
apria may redeem some or all of the notes at any time after september  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and contingent interest  if any  to the redemption date 
the holders of the notes may require apria to repurchase some or all of the notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  up to but excluding the applicable repurchase date  initially on september   and subsequently on september of    and  or at any time prior to their maturity following a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture 
any notes that apria is required to repurchase will be paid for in cash  pursuant to the terms of a december amendment to the indenture which eliminated the company s option to pay part of the repurchase price in shares of common stock 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per year
