item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we experience lower gross and operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions 
additionally  our quarterly results also may be materially and adversely affected by the timing and volume of work under contract  regional or general economic conditions  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  
table of contents a change in the demand for our services caused by severe weather conditions  increases in construction and design costs  the termination of existing agreements  losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance  a change in the mix of our customers  contracts and business  payment risk associated with the financial condition of our customers  changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing and new agreements  costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise  the timing of acquisitions  and the timing and magnitude of acquisition integration costs 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year 
an economic downturn may lead to less demand for our services 
because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries  a downturn in any of those industries would adversely affect our results of operations 
the telecommunications and utility markets experienced substantial change during and as evidenced by an increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunications market  continued devaluation of many of our customers debt and equity securities and pricing pressures resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants 
these factors contributed to the delay and cancellation of projects and reduction of capital spending  which impacted our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels 
a number of other factors  including financing conditions for and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve  could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services 
in addition  consolidation  competition or capital constraints in the electric power  gas  telecommunications or cable television industries may result in reduced spending by  or the loss of  one or more of our customers 
our industry is highly competitive 
our industry is served by numerous small  owner operated private companies  a few public companies and several large regional companies 
in addition  relatively few barriers prevent entry into some of our industries 
as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
competition in the industry depends on a number of factors  including price 
certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than we are able to provide 
in addition  some of our competitors have greater resources than we do 
we cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services 
similarly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industry or maintain a customer base at current levels 
we also may face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers 
electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television service providers usually employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services we do 
we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future 
we may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth 
our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by  among other factors  our ability to expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs  attract new customers  increase the number of projects performed for existing customers  hire and retain qualified employees  and open additional facilities 

table of contents in addition  our customers may reduce the number or size of projects available to us due to their inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided 
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control  and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth 
if we are unsuccessful  we may not be able to achieve internal growth  expand our operations or grow our business 
our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  several estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities  revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting and provision for income taxes 
actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are self insured against potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile  general liability  workers compensation and employers liability  those policies are subject to deductibles of million to million per occurrence  and we are primarily self insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible 
we also maintain a non union employee related health care benefit plan that is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  with assistance from a third party actuary 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in a given period 
our casualty insurance carrier for prior periods is experiencing financial distress  which may require us to make payments for losses that otherwise would be insured 
our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from august  to february  is experiencing financial distress  but is currently paying valid claims 
in the event that this insurer s financial situation deteriorates  we may be required to pay certain obligations that otherwise would have been paid by this insurer 
we estimate that the total future claim amount that this insurer is currently obligated to pay on our behalf for the above mentioned policy periods is approximately million  however  our estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts is between million and million 
the actual amounts ultimately paid by us related to these claims  if any  may vary materially from the above range and could be impacted by further claims development and the extent to which the insurer can not honor its obligations 
in any event  we do not expect any failure by this insurer to honor its obligations to us to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  however  the impact could be material to our results of operations or cash flow in a given period 
we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters 
our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions  we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future 
claims for damages to persons  including claims for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs 
table of contents and liabilities 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time  our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein  a significant portion of our revenues is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost method 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
this accounting method is standard for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives 
penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which generally is during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that such adjustments could be significant 
our dependence upon fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business 
we currently generate  and expect to continue to generate  a portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
we must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed price contracts 
the cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we extend credit to customers for purchases of our services  and in the past we have had  and in the future we may have  difficulty collecting receivables from major customers that have filed bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial difficulties 
we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include electric power and gas companies  telecommunications and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors  and builders  owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states 
consequently  we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the united states 
our customers in the telecommunications business have experienced significant financial difficulties and in several instances have filed for bankruptcy 
a number of our utility customers are also experiencing business challenges in the current business climate 
if additional major customers file for bankruptcy or continue to experience financial difficulties  or if anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided 
in addition  material changes in any of our customer s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 
the industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services we provide 
the electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of technological advances that could  in certain cases  reduce the demand for our services or otherwise negatively impact our business 
new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for voice  video and data transmissions  and improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunications and cable television companies to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
a portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds 
we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds 
surety market conditions currently are difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding 
table of contents capacity is available in the market and terms have become more expensive and restrictive 
we have posted letters of credit in the amount of million to support our surety bond program and have granted security interests in various of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
current or future market conditions  as well as changes in our surety s assessment of our operating and financial risk  could cause our surety provider to decline to issue or renew  or substantially reduce the amount of  bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs 
these actions could be taken on short notice 
if our surety provider were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties  finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance  such as letters of credit or cash 
we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
accordingly  if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity  we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects 
many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice  and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts if they are cancelled or as they are completed or expire 
we could experience a decrease in our revenue  net income and liquidity if any of the following occur our customers cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  we complete a significant number of non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects  or we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenue 
many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice  typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
certain of our customers assign work to us on a project by project basis under master service agreements 
under these agreements  our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us 
our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us 
many of our contracts  including our master service agreements  are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re bid 
the departure of key personnel could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of the businesses we acquire 
although we have entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our unionized workforce could adversely affect our operations and our ability to complete future acquisitions 
as of december   approximately of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future 
strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
in addition  our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons 
for instance  our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based company 
our business is labor intensive  and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ  train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an 
table of contents adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
for instance  we may experience shortages of qualified journeyman linemen 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel 
labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues 
our business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate management infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand 
future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management  including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives 
to the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management  we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
in such cases  these objects may rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
in such circumstances  we may be liable for fines and damages  and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information 
in addition  we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture  resulting in the release of subsurface materials 
these subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which are above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in certain instances  we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties including predecessors or lessors for such cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities 
however  such third party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs  and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities  or future obligations and liabilities  may have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 
further  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
while only a small percentage of our revenue is currently derived from international markets  we hope to continue to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally 
we presently conduct our international sales efforts in canada  mexico and selected countries overseas  but expect that the number of countries that we operate in could expand significantly over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts may adversely affect the global economy  our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements  currency fluctuations in foreign countries  and complex foreign laws and treaties 
these risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business profitably 
opportunities within the government arena could lead to increased governmental regulation applicable to us and unrecoverable start up costs 
most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
as we pursue increased opportunities in the government arena  management s focus 
table of contents associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities 
if we were to be successful in being awarded government contracts  a significant amount of costs could be required before any revenues were realized from these contracts 
in addition  as a government contractor  we would be subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities  any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business 
government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
government agencies may review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if government agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts  they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs 
if government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  if the government were to even allege improper activity  we also could experience serious harm to our reputation 
many government contracts must be appropriated each year 
if appropriations are not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts 
we may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of has introduced many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting  including the requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to this report 
during  we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements 
as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective  however  there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and other publicly traded securities  the reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of customers  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth 
if we cannot secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms  we may be unable to support our growth strategy 
we cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services or the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts 
using cash for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt  and if we seek more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility 
when we seek additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future 
we cannot be sure that we will successfully integrate our acquired companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
if we do not implement proper overall business controls  our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could be adversely affected 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special risks which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  diversion of our management s attention from operational matters  difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies  risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  and potential disruptions of our business 
if one of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems  the reputation of our entire company could suffer 

table of contents factors beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy  which may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy 
our business strategy includes increasing our market share and presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we expect to face competition for acquisition opportunities  and some of our competitors may have greater financial resources or access to financing on more favorable terms than us 
this competition may limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence or the issuance of securities 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
when we acquire a business  we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire 
through december   pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  we amortized this goodwill over its estimated useful life of years following the acquisition  which directly impacted our earnings 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
 which we adopted in  also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas no 
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow  market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter 
future impairments  if any  will be recognized as operating expenses 
our convertible subordinated notes are presently convertible 
as a result of our common stock satisfying the market price condition of the convertible subordinated notes during the fourth quarter of  the notes are presently convertible at the option of each holder 
we have the right to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a conversion of the notes 
the conversion period will expire on march   but may resume upon the satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions in future periods 
the number of shares issuable upon a conversion of the notes will be determined based on a conversion rate of approximately per share 
in the event that all notes were converted for common stock  we would issue an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of our convertible subordinated notes into our common stock could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the possibility that the notes may be converted may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
if we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash  the amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be determined by the product of the number of shares issuable at a conversion rate of approximately per share multiplied by the average closing price of our common stock during a day trading period following the conversion of the notes 
to the extent that the average closing price of our common stock during this period exceeds per share  we will be required to pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted 
you are unlikely to be able to seek remedies against arthur andersen llp  our former independent auditor 
our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended prior to december  were audited by arthur andersen llp  our former independent auditor 
in june  arthur andersen llp was convicted of federal obstruction of justice charges in connection with its destruction of documents 
as a result 
table of contents of its conviction  arthur andersen llp ceased operations 
although the us supreme court overturned arthur andersen llp s conviction in may  the firm has not resumed operations 
you will not be able to recover against arthur andersen llp for its liability under section of the securities act in the event any untrue statements of a material fact are contained in its previously issued audit reports 
even if you have a basis for asserting a remedy against  or seeking to recover from arthur andersen llp  because they have ceased operations  it is highly unlikely that you would be able to recover damages from arthur andersen llp 
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as our stockholder rights plan and delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  we are subject to provisions of delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder  and we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors or permitted by the stockholder rights plan
