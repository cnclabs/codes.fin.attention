item a 
risk factors the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
risks due to investment in real estate decreased revenues or increased operating expenses may cause decreased yields from an investment in real property 
real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from investments in real estate depend upon the amount of revenues generated and expenses incurred 
if properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our results from operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy  market rental rates and expenses 
these factors consequently can have an impact on revenues from the properties and their underlying values 
the financial results and labor decisions of major local employers may also have an impact on the revenues from and value of certain properties 
other factors may further adversely affect revenues from and values of our properties 
these factors include the general economic climate  local conditions in the areas in which properties are located such as an oversupply of apartment units or a reduction in the demand for apartment units  the attractiveness of the properties to residents  competition from other multifamily communities and our ability to provide adequate facilities maintenance  services and amenities 
our revenues would also be adversely affected if residents were unable to pay rent or we were unable to rent apartments on favorable terms 
if we were unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for a significant number of apartment units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting were significantly lower than expected rates  then our funds from operations would  and our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt may  be adversely affected 
there is also a risk that as leases on the properties expire  residents will vacate or enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us 
operating costs  including real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  and mortgage payments  if any  do not  in general  decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a property 
we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the property  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we were unable to meet our mortgage payments 
in addition  applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing also affect revenues from properties and real estate values 
if we are unable to implement our growth strategy  or if we fail to identify  acquire or integrate new acquisitions  our results may suffer 
our future growth will be dependent upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify acceptable properties for development and acquisition  complete acquisitions and developments on favorable terms  successfully integrate acquired and newly developed properties  and obtain financing to support expansion 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy  that growth will continue at historical levels or at all  or that any expansion will improve operating results 
the failure to identify  acquire and integrate new properties effectively could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
development and construction projects may not be completed or completed successfully 
as a general matter  property development and construction projects typically have a higher  and sometimes substantially higher  level of risk than the acquisition of existing properties 
we intend to actively pursue development and construction of multifamily apartment communities 
we cannot assure that we will complete development of the properties currently under development or any other development project that we may undertake 
risks associated with our development and construction activities may include the following development opportunities may be abandoned  construction costs of multifamily apartment communities may exceed original estimates  possibly making the communities uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at newly completed communities may not be sufficient to make the communities profitable  financing for the construction and development of projects may not be available on favorable terms or at all  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  and expenses of operating a completed community may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  development and construction activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
development and construction activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
investments in newly acquired properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
in the normal course of business  we typically evaluate potential acquisitions  enter into non binding letters of intent  and may  at any time  enter into contracts to acquire and may acquire additional properties 
however  we cannot assure that we will have the financial resources to make suitable acquisitions or those properties that satisfy our investment policies will be available for acquisition 
acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property might prove inaccurate 
other risks may include rehabilitation costs exceeding original estimates  possibly making a project uneconomical  financing not being available on favorable terms or at all  and rehabilitation and lease up not being completed on schedule 
in addition  there are general real estate investment risks associated with any new real estate investment  including environmental risks 
although we undertake an evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment before it is acquired  certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after the investment is acquired 
this could significantly increase our total acquisition costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
illiquidity of real estate and reinvestment risk may reduce economic returns to investors 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
additionally  the internal revenue code places certain limits on the number of properties a reit may sell without adverse tax consequences 
to affect our current operating strategy  we have in the past raised  and will seek to continue to raise additional funds  both through outside financing and through the orderly disposition of assets that no longer meet our investment criteria 
depending upon interest rates  current development and acquisition opportunities and other factors  generally we will reinvest the proceeds in additional multifamily properties  although such funds may be employed in other uses 
in the markets we have targeted for future acquisition of multifamily properties  there is considerable buying competition from other real estate companies  many of which may have greater resources  experience or expertise than we 
in many cases  this competition for acquisition properties has resulted in an increase in property prices and a decrease in property yields 
due to the relatively low capitalization rates currently prevailing in the pricing of potential acquisitions of multifamily properties which meet our investment criteria  we cannot assure that the proceeds realized from the disposition of assets  which no longer meet our investment criteria  can be reinvested to produce economic returns comparable to those being realized from the properties disposed of  or that we will be able to acquire properties meeting our investment criteria 
if we are unable to reinvest proceeds from the assets that no longer meet our investment criteria  or if properties acquired with such proceeds produce a lower rate of return than the properties disposed of  our results of operations may be materially affected 
in addition  a delay in reinvestment of such proceeds may have a material adverse effect on us 
we may seek to structure future dispositions as tax free exchanges  where appropriate  utilizing the non recognition provisions of section of the internal revenue code to defer income taxation on the disposition of the exchanged property 
for an exchange of these properties to qualify for tax free treatment under section of the internal revenue code  certain technical requirements must be met 
given the competition for properties meeting our investment criteria  it may be difficult for us to identify suitable properties within the applicable time frames in order to meet the requirements of section even if we can structure a suitable tax deferred exchange  as noted above  we cannot assure that we will reinvest the proceeds of any of these dispositions to produce economic returns comparable to those currently being realized from the properties which were disposed of 
substantial competition among multifamily properties and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities 
all of the properties currently owned by us are located in developed areas 
there are numerous other multifamily properties and real estate companies  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have  within the market area of each of our properties which compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities 
the number of competitive multifamily properties and real estate companies in these areas could have a material effect on our ability to rent the apartments and the rents charged  and development and acquisition opportunities 
the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
our operations are concentrated in the western united states  we are subject to general economic conditions in the regions in which we operate 
our portfolio is primarily located in the san francisco bay area  los angeles orange county  san diego  sacramento  seattle  the denver area and phoenix 
our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in  and other factors relating to  these geographic areas  including supply and demand for apartments in these areas  zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other properties and alternative forms of housing 
in that regard  certain of these areas have in the recent past experienced economic recessions and depressed conditions in the local real estate or rental markets 
to the extent general economic or social conditions in any of these areas further deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters  the value of the portfolio  our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 
our insurance coverage is limited and may not cover all losses to our properties 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  mold  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with certain policy specifications  limits and deductibles 
while as of december   we carried flood and earthquake insurance for our properties with an aggregate annual limit of  subject to substantial deductibles  we cannot assure that this coverage will be available on acceptable terms or at an acceptable cost  or at all  in the future  or if obtained  that the limits of those policies will cover the full cost of repair or replacement of covered properties 
in addition  there may be certain extraordinary losses such as those resulting from civil unrest or terrorist acts that are not generally insured or fully insured against or underinsured losses such as those resulting from claims in connection with the occurrence of mold  asbestos  and lead because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured or underinsured loss occur to a property  we could be required to use our own funds for restoration or lose all or part of our investment in  and anticipated revenues from  the property and would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness on the property 
any such loss could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
one property  red hawk ranch apartments  a unit operating community in fremont  california  requires extensive replacement work to correct damage we believe was caused by construction defects 
we estimate that the costs of remediation will approximate up to  we are currently pursuing litigation against the third party builder and various sub contractors 
if we are not able to recover these costs either through litigation  it would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
adverse changes in laws may affect our potential liability relating to our properties and our operations 
increases in real estate taxes and income  service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents  and may adversely affect our cash available for distribution and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions  as well as changes in laws affecting development  construction and safety requirements  may result in significant unanticipated expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
in addition  future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 
compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact our investment strategy 
a number of federal  state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial  and limits or restrictions on construction or completion of certain renovations may limit implementation of our investment strategy in certain instances or reduce overall returns on our investments  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
we review our properties periodically to determine the level of compliance and  if necessary  take appropriate action to bring such properties into compliance 
we believe  based on property reviews to date  that the costs of such compliance should not have a material adverse effect on us 
these conclusions are based upon currently available information and data  and we cannot assure that further review and analysis of our properties  or future legal interpretations or legislative changes  will not significantly increase the costs of compliance 
the operations of bre property investors llc are limited 
eleven of our properties are held by bre property investors llc  which is referred to in this annual report on form k as the operating company 
we are the sole managing member of the operating company and  as of december   held approximately a equity interest in it 
third parties as non managing members hold the remaining equity interests in the operating company 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing the operations of the operating company  the operating company is required to maintain certain debt service coverage  debt to asset and other financial ratios intended to protect the members rights to receive distributions 
in addition  with respect to the outstanding debt for two properties  the operating company is restricted from repaying its debt or taking certain other specified actions that could have adverse tax consequences for the members 
further  we  as the managing member  are restricted from taking certain other specified actions either absolutely or without the consent of a majority in interest of the non managing members or of the non managing members affected thereby including  but not limited to  any actions that would make it impossible to carry out the business of the operating company  that would subject a non managing member to liability as a managing member  or that would cause the operating company to institute bankruptcy proceedings or permit an automatic judgment to be entered against it by a creditor 
the requirement to maintain financial ratios and the restrictions on the actions of the operating company and us as managing member could have a material adverse affect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
further  under the terms of the operating company s limited liability company agreement  the operating company must obtain the consent of a majority in interest of the non managing members in order to dispose of two of the properties held by the operating company in a taxable sale or exchange prior to november   or dissolve the operating company other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the operating company s limited liability company agreement  such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or any merger  consolidation or other combination by us with or into another person  or reclassification  recapitalization or change of our outstanding equity interests 
these restrictions on our ability to dispose of a portion of our properties and to dissolve the operating company  even when such a disposition or dissolution of the operating company would be in our best interest  could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
the operating company also must distribute all available cash as defined in the operating company s limited liability company agreement on a quarterly basis as follows first  a priority distribution to members other than us until each member has received  cumulatively on a per operating company unit basis  distributions equal to the cumulative dividends declared with respect to one share of bre common stock over the corresponding period subject to adjustment from time to time as applicable to account for stock dividends  stock splits and similar transactions affecting bre common stock  and second  the balance to us 
if the operating company s available cash in any quarterly period is insufficient to permit distribution of the full amount of the priority distribution described above for that quarter  we are required to make a capital contribution to the operating company in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount necessary to permit the full priority distribution  or an amount equal to the sum of any capital expenditures made by the operating company plus the sum of any payments made by the operating company on account of any loans to or investments in  or any guarantees of the obligations of  bre or our affiliates for that quarterly period 
we may not voluntarily withdraw from the operating company or transfer all or any portion of our interest in the operating company without the consent of all of the non managing members  except in certain limited circumstances  such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or any merger  consolidation or other combination by us with or into another person  or any reclassification  recapitalization or change of our outstanding equity interests 
such restrictions on our withdrawal as the managing member of the operating company  and on our ability to transfer our interest in the operating company  could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
survey exceptions to certain title insurance policies may result in incomplete coverage in the event of a claim 
we have not obtained updated surveys for all of the properties we have acquired or developed 
because updated surveys were not always obtained  the title insurance policies obtained by us may contain exceptions for matters that an updated survey might have disclosed 
such matters might include such things as boundary encroachments  unrecorded easements or similar matters  which would have been reflected on a survey 
moreover  because no updated surveys were prepared for some properties  we cannot assure that the title insurance policies in fact cover the entirety of the real property  buildings  fixtures  and improvements which we believe they cover  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
risks due to real estate financing we anticipate that future developments and acquisitions will be financed  in whole or in part  under various construction loans  lines of credit  and other forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of additional debt or equity by us 
we expect periodically to review our financing options regarding the appropriate mix of debt and equity financing 
equity  rather than debt  financing of future developments or acquisitions could have a dilutive effect on the interests of our existing shareholders 
similarly  there are certain risks involved with financing future developments and acquisitions with debt  including those described below 
in addition  if new developments are financed through construction loans  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for such properties may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms or that the cash flow from new properties will be insufficient to cover debt service 
if a newly developed or acquired property is unsuccessful  our losses may exceed our investment in the property 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
we may be unable to renew  repay or refinance our outstanding debt 
we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  the risk that indebtedness on our properties  or unsecured indebtedness  will not be able to be renewed  repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness 
if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to us 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
furthermore  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies  all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value 
foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the internal revenue code 
rising interest rates would increase the cost of our variable rate debt 
we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness and interest rate hedges that bear interest at variable rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our common shares to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us  which could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily communities partially through borrowings including our lines of credit as well as from other sources such as sales of properties which no longer meet our investment criteria or the contribution of property to joint ventures which may in turn secure debt 
our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 
the restrictive terms of certain of our indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately billion 
our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth  interest coverage ratios  maximum secured debt  and total debt to capital  among others 
in the event that an event of default occurs  our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
failure to hedge effectively against interest rates may adversely affect results of operations 
we seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements  such as interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements 
these agreements involve risks  such as the risk that the counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements  that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes and that a court could rule that such an agreement is not legally enforceable 
hedging may reduce overall returns on our investments 
failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
potential liability under environmental laws under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in  on  around or under such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using the property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at a disposal or treatment facility  whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person 
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances 
federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks 
in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect  operation  management  development and or control of real properties  we may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines  and claims for injuries to persons and property 
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire and to proceed accordingly 
we cannot assure  however  that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future properties will reveal all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us  that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such properties  or that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability 
thus  we may have liability with respect to properties previously sold by our predecessors or us 
recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately 
we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold 
to the extent not covered by our pollution policy  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage  health concerns  or allegations thereof  arise 
risks associated with our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
while management continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we can not assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
deficiencies  particularly material weaknesses  in internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  a decline in our stock price  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  reputation  results of operation  financial condition or liquidity 
ranking of securities and subordination of claims a portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries  including the operating company 
our cash flow and the consequent ability to make distributions and other payments on our equity securities and to service our debt will be partially dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us  or upon loans or other payments of funds made by our subsidiaries to us 
in addition  debt or other arrangements of our subsidiaries may impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other distributions or loans to us 
likewise  a portion of our consolidated assets is owned by our subsidiaries  effectively subordinating certain of our unsecured indebtedness to all existing and future liabilities  including indebtedness  trade payables  lease obligations and guarantees of our subsidiaries 
the operating company has guaranteed amounts due under our unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
likewise  any other of our subsidiaries with assets or net income which  when multiplied by our effective percentage ownership interest in such subsidiary exceeds  or of our consolidated net income  respectively  is required to guarantee the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 
the operating company and other of our subsidiaries may also  from time to time  guarantee other of our indebtedness 
therefore  our rights and rights of our creditors  including the holders of other unsecured indebtedness  to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary s creditors  except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary  in which case our claims would still be effectively subordinate to any security interests in or mortgages or other liens on the assets of such subsidiary and would be subordinate to any indebtedness of such subsidiary senior to that held by us 
provisions in our charter and bylaws that could limit a change in control or deter a takeover in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities 
in order to protect us against risk of losing our status as a reit due to a concentration of ownership among our shareholders  our charter provides that any shareholder must  upon demand  disclose to our board of directors in writing such information with respect to such shareholder s direct and indirect ownership of the shares of our stock as we deem necessary to permit us to comply or to verify compliance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code  or the requirements of any other taxing authority 
our charter further provides  among other things  that if our board of directors determines  in good faith  that direct or indirect ownership of bre stock has or may become concentrated to an extent that would prevent us from qualifying as a reit  our board of directors may prevent the transfer of bre stock or call for redemption by lot or other means affecting one or more shareholders selected in the sole discretion of our board of directors of a number of shares of bre stock sufficient in the opinion of our board of directors to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership of bre stock into conformity with the requirements for maintaining reit status 
these limitations may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without consent of our board of directors 
in addition  certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may thereby inhibit a change in control 
our charter includes provisions granting our board of directors the authority to issue preferred stock from time to time and to establish the terms  preferences and rights of such preferred stock without the approval of our shareholders  restrictions on our shareholders ability to remove directors and fill vacancies on our board of directors  restrictions on unsolicited business combinations and restrictions on our shareholders ability to amend our charter 
our bylaws contain restrictions on our shareholders ability to call special meetings of our board of directors and to take action without a meeting  provisions granting our board of directors the power to amend our bylaws  provisions allowing our board of directors to increase its size  and restrictions on the transfer of shares of our capital stock with respect to the preservation of our reit status 
such provisions may deter tender offers for bre stock  which offers may be attractive to our shareholders  or deter purchases of large blocks of bre stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of bre stock over then prevailing market prices 
tax risks risks related to our reit status 
we believe we have operated and intend to continue operating in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code 
however  we cannot assure you that we have in fact operated  or will be able to continue to operate  in a manner so as to qualify  or remain qualified  as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy a number of requirements  including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources  such as rents from real property 
also  we must make distributions to shareholders aggregating annually at least of our net taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially adversely affect our investors  our ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we may be subject to some federal  state and local taxes on our income or property and  in certain cases  a penalty tax  in the event we sell property as a dealer 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at corporate rates  which would likely have a material adverse effect on us  our share price and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
in addition  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
this treatment would reduce funds available for investment or distribution to our shareholders because of the additional tax liability to us for the year or years involved 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make distributions to our shareholders 
to the extent that distributions to our shareholders would have been made in anticipation of qualifying as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate certain investments to pay the applicable tax 
finally  we cannot assure you that new legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification

multifamily properties percentage of total portfolio at cost  as of december percentage of total revenues  for the year ended december no single multifamily property accounted for more than of revenues in any of the five years ended december  this table summarizes regarding about our operating multifamily properties market number of communities units percentage of revenue percentage of noi occupancy market rent los angeles orange county san diego san francisco bay area seattle sacramento phoenix denver total weighted average the following table discloses certain operating data about our consolidated multifamily units december  total number of units portfolio occupancy average monthly rent per unit total number of properties represents the aggregate revenue and net operating income noi from properties in each market divided by the total revenue and net operating income of multifamily properties for the year ended december   and includes the results of properties acquired and developed during from the date of acquisition and completion 
excludes noi from properties sold during accordingly  these results do not reflect a full year of operations for properties acquired or completed in represents average physical occupancy for all stabilized properties for the twelve months ended december  the total is a weighted average by units for all communities shown 
represents average prevailing market rent per unit for the twelve months ended december  the total is a weighted average by units for all communities shown 
portfolio occupancy is calculated by dividing the total occupied units by the total units in the portfolio at the end of the year 
apartment units are generally leased to residents for rental terms not exceeding one year 
the following table summarizes our same store operating results 
same store properties are defined as properties that have been completed  stabilized and owned by us for at least two years 
december  number of same store units same store units of total units same store revenue increase decrease same store expense increase decrease same store noi decrease increase our business focus is the ownership and operation of multifamily communities  we evaluate performance and allocate resources primarily based on the net operating income noi of an individual multifamily community 
we define noi as the excess of all revenue generated by the community primarily rental revenue less direct real estate expenses 
accordingly  noi does not take into account community specific costs such as depreciation  capitalized expenditures and interest expense 
noi  including noi from discontinued operations  totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december    and respectively 
a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to noi for the three years ended december is as follows years ended december amounts in thousands net income available to common shareholders interest  including discontinued operations provision for depreciation  including discontinued operations minority interests in income from consolidated subsidiaries gain loss on sales of investments and rental properties general and administrative dividends attributable to preferred stock redemption related preferred stock issuance costs other expenses net operating income we consider community level and portfolio wide noi to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core property operations prior to the allocation of any corporate level property management overhead or general and administrative costs 
this is more reflective of the operating performance of the real estate  and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures  with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets 
however  because noi excludes depreciation and does not capture the change in the value of our communities resulting from operational use and market conditions  nor the level of capital expenditures required to adequately maintain the communities all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of noi as a measure of our performance is limited 
other equity reits may not calculate noi consistently with our definition and  accordingly  our noi may not be comparable to such other reits noi 
accordingly  noi should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of our performance 
noi should not be used as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
noi also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
development properties the following table provides data on our nine multifamily properties that are currently under various stages of development and construction 
completion of the development properties is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including construction delays and cost overruns 
we cannot assure that these properties will be completed  or that they will be completed by the estimated dates  or for the estimated amounts  or will contain the number of proposed units shown in the table below

included in this amount is million of costs for the completed units on the heights and completed units on galleria at towngate which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as direct investments in real estate investments in rental properties 
completion is defined as our estimate of when an entire project will have a final certificate of occupancy issued and be ready for occupancy 
completion dates have been updated to reflect our current estimates of receipt of final certificates of occupancy  which are dependent on several factors  including construction delays and the inability to obtain necessary public approvals 
land under development represents projects in various stages of pre development  development  and initial construction  for which construction or supply contracts have not yet been finalized 
as these contracts are finalized  projects are transferred to construction in progress on our consolidated balance sheet 
insurance  property taxes and income tax basis we carry comprehensive liability  fire  pollution  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on our properties with certain policy specifications  limits and deductibles 
in addition  at december   we carried flood and earthquake coverage with an annual aggregate limit of  after policy deductibles ranging from of damages 
management believes the properties are adequately covered by such insurance 
property taxes on portfolio properties are assessed on asset values based on the valuation method and tax rate used by the respective jurisdictions 
the gross carrying value of our direct investments in operating rental properties was  as of december  on the same date our assets had an underlying federal income tax basis of approximately  reflecting  among other factors  the carryover of basis on tax deferred exchanges 
headquarters we lease our corporate headquarters at market street  th floor  san francisco  california   from knickerbocker properties  inc  a delaware corporation 
the lease covers  rentable square feet at annual per square foot rents  which were as of december  the lease term ends on january  we also maintain regional offices in seattle  washington  irvine and san diego  california  phoenix  arizona  and denver  colorado 
item legal proceedings on april   we purchased red hawk ranch apartments  a unit operating community in fremont  california  from an unrelated third party builder 
the community now requires extensive replacement work to correct damage we believe was caused by construction defects 
on march   we filed suit in the alameda county superior court against the builder and other parties to protect against statutes of limitation 
we have conducted testing to determine the extent of the damage 
based upon the testing that has been performed  we have discovered that the exterior shell of each building at the community has been compromised 
as a result  during second quarter the size and scope of the lawsuit was expanded 
litigation and consulting charges recognized during and totaled  and  respectively  and are reported as other expenses on the consolidated statement of income 
the charges reported include litigation costs and consulting fees incurred to date during destructive testing to determine the extent of the damage and required reconstruction 
we commenced reconstruction during the second quarter of and expect to have the community restored during the next to months 
on january  we reached a settlement in connection with the red hawk ranch apartment community 
under terms of the settlement  we will receive an aggregate of  from various defendants and the assignment of certain agreements and claims associated with three subcontractors against whom the company intends to continue litigation 
all settlement funds have been deposited to an escrow account 
the settlement is contingent on a determination by the court that it constitutes a good faith settlement under california law 
the hearing is scheduled for march  and is subject to a thirty day appeal process 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies a gain contingency should be recognized in the period it is received and realized 
if the contingency is removed  the amount realized will be recorded as other income during that period 
we expect that costs of remediation will approximate up to  and future plaintiff litigation costs may exceed  under the provisions of fas  we have performed an impairment analysis on red hawk ranch apartments using undiscounted cash flows  which reflect the anticipated decreased net operating income during reconstruction 
no impairment charge was deemed necessary based on this analysis 
the net book value of the components of the buildings that are damaged and being replaced approximate  and are being depreciated over the reconstruction period 
additional depreciation recognized during and totaled approximately  and  respectively 
during reconstruction  costs that extend the useful life of the asset  increase its value or enhance safety of the community will be capitalized 
all other costs  including legal and consulting  will be expensed as incurred

part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol bre 
as of february   there were approximately  recordholders of bre s common stock and the last reported sales price on the nyse was 
the number of holders does not include shares held of record by a broker or clearing agency  but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one recordholder 
as of february   there were approximately  beneficial holders of bre s common stock 
this table shows the high and low sales prices of our common stock reported on the nyse composite tape and the dividends we paid for each common share years ended december  stock price dividends paid stock price dividends paid high low high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter since  when bre was founded  we have made regular and uninterrupted quarterly distributions to shareholders 
the payment of distributions by bre is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on numerous factors  including our cash flow  financial condition and capital requirements  reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors 
during the three months as well as the year ended december   there were no limited partnership units in bre property investors llc exchanged for shares of bre common stock 
equity plan compensation information equity compensation plan information is incorporated by reference from our proxy statement  relating to our annual meeting of shareholders  under the heading equity compensation plan information  to be filed with the securities and exchange commission within days of december  item selected financial data the selected financial data below should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
the results are affected by numerous acquisitions and dispositions as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
therefore  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report are not directly comparable to prior years 
amounts in thousands  except per share data operating results rental and ancillary revenues revenues from discontinued operations partnership and other income total revenues net income available to common shareholders plus net gain loss on sales of investments and rental properties depreciation from continuing operations depreciation from discontinued operations depreciation related to unconsolidated entities minority interest convertible into common shares funds from operations ffo other expenses net cash flows generated by operating activities net cash flows used in investing activities net cash flows generated by financing activities dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders and distributions to minority members weighted average shares outstanding basic dilutive effect of stock options weighted average shares outstanding diluted eps plus operating company units weighted average shares outstanding diluted ffo shares outstanding at end of period operating company units outstanding at end of period net income per share basic net income per share assuming dilution dividends paid to common shareholders balance sheet information and other data real estate portfolio  net of depreciation total assets total debt minority interest shareholders equity ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental performance measure of an equity reit 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income or loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation 
because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure because it excludes historical cost depreciation  as well as gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated property  from gaap net income 
by excluding depreciation and gains or losses on sales of real estate  management uses ffo to measure returns on its investments in real estate assets 
however  because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
management also believes that ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  is useful to investors in providing more meaningful comparisons of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to other companies 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of a reit s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our ffo may not be comparable to the ffo of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the nareit definition or apply interpret the definition differently 
for  ffo included a gain on sale of a minority interest in partnership totaling m 
other expenses for represent red hawk ranch litigation and consulting costs 
other expenses for represent a ceo retirement charge of m and red hawk ranch litigation and consulting costs totaling m 
other expenses for represent settlement charges and fees related to the pinnacle at macarthur joint venture dispute and class action application fee suit 
other expenses for represent losses from velocity hsi  inc  our former internet business that was spun off on august  under sfas  earnings per share  common share equivalents deemed to be anti dilutive are excluded from the diluted per share calculations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a self administered equity real estate investment trust or reit focused on the development  acquisition and management of multifamily apartment communities in seven metropolitan markets of the western united states 
at december   our portfolio had real estate assets with a net book value of approximately billion that included wholly or majority owned completed apartment communities  aggregating  units  two multifamily communities owned in joint ventures  comprised of apartment units  and nine apartment communities in various stages of construction and development  totaling  units 
we earn revenue and generate cash primarily by collecting monthly rent from our apartment residents 
our operating results reflect improved operating fundamentals  as a result of increased job growth in all of our operating markets 
during the year  market rents increased on average supporting annual revenue growth of more than in our same store portfolio 
additionally  portfolio wide physical occupancy averaged more than  turnover was  and operating expense growth was approximately 
we continued a capital recycling program initiated in  which is focused on concentrating our portfolio in california and seattle  washington 
during we completed the exit from salt lake city and announced our intention to reduce investment levels in denver and phoenix 
the result of the recycling program which is near completion is that of our fourth quarter net operating income comes from the coastal supply constrained markets of california and seattle  washington 
we have continued to experience sustained growth in our southern california markets  which comprised of our real estate net operating income in market rents in southern california have increased over the past three years while occupancy and turnover have remained stable 
management has focused its investment activities in the southern california markets due to these market dynamics  and has acquired  units  completed the development of units and commenced construction on another  units in this region during the last two years 
during market rents in the san francisco bay area market stabilized and by the end of had increased to  per unit  up from  in the increase in market rents was preceded by four years of declining rents  the result of weak economic conditions and job losses 
market rents in our bay area portfolio peaked in the third quarter of at approximately  per unit and declined sequentially to an average of  per unit by the end of while the market level rents have stabilized and improved in  management does not expect market rents to fully recover in this region until there is discernable job growth 
we continue to closely monitor and act upon the key operating metrics market rent  occupancy and turnover in each of our markets 
our wholly or majority owned apartment communities can be categorized as follows to better understand our overall results  units in communities were completed and stabilized for all of and same store communities   units in nine communities were acquired in or and as a result did not have comparable year over year operating results  units in three development communities were completed and stabilized during and and as a result did not have comparable year over year operating results   units in seven communities are classified as held for sale at december   and units in one community require significant reconstruction 
in addition to year over year economic operating performance  our results of operations for the three years ended december  were affected by income derived from acquisitions and completions of apartment communities  offset by the cost of capital associated with financing these transactions 
our book capitalization grew to billion at december   from billion at december   reflecting capital raised through offerings of debt  perpetual preferred stock and common stock 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenues total revenues were  in   in  and  in  including revenues from discontinued operations

the increase in is primarily due to increases in compensation  costs associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  other professional fees and insurance costs 
in addition  in we began expensing the cost associated with stock options in accordance with fas stock based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

on december   the board of directors determined the leadership transition between the ceo  mr 
frank mcdowell  and ms 
constance moore was complete 
as a result  future service by mr 
mcdowell as an executive consultant  as specified in his executive transition employment agreement  was no longer viewed as necessary 
the board and mr 
mcdowell mutually agreed to exercise the early termination without cause provision of this agreement  such that mr 
mcdowell retired from bre and the board effective january  the early termination resulted in a one time charge of approximately  during fourth quarter  rather than recognizing a monthly expense over the next two years of service by mr 
mcdowell 
the charge is comprised of approximately  in cash payments and  in non cash charges related to the fair value of stock options and restricted shares that vested under the agreement 
during  we executed a settlement agreement in connection with litigation with an unrelated third party regarding the pinnacle at macarthur place joint venture agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid the third party  and retained full ownership of the asset 
pinnacle at macarthur place is a recently developed and stabilized  unit community in santa ana  california 
also during  we reached a settlement agreement regarding a class action lawsuit brought against us with respect to application fees charged to residents from august to august under the terms of the settlement  we agreed to establish a  fund to reimburse prior applicants up to per applicant  and to pay certain related administration charges and legal expenses

discontinued operations sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses  depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale  and property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property 
in addition  the net gain or loss on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale is reported as discontinued operations 
during  we sold the three operating communities  which we held for sale at december   with a total of units 
the communities were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of approximately  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately  at december   seven operating communities were classified as held for sale under the provisions of sfas no depreciation has been recorded on these communities since september during  we sold three operating communities with a total of units 
the communities were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of approximately  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately during  we sold three operating communities with a total of  units 
the communities were sold for an aggregate gross sales price of approximately  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately the net gain on sale and the combined results of operations for these sixteen communities for each year presented are included in discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income 
these amounts totaled   and  for the years  and  respectively 
dividends attributable to preferred stock dividends attributable to preferred stock represent the dividends on our series a  series b  series c and series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock

all of our currently outstanding series of preferred stock have a per share liquidation preference 
net income available to common shareholders as a result of the various factors mentioned above  net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  as compared with  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  and  or per diluted share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources depending upon the availability and cost of external capital  we anticipate making additional investments in multifamily apartment communities 
these investments are expected to be funded through a variety of sources 
these sources may include internally generated cash  temporary borrowings under our revolving unsecured line of credit  proceeds from asset sales  public and private offerings of debt and equity securities  and in some cases the assumption of secured borrowings 
to the extent that these additional investments are initially financed with temporary borrowings under our revolving unsecured line of credit  we anticipate that permanent financing will be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities  proceeds from asset sales and secured debt 
we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations  meet debt service and dividend requirements  and finance future investments 
as of december   we had seven properties held for sale 
we do not expect the sale of these properties to have a material effect on future liquidity and capital resources 
on may   we closed an offering of  of five year senior unsecured notes 
the notes will mature on may  with a coupon rate of 
net proceeds from the offering  after all discounts  commissions and issuance costs  totaled approximately  on march   we closed an offering of  shares of series c cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering after all discounts  commissions and issuance costs totaled approximately  and were used for general corporate purposes

proceeds from these offerings have been used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of debt  redemption of equity securities  funding for development activities and financing for acquisitions 
pending these uses  we initially used the proceeds from these offerings to reduce borrowings under our revolving unsecured credit facility 
borrowings under our revolving unsecured line of credit totaled  at december   compared to  at december  drawings on the revolving unsecured line of credit are available to fund our investment activities and general corporate purposes 
we typically reduce our outstanding balance on the revolving unsecured line of credit with available cash balances 
subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter  we replaced our existing credit facility with a  unsecured revolving line of credit with a group of lenders 
the new credit facility has a four year term with a one year extension  which is available at our sole option 
based on our current debt ratings  the line of credit is priced at libor plus basis points 
initial borrowings under the new credit facility in the amount  were used to repay the previous credit facility and for other general corporate purposes 
upon repayment we terminated our previous credit facility 
the new credit facility will be used to fund acquisition and development activities as well as for general working capital purposes 
during the second quarter of  we decreased the borrowings on our secured credit facility with fannie mae from  to  in august  we amended the credit facility to reduce the number of multifamily communities securing the line from nine to four and modified certain geographical diversification requirements 
these four multifamily communities are held by a consolidated subsidiary of the company 
current borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates with maturities from one to nine months  plus a facility fee of 
our borrowing cost  including interest  margin and fees  averaged for subject to the terms of the facility  we have the option to increase its size to  borrowings under the secured facility are limited by the value of the properties we have pledged as security 
drawings under the facility are available to fund our investment activities and for general corporate purposes

our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth  interest coverage ratios  maximum secured debt and total debt to capital  among others 
we were in compliance with all such financial covenants throughout the year ended december  we anticipate that we will continue to require outside sources of financing to meet our long term liquidity needs beyond  including scheduled debt repayments  construction funding and property acquisitions 
at december   we had an estimated cost of  to complete existing construction in progress  with funding estimated from through scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years amounts in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total we manage joint venture investments that are recorded under the equity method of accounting with total assets of approximately  as of december  these joint ventures carry debt totaling approximately  none of which is guaranteed by us at december  during the first quarter of  we filed a new shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which we may issue up to  of securities  including debt securities  common stock and preferred stock 
our recent  note offering and our series d  preferred stock offering totaling  reduced the amount available for future issuances under this registration statement to  depending upon market conditions  we may issue securities under this or under future registration statements 
proceeds from issuances under our existing shelf registration statement may be used for general corporate purposes  including investing in additional multifamily communities  funding development activities  capital expenditures  redemption of securities  increasing our working capital and repaying indebtedness 
pending the application of the net proceeds  we may invest the proceeds in investment grade  interest bearing securities or temporarily reduce borrowings under our revolving unsecured line of credit 
we continue to consider other sources of possible funding  including further joint ventures and additional secured construction debt 
we own unencumbered real estate assets that could be sold  contributed to joint ventures or used as collateral for financing purposes subject to certain lender restrictions and have encumbered assets with significant equity that could be further encumbered should other sources of capital not be available 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
additional discussion of accounting policies that we consider significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
investments in rental properties rental properties are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment  if any  for impairment 
a land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on market research if acquired in a merger or in an operating community acquisition 
we have a development group which manages the design  development and construction of our apartment communities 
projects under development are carried at cost  including direct and indirect costs incurred to ready the assets for their intended use and which are specifically identifiable  including capitalized interest and property taxes until units are placed in service 
direct investment development projects are considered placed in service as certificates of occupancy are issued and the units become ready for occupancy 
depreciation begins as units are placed in service 
land acquired for development is capitalized and reported as land under development until the development plan for the land is formalized 
once the development plan is determined and construction contracts are signed  the costs are transferred to the balance sheet line item construction in progress 
interest is capitalized on the construction in progress at a rate equal to our weighted average cost of debt 
the capitalization of interest ends when the assets are readied for their intended use 
costs of replacements  such as appliances  carpets and drapes  are expensed 
improvements and betterments that increase the value of the property or extend its useful life are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which generally range from to years for buildings and three to ten years for other property 
the determination as to whether expenditures should be capitalized or expensed  and the period over which depreciation is recognized  requires management s judgment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our investments in real estate are periodically evaluated for indicators of impairment 
the evaluation of impairment and the determination of estimated fair value is based on several factors  and future events could occur which would cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and a reduction in carrying value to estimated fair value is warranted 
there were no assets for which an adjustment for impairment in value was made in  or in the normal course of business  we will receive offers for sale of our properties  either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process

consolidation in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was revised in december interpretation no 
 and addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
under interpretation no 
 arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as vies 
an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
under interpretation no 
 a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entity s equity holders as a group either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity through voting or similar rights  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie pursuant to interpretation no 
 the enterprise that is deemed to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of expected residual returns of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
based on the provisions of fin  we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we i enter into option agreements for the purchase of land from an entity and pay a non refundable deposit or ii enter into an arrangement with a financial partner for the formation of joint ventures which engage in multifamily real estate projects  a vie may be created under condition ii in the previous paragraph 
for each vie created  we compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows 
if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  the assets  liabilities and operations of the vie will be consolidated with our financial statements 
we consolidate entities not deemed as vies which we have the ability to control 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bre and controlled subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
impact of inflation approximately of our total revenues for were derived from apartment properties 
due to the short term nature of most apartment unit leases typically one year or less  we may seek to adjust rents to mitigate the impact of inflation upon renewal of existing leases or commencement of new leases  although we cannot assure that we will be able to adjust rents in response to inflation 
in addition  market rates may also fluctuate due to short term leases and other permitted and non permitted lease terminations 
dividends paid to common and preferred shareholders and distributions to minority members a cash dividend has been paid to common shareholders each quarter since our inception in the payment of distributions by bre is at the discretion of the board of directors and depends on numerous factors  including our cash flow  financial condition and capital requirements  reit provisions of the internal revenue code and other factors 
cash dividends per common share were in and in and total cash dividends paid to common shareholders for the three years ended december   and were   and  respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
we do not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our lines of credit 
we primarily enter into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and development  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we continuously evaluate our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
during we utilized four interest rate swap agreements to attain a floating rate of interest on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
the objective of the agreements was to lower our overall borrowing costs 
the swaps hedged the fair market value of a portion of our debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the hedges were perfectly effective and  therefore  changes in the derivative fair value and the change in fair value of the hedged items during the hedging period exactly offset with no valuation impact on our earnings 
the notional amount of the interest rate swaps and their termination dates matched the principal amounts and maturities of the hedged fixed rate debt balances 
as of december  there are no rate swap contracts outstanding 
the fair values of our financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash  other assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses  and lines of credit approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with an interest rate similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements 
the estimated fair value of our mortgage loans and unsecured senior notes is approximately  at december   as compared with a carrying value of  at that date 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have had an annualized unfavorable impact of approximately  and  on our earnings and cash flows based on these period end debt levels and our average variable interest rates for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt and  therefore  our exposure to market risk  nor can we assure that fixed rate  long term debt will be available to us at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
