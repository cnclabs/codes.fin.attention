item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as at and for the three years ended december  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the financial statements as at and for the three years ended december  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the results of operations and financial condition of the celgar mill with an annual production capacity of approximately  admts from the time of its acquisition in february in addition  our stendal mill with an initial annual production capacity of approximately  admts only commenced production in mid september results of operations we operate in the pulp and paper business and our operations are located primarily in germany and western canada 
our manufacturing facilities are comprised of a an nbsk pulp mill operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  rosenthal  near blankenstein  germany  which has an annual production capacity of approximately  admts  b a newly constructed  state of the art nbsk pulp mill  with an initial design production capacity of approximately  admts per year  near stendal  germany owned and operated by our owned subsidiary  stendal  c since the acquisition in february  the celgar nbsk pulp mill with an annual production capacity of approximately  admts located near castlegar  british columbia  canada  and d two paper mills located at heidenau and f hrbr cke  germany  which produce specialty papers and printing and writing papers and  based upon their current product mix  have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately  admts 
the stendal mill was completed substantially on its planned schedule and budget in the third quarter of and we are currently ramping up production 
total investment costs in respect of the stendal mill were approximately billion  the majority of which was financed under the stendal loan facility in the amount of million 
the stendal mill underwent extensive testing and evaluation in december and  in the first quarter of  we delivered an acceptance certificate and assumed responsibility for the operation of the mill 
see business stendal pulp mill 
effective september   the stendal mill was started up and we commenced expensing all of the costs  including interest  related to the stendal mill 
prior to that date  most of the costs  including interest  relating thereto were capitalized 
during the fourth quarter of  the stendal mill took days of planned downtime for maintenance and other improvements at which time it also installed two new digesters and certain additional measures were implemented as agreed to by the principal contractor and certain suppliers in connection with the acceptance test 
once fully operational  we believe the additional digesters should increase the annual production capacity of the stendal mill to in excess of  admts 
the stendal mill reached approximately of its initial rated capacity in the fourth quarter of when the ramp up of the stendal mill is completed in  we expect the mill to operate near its initial rated capacity 
see business stendal pulp mill 
in february  we acquired the celgar pulp mill for approximately million 
the celgar mill is a modern nbsk pulp mill that produces high quality nbsk pulp 
since its acquisition  we have been integrating the mill with our operations and are in the process of implementing approximately million in capital projects at the mill 
for more information about the acquisition of the celgar mill  see business the company acquisition of celgar pulp mill 
our results for the year ended december  include revenues of million and operating costs of million relating to the celgar mill 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we sold million principal amount of senior notes and approximately million of our shares by way of separate public offerings  the net proceeds of which  together with cash on hand  were utilized to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition  
table of contents including defined working capital  transaction costs  to refinance all of the bank indebtedness of our rosenthal mill and for working capital 
effective upon closing of the acquisition  we established a new revolving working capital facility for the rosenthal mill in the amount of million and for the celgar mill in the amount of million 
see business the financings for more information 
our financial performance depends on a number of variables that impact sales and production costs 
sales and production results are influenced largely by the market price for products and raw materials  the mix of products produced and foreign currency exchange rates 
kraft pulp and paper markets are highly cyclical  with prices determined by supply and demand 
demand for kraft pulp and paper is influenced to a significant degree by global levels of economic activity and supply is driven by industry capacity and utilization rates 
our product mix is important because premium grades of nbsk pulp and specialty papers generally achieve higher prices and profit margins 
our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs for pulp production  and waste paper and pulp for paper production 
wood chip and pulp log costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber and pulp  which are both highly cyclical 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
high operating rates and production efficiencies permit us to lower our average cost by spreading fixed costs over more units 
global economic conditions  changes in production capacity and inventory levels are the primary factors affecting kraft pulp and paper prices 
historically kraft pulp and paper prices have been cyclical in nature 
the average annual european list prices for nbsk pulp between and ranged from a low of per admt in to a high of per admt in following a decline in demand in  list prices for nbsk pulp also declined and averaged approximately per admt in an increase in demand resulting from improving american and major european economies and the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and other major currencies in resulted in european list prices for nbsk pulp increasing to approximately per admt in december despite relatively high inventory levels 
list prices for nbsk pulp in europe continued to strengthen overall in due to the relatively weak us dollar and improving world economies  and were approximately per admt in december list prices for nbsk pulp weakened in primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar and were approximately per admt in europe at the end of list prices for nbsk pulp were also generally lower in asia in list prices for nbsk pulp improved to approximately per admt in europe in february and producers are seeking a further per admt price increase in the first quarter of in february  list prices in asian markets also improved by approximately per admt compared to the fourth quarter levels 
however  there can be no assurance that higher list prices for nbsk pulp will be achieved or that they will not fall in the future 
a producer s sales realizations will reflect customer discounts  commissions and other items and nbsk pulp prices will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our financial performance for any reporting period is also impacted by changes in the us dollar to euro and canadian dollar exchange rates and in interest rates 
changes in currency rates affect our operating results because the price for our principal product  nbsk pulp  is generally based on a global industry benchmark that is quoted in us dollars  even though our sales are primarily invoiced in euros and canadian dollars 
therefore  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar will generally reduce the amount of revenues of our pulp operations 
most of our operating costs at our german mills  including our debt obligations under the stendal loan facility and or rosenthal working capital facility  are incurred in euros 
most of our operating costs at the celgar mill  including under its working capital facility  are in canadian dollars 
these costs do not fluctuate with the us dollar to euro or canadian dollar exchange rates 
thus  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and or the canadian dollar tends to reduce our sales revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
the effect of such weakening against the euro has been partially offset by gains from time to time on foreign currency derivatives we put into place to protect against such currency movements 
changes in interest rates can impact our operating results because the indebtedness we incurred under the credit facilities established for our pulp mills provide for floating rates of interest 

table of contents changes in currency exchange and interest rates also impact certain foreign currency and interest rate derivatives rosenthal used and stendal uses to partially protect against the effect of such changes 
gains or losses on such derivatives are included in our earnings  either as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
during  stendal entered into currency swaps in the aggregate principal amount of million to convert all of its long term indebtedness under the stendal loan facility from euros into us dollars  as well as certain currency forwards  some of which matured in  collectively referred to as the currency derivatives 
a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests was recorded in respect of the currency derivatives that were outstanding at the end of and a net realized loss of million before minority interests was recorded in respect of such currency derivatives that matured during  compared to a realized gain of approximately million upon the settlement of the currency derivatives relating to the rosenthal and stendal mills in see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information 
stendal  as required under its project financing  entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps  referred to as the stendal interest rate swaps  in august to fix the interest rate on approximately million of indebtedness for the full term of the stendal loan facility 
rosenthal had also entered into forward interest rate and interest cap contracts  referred to as the rosenthal interest rate contracts and  together with the stendal interest rate swaps  the interest rate contracts  in respect of a portion of its long term indebtedness under the rosenthal loan facility 
the rosenthal interest rate contracts were settled in february in connection with the repayment of the rosenthal loan facility 
see business the financings 
in the year ended december   we recorded a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests on the marked to market valuation of the stendal interest rate contracts and a realized loss of million upon the settlement of the rosenthal interest rate contracts  versus a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests on the rosenthal and stendal interest rate contracts in the year ended december  improving world economies resulted in an increase in interest rates in if world economies continue to strengthen  we would expect interest rates to continue to rise from their historically low levels 
higher interest rates could result in our recording marked to market non cash holding gains on the stendal interest rate contracts in future periods 
however  a fall in interest rates could result in our recording non cash holding losses on the stendal interest rate contracts in future periods when they are marked to market

in the year ended december   revenues from our pulp operations increased to million from million in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales at our stendal mill and sales from our celgar mill 
list prices for nbsk pulp in europe were approximately per admt in  compared to approximately per admt last year 
the decrease in nbsk pulp prices was partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro in pulp mill net sales realizations decreased to per admt on average in the year ended december  from per admt in  primarily as a result of lower price realizations of the stendal and celgar mills 

table of contents the stendal mill sold pulp at a discounted price as a result of its ramp up and the celgar mill sells a large portion of its production in asian markets which had lower prices than european markets 
cost of sales and general  administrative and other expenses for the pulp operations increased to million in the year ended december  from million in  primarily as a result of million of operating costs related to the stendal and celgar mills 
beginning in  our german operations became subject to the european union emissions trading scheme  pursuant to which our german mills have been granted emission allowances 
in the year ended december   we recorded a contribution to income from operations of million resulting from the sale of emission allowances by our german pulp mills 
on average  our fiber costs for pulp production at the rosenthal mill decreased marginally compared to last year 
depreciation for the pulp operations increased to million in the current period  from million in  primarily as a result of million of depreciation from the stendal and celgar mills  partially offset by lower depreciation at the rosenthal mill 
for the year ended december   the pulp operations generated operating income of million  versus an operating loss of million last year  primarily as a result of higher operating income at our german pulp mills including income from operations of million from our stendal mill  partially offset by an operating loss at our celgar mill 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar from february   the date of the acquisition of the celgar mill  by approximately versus the us dollar in negatively impacted the results of our celgar mill 
paper sales in the year ended december  were million  compared with million in the same period of last year as a result of higher sales volumes and a shift in the product mix at our paper mills 
cost of sales and general  administrative and other expenses for the paper operations in the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   our paper operations generated an operating loss of million  compared to an operating loss of million in  which included a non cash impairment charge of million related to the f hrbr cke paper mill

interest expense in the year ended december  increased to million from million a year ago  due to interest associated with our million senior note issue completed in february and higher borrowings relating to the stendal mill 
we capitalized most of the interest relating to the stendal mill prior to its start up in mid september in the year ended december   stendal entered into certain foreign currency derivatives to swap all of its long term bank indebtedness from euros to us dollars and certain currency forwards 
due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro in  we recorded a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests upon the marked to market valuation of the currency derivatives that were outstanding at the end of the period and a net realized loss of million before minority interests in respect of such derivatives that matured during the period

in the year ended december   minority interest  representing the two minority shareholders proportionate interest in the stendal mill  was million  compared to million in on may   our management determined to record  and our audit committee approved  an adjustment of million for the non cash impact of other than temporary impairment losses on our available for sale securities and a loan receivable that relate to an investment in a venture company  which was a legacy investment that we had held since approximately in april  the venture company proposed to place itself into liquidation 
as a result  management determined to record impairment charges sufficient to reduce its investment to the net amount estimated to be recovered 
we do not currently expect the impairment charge to result in any future cash expenditures 
we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per basic and diluted share  which reflected generally weak pulp markets  the realized and unrealized net losses on our currency and interest rate derivatives of million  interest expense relating to our stendal mill of million  the unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss on our long term debt of million and the non cash impairment charge of million relating to investments  partially offset by a non cash benefit for income taxes of million 
in  we reported net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  which included an income tax benefit of million relating to a reorganization of certain of our subsidiary companies 
we generated operating ebitda of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating ebitda is defined as income loss from operations plus depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges 
operating ebitda is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges of million and million to the income from operations of million and loss from operations of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management uses operating ebitda as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results  and as a benchmark relative to its competitors 
management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost  and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities 
in addition  we believe operating ebitda is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance 
operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income loss  including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments 
operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from operations as a measure of performance  nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
operating ebitda has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are that operating ebitda does not reflect i our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ii changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  iii the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our outstanding debt  iv minority interests on our stendal nbsk pulp mill operations  v the impact of realized or marked to market changes in our derivative positions  which can be substantial  and vi operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of impairment charges against our investments or assets 
because of these limitations  operating ebitda should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
see the statement of cash flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein 
because all companies do not calculate operating ebitda in the same manner  operating ebitda 
table of contents as calculated by us may differ from operating ebitda or ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by using operating ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and relying primarily on our gaap financial statements

list prices for nbsk pulp in europe were approximately per admt in  compared to approximately per admt last year 
the increase in nbsk pulp prices was partially offset by the weakness of the us dollar versus the euro in pulp mill net sales realizations increased to per admt on average in the year ended december  from per admt in  primarily as a result of higher prices  partially offset by lower price realizations of the stendal mill during its start up when it sold pulp at a discounted price 
we expect that such discount will be eliminated over time 
cost of sales and general  administrative and other expenses for the pulp operations increased to million in the year ended december  from million in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of million of operating costs related to the stendal mill 
on average  our fiber costs for pulp production at the rosenthal mill decreased by approximately compared to last year 

table of contents depreciation for the pulp operations increased to million in the current period  from million in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of million of depreciation from the stendal mill 
a change effective july  in our depreciation estimate in respect of our rosenthal mill resulted in a decrease of million in cost of sales 
for the year ended december   the pulp operations generated an operating loss of million  versus an operating loss of million in  primarily as a result of a loss from operations of million from our stendal mill 
such loss from our stendal mill resulted primarily from expensing certain costs associated with the mill prior to its start up and the higher production costs and lower price realizations it incurred during its start up 
paper sales in the year ended december  were million  compared with million in  primarily as a result of a shift in the product mix at the paper mills 
cost of sales and general  administrative and other expenses for the paper operations in the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december   primarily as a result of a non cash million impairment charge relating to our paper operations 
in november  our management determined to record and our audit committee approved a non cash impairment charge of million to write off the carrying value of our f hrbr cke paper mill assets 
based upon its current product mix  the mill has an annual production capacity of approximately  admts and produces primarily printing and writing paper 
we determined to take the impairment charge as the f hrbr cke mill has generated weaker than expected returns over a period of time despite changes to its product mix 
we do not expect the impairment charge in and of itself to result in future cash expenditures as we intend to continue to operate the f hrbr cke mill 
for the year ended december   our paper operations generated an operating loss of million  which included the non cash impairment charge of million  compared to operating income of million in in  we had a loss from operations of million  compared to a loss of million last year  primarily as a result of a loss from operations of million from our stendal mill and the million non cash impairment charge related to our f hrbr cke paper mill 
interest expense excluding capitalized interest of million relating to the stendal pulp mill in the year ended december  increased to million from million a year ago  due to higher borrowings resulting primarily from our million convertible note issue in october and the inclusion of interest expense of million relating to the stendal mill

restricted group results year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for the restricted group for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the comparative period of  primarily because of the inclusion of pulp sales from the celgar mill 
pulp sales realizations for the restricted group decreased to per admt on average in the year ended december  from per admt in  primarily as a result of lower sales prices realized by the celgar mill  which sells a large portion of its production in asian markets which had lower sales prices than european markets 
the decrease in nbsk pulp prices was partially offset by the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro in as part of enhancing our sales and marketing group and activities  in november mercer inc assumed responsibility for the pulp sales of the stendal mill for which it receives a fee from stendal of approximately of sales 
costs of sales and general  administrative and other expenses for the restricted group in the year ended december  increased to million from million in the comparative period of  primarily as a result of the inclusion of the results of the celgar mill  partially offset by lower production costs at the rosenthal mill 
depreciation for the restricted group was million in the current period  versus million in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of depreciation of the celgar mill  partially offset by lower depreciation at our rosenthal mill 
in the year ended december   the restricted group reported income from operations of million  compared to million last year  primarily as a result of higher operating income from our rosenthal mill  offset by an operating loss at our celgar mill 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar from february   the date of the acquisition of the celgar mill  by approximately versus the us dollar in negatively impacted the results of our celgar mill 
interest expense for the restricted group in the year ended december  increased to million from million a year ago  primarily due to higher borrowings resulting from our million senior note offering in february on may   our management determined to record  and our audit committee approved  a non cash impairment charge of million related to an investment in a venture company  which is the last of a legacy investment that we have held since approximately we do not currently expect to incur any future cash expenditures related thereto 
in the year ended december   the restricted group realized a loss of million on the settlement of the rosenthal interest rate derivatives  versus a marginal unrealized non cash holding loss on the marked to market valuation of the interest rate derivatives related to the rosenthal mill in in the year ended december   the restricted group recorded a realized gain of approximately million on the settlement of the currency derivatives related to the rosenthal mill 
the restricted group did not have any currency derivatives outstanding during that materially affected its results 
in addition  the restricted group recorded an unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss on debt of million in the net loss for the restricted group for the year ended december  was million  which reflected generally weak markets  higher interest expense of million  the unrealized non cash foreign exchange loss on debt of million and the non cash impairment charge of million on investments 
the overall strength of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar in negatively impacted the results of our celgar mill 
in  the restricted group reported net income of million  which included an income tax benefit of million relating to a reorganization of certain of our subsidiary companies and the gain on derivative instruments of million

during the fourth quarter of  we completed a reorganization of certain of our german subsidiary companies and tax field audits for years prior to of certain of our german subsidiaries were also completed 
as a result  we re evaluated our income tax provision and deferred income tax asset valuation allowance and recorded an income tax benefit related to the restricted group of million for the year ended december  net income for the restricted group for the year ended december  was million  which reflected improved nbsk pulp prices and the positive impact of the net gain on derivative instruments of the rosenthal mill and the income tax benefit

at december   the restricted group had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at the end of at december   the restricted group had working capital of million 
we expect the restricted group to meet its interest and debt service expenses and meet the working and maintenance capital requirements for its current operations for the next months from cash flow from operations  cash on hand and the working capital loan facilities for the rosenthal and celgar mills in the amounts of million and million  respectively  put into effect in february critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  asset impairments  derivative financial instruments  environmental conservation  allocation of purchase price of acquisitions  asset retirement obligations  pensions and post retirement benefit obligations  income taxes  and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
we have identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
derivative instruments 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  derivative instruments are measured at fair value and reported in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
accounting for gains or losses depends on the intended use of the derivative instruments 
gains or losses on derivative instruments which are not designated hedges are recognized in earnings in the period of the change in fair value 
accounting for gains or losses on derivative instruments designated as hedges depends on the type of hedge and these gains or losses are recognized in either earnings or other comprehensive income 
we reported a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests in respect of the stendal interest rate contracts and a net realized loss of million in respect of the settlement of the rosenthal interest rate contracts for the year ended december  we also reported a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million in respect of the currency derivatives that were outstanding at the end of and a net realized loss of million in respect of the currency derivatives settled in 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our management to make subjective judgments 
in addition  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity of the assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
our management considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets which are comprised primarily of tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  both of which will reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized  based on currently available information  including  but not limited to  the following the history of the tax loss carryforwards and their expiry dates  our projected earnings  and tax planning opportunities 
if we believe that it is more likely than not that some of these deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on currently available information  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets 
as at december   we had million in deferred tax assets and million in valuation allowances  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
if market conditions improve or tax planning opportunities arise in the future  we will reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax benefits 
if market conditions deteriorate in the future  we will increase our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax expenses 
any change in tax laws  particularly in germany  will change the valuation allowances in future periods 
environmental 
our operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations  dealing primarily with water  air and land pollution control 
in recent years  we have devoted significant financial and management resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are currently in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and our respective operating permits 
under german state environmental rules relating to effluent discharges  industrial users are required to pay wastewater fees based upon the amount of their effluent discharge 
these rules also provide that an industrial user which undertakes environmental capital expenditures and lowers certain effluent discharges to prescribed levels may offset the amount of these expenditures against the wastewater fees that they would otherwise be required to pay in a three year period 
the requirement and timing of capital expenditures and the amount of wastewater fee charges are subject to negotiation with german government agencies 
as a result  we believe that our capital investment programs for our german manufacturing plants will largely offset the wastewater fees that would have been payable for the past three years  subject to environmental audits 
other than wastewater fees  we accrue for environmental remediation liabilities on a site by site basis when it is probable that a loss can be reasonably estimated  or as a result of an environmental action or claim  environmental studies that we conduct or regulatory assessment 
as at december   we recorded a liability for environmental conservation expenditures of million  based on environmental studies that we conducted 
we believe that the liability amount recorded is sufficient  subject to future changes in environmental regulations 
pensions 
celgar has a defined benefit pension plan for its salaried employees which is funded  trusteed and non contributory 
the cost of the benefits earned by the salaried employees is determined using the projected benefit method pro rated on services 
the pension expense reflects the current service cost  the 
table of contents interest on the unfunded liability and the amortization over the estimated average remaining service life of the employees of i the unfunded liability and ii experience gains or losses 
with respect to the pensions of its hourly paid employees  who are covered by a multi employer pension plan  celgar charges its contributions to this plan against earnings 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r addresses the requirements of an entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost of such award will be recognized over the period during which an option holder is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas r on a modified prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal for a discussion of other new accounting standards see note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements in this annual report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended 
these statements are based on present information we have related to our existing business circumstances and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
we caution you that we do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or income during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and to a lesser extent the canadian dollar  which may affect our results of operations and financial condition and  consequently  our fair value 
we manage these risks through internal risk management policies and  with respect to risks related to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  with the use of derivatives 
we use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to interest rate and us dollar euro currency risks 
we may in the future use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to fluctuations in pulp prices 
we also use derivatives to reduce our potential losses or to augment our potential gains  depending on our management s perception of future economic events and developments 
these types of derivatives are generally highly speculative in nature 
they are also very volatile as they are highly leveraged given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts 
many of our strategies  including the use of derivatives  and the types of derivatives selected by us  are based on historical trading patterns and correlations and our management s expectations of future events 
however  these strategies may not be fully effective in all market environments or against all types of risks 
unexpected market developments may affect our risk management strategies during this time  and unanticipated developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur losses 

table of contents derivatives derivatives are contracts between two parties where payments between the parties are dependent upon movements in the price of an underlying asset  index or financial rate 
examples of derivatives include swaps  options and forward rate agreements 
the notional amount of the derivatives is the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate the payments to be exchanged between the two parties and the notional amount itself is not generally exchanged by the parties 
the principal derivatives we use are foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate derivatives 
foreign exchange derivatives include currency swaps which involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency 
such cross currency swaps involve the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies 
they also include foreign exchange forwards which are contractual obligations in which two counterparties agree to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a pre determined future date 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the over the counter market 
interest rate derivatives include interest rate forwards forward rate agreements which are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest rate sensitive financial instrument on a future date at a specified price 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between different counterparties in the over the counter market 
they also include interest rate swaps which are over the counter contracts in which two counterparties exchange interest payments based upon rates applied to a notional amount 
we use foreign exchange derivatives to convert some of our costs including currency swaps relating to our long term indebtedness from euros to us dollars 
we use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate of interest on indebtedness  including under the stendal loan facility and  prior to its repayment in february  the rosenthal loan facility 
all of the derivatives we entered into were pursuant to the rosenthal loan facility  which was repaid and discharged in february  and the stendal loan facility  each of which provided facilities for foreign exchange derivatives  interest rate derivatives and commodities derivatives  subject to prescribed controls  including maximum notional and at risk amounts 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of the rosenthal mill prior to the repayment of the rosenthal loan facility and stendal mill  respectively  and have the benefit of certain german governmental guarantees 
these credit facilities do not have any separate margin requirements when derivatives are entered into pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof and are subsequently marked to market 
the new revolving working capital credit facility we established in february for the rosenthal mill allows us to enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to its operations 
all of our outstanding derivatives are marked to market at the end of each reporting period  and all unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings for a reporting period 
we determine market valuations based primarily upon valuations provided by our counterparties 
in march  rosenthal entered into currency derivatives which included two currency swaps in the aggregate principal amount of million that mature in september and september  respectively 
as nbsk pulp prices are quoted in us dollars and the majority of our business transactions are denominated in euros  rosenthal had entered into the currency swaps to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro on notional amounts under the rosenthal loan facility 
under these currency swaps  rosenthal effectively paid the principal and interest in us dollars and at us dollar borrowing rates 
the rosenthal currency derivatives also included a currency forward in the notional amount of million maturing in march that was entered into to reduce or limit rosenthal s exposure to currency risks and to augment its potential gains or to reduce its potential losses 
in addition  rosenthal entered into the rosenthal interest rate contracts in to either fix or limit the interest rates in connection with certain of its indebtedness 

table of contents in august  stendal entered into the stendal interest rate swaps in connection with its long term indebtedness relating to the stendal mill to fix the interest rate under the stendal loan facility at the then low level  relative to its historical trend and projected variable interest rate 
these contracts were entered into under a specific credit line under the stendal loan facility and are subject to prescribed controls  including certain maximum amounts for notional and at risk amounts 
under the stendal interest rate swaps  stendal pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate with the interest payments being calculated on a notional amount 
the interest rates payable under the stendal loan facility were swapped into fixed rates based on the eur euribor rate for the repayment periods of the tranches under the stendal loan facility 
stendal effectively converted the stendal loan facility from a variable interest rate loan into a fixed interest rate loan  thereby reducing interest rate uncertainty 
in march  stendal also entered into currency derivatives which are comprised of a currency swap in the principal amount of million which matures in april and a currency forward contract for the notional amount of million maturing in march to reduce or limit its exposure to currency risks and to augment its potential gains or reduce its potential losses 
in december  we settled all of the currency derivatives then outstanding relating to the rosenthal and stendal mills due to the substantial weakening of the us dollar versus the euro in in february  we settled the rosenthal interest rate contracts in connection with the repayment of the rosenthal loan facility 
in the first quarter of  stendal entered into foreign currency derivatives in order to swap approximately three quarters of its long term indebtedness outstanding under the stendal mill s project loan facility into us dollars as follows i approximately million in principal amount was swapped into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october  and ii approximately million in principal amount was swapped into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october in the second quarter of  stendal swapped the balance of its long term indebtedness under the stendal mill s project loan facility  being approximately million in principal amount  into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october these currency swaps were entered into by stendal to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro on notional amounts under the stendal loan facility 
during the first quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward contract at a rate of with a maturity in february and a million currency forward at a rate of which matured in september during the second quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward contract at a rate of which also matured in september in the third quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward at a rate of which matured in october these currency derivatives were entered into by stendal to reduce or limit its exposure to currency risks and to augment its potential gains or reduce its potential losses 
we are exposed to very modest credit related risks in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivative contracts 
however  we do not expect that the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  will fail to meet their obligations
