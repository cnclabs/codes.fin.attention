item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on february  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased industrial and commercial real property and selectively making long term industrial and commercial mortgage loans 
most of the portfolio of real estate we currently own is leased to a wide cross section of tenants ranging from small businesses to large public companies 
many of which do not have publicly rated debt 
we have in the past entered into  and intend in the future to enter into  purchase agreements for real estate having triple net leases with terms of approximately to years  with built in rental increases built 
under a triple net lease  the tenant is required to pay all operating  maintenance and insurance costs and real estate taxes with respect to the leased property 
at december   we owned properties and had two mortgage loans 
we have also acquired properties subsequent to december  we are actively communicating with buyout funds  real estate brokers and other third parties to locate properties for potential acquisition or mortgage financing in an effort to build our portfolio 
we conduct substantially all of our activities  including ownership of all of our properties  through gladstone commercial limited partnership  a delaware limited partnership formed on may   which we refer to as our operating partnership 
we control our operating partnership through our ownership of gclp business trust ii  a massachusetts business trust  which is the general partner of our operating partnership  and through our ownership of gclp business trust i  a massachusetts business trust  which holds all of the limited partnership units of our operating partnership 
we expect that our operating partnership may issue limited partnership units from time to time in exchange for industrial and commercial real property 
by structuring our acquisitions in this manner  the sellers of the real estate will generally be able to defer the realization of gains until they redeem the limited partnership units 
limited partners who hold limited partnership units in our operating partnership will be entitled to redeem these units for cash or  at our election  shares of our common stock on a one for one basis at any time 
whenever we issue common stock for cash  we are obligated to contribute the net proceeds we receive from the sale of the stock to our operating partnership and our operating partnership is  in turn  obligated to issue an equivalent number of limited partnership units to us 
our operating partnership will distribute the income it generates from its operations to its partners  including gclp business trust i and gclp business trust ii  both of which are beneficially owned by us  on a pro rata basis 
we will  in turn  distribute the amounts we receive from our operating partnership to our stockholders in the form of monthly cash distributions 
we have historically operated  and intend to continue to operate  so as to qualify as a reit for federal tax purposes  thereby generally avoiding federal income taxes on the distributions we make to our stockholders 
gladstone management corporation  a registered investment adviser and an affiliate of ours  serves as our external adviser our adviser 
our adviser is responsible for managing our business on a day to day basis and for identifying and making acquisitions and dispositions that it believes meets our investment criteria

expenses prior to october   our adviser had an expense sharing arrangement with gladstone capital advisers  a wholly owned subsidiary of our affiliate  gladstone capital corporation  through which the entire workforce was employed 
under that relationship  our adviser reimbursed gladstone capital advisers for a portion of gladstone capital advisers total payroll and benefits expenses based on the percentage of total hours worked by gladstone capital advisers employees on our matters on an employee by employee basis and a portion of gladstone capital advisers total overhead expense based on the percentage of total hours worked by all gladstone capital advisers employees on our matters 
in turn  subject to the terms and conditions of our advisory agreement  our adviser passed these charges on to us 
effective october   the expense sharing arrangement with gladstone capital advisers was terminated  and all personnel are now directly employed by our adviser 
pursuant to the terms of our advisory agreement  we continue to be responsible for a portion of our adviser s total payroll and benefits expenses based on the percentage of time our adviser s employees devote to our matters on an employee by employee basis and a portion of our adviser s total overhead expense based on the percentage of time worked by all of our adviser s employees on our matters 
the termination of the arrangement between our adviser and gladstone capital advisers has not materially changed the level of our expenses 
during the years ended december  and  and the period from february  inception through december   payroll and benefits expenses  which are part of the management fee paid to our adviser  were approximately   and  respectively 
the actual amount of payroll and benefits expenses which we will be required to reimburse our adviser in the future is not determinable  but we currently estimate that during the year ending december  this amount will be approximately million 
this estimate is based on our current expectations regarding our adviser s payroll and benefits expenses and the proportion of our adviser s time we believe is likely to be spent on matters relating to our business 
to the extent that our adviser s payroll and benefits expenses are greater than we expect or our adviser allocates a greater percentage of its time to our business  our actual reimbursement to our adviser for our share of its payroll and benefits expenses could be materially greater than we currently estimate 
we compensate our adviser through reimbursement of our portion of our adviser s payroll  benefits and general overhead expenses 
this reimbursement is generally subject to a combined annual management fee limitation of of our average invested assets for the year  with certain exceptions 
reimbursement for overhead expenses is only required up to the point that reimbursed overhead expenses and payroll and benefits expenses  on a combined basis  equal of our average invested assets for the year  and general overhead expenses are required to be reimbursed only if the amount of payroll and benefits reimbursed to our adviser is less than of our average invested assets for the year 
however  payroll and benefits expenses are required to be reimbursed by us to the extent that they exceed the overall annual management fee limitation 
to the extent that overhead expenses payable or reimbursable by us exceed this limit and our independent directors determine that the excess expenses were justified based on unusual and nonrecurring factors which they deem sufficient  we may reimburse our adviser in future years for the full amount of the excess expenses  or any portion thereof  but only to the extent that the reimbursement would not cause our overhead expense reimbursements to exceed the limitation in any year 
to date  the advisory fee has not exceeded the annual cap 
during the years ended december  and  and the period from february  inception through december   we reimbursed our adviser was approximately   and  respectively  of overhead expenses 
the actual amount of overhead expenses for which we will be required to reimburse our adviser in the future is not determinable  but we currently estimate that  during the year ending december   this amount will be approximately  under the terms of the advisory agreement  we are responsible for all expenses incurred for our direct benefit 
examples of these expenses include  legal  accounting  interest  tax preparation  directors and officers insurance  stock transfer services  shareholder related fees  consulting and related fees 
during the years ended december  and  and the period from february  inception through december   the total amount of these expenses that we incurred was approximately   and   of which related to our initial public offering and was charged to additional paid in capital  and the remainder of which related to direct expenses was charged to operating expenses  respectively 
in addition  we are also responsible for all fees charged by third parties that are directly related to our business  which may include real estate brokerage fees  mortgage placement fees  lease up fees and transaction structuring fees although we may be able to pass some or all of such fees on to our tenants and borrowers 
the actual amount of such fees that we incur in the future will depend largely upon the aggregate costs of the properties we acquire  the aggregate amount of mortgage loans we make  and the extent to which we are able to shift the burden of such fees to our tenants and borrowers 
accordingly  the amount of these fees that we will pay in the future is not determinable at this time 
on february   our board of directors voted to proceed with a proxy solicitation to our stockholders in connection with which the stockholders would consider  among other things  a proposal to enter into a new advisory agreement with our adviser  which would provide for a performance based incentive structure  rather than the structure under the current advisory agreement which provides for a pass through of costs incurred by our adviser in connection with the management of our operations 
a preliminary proxy statement was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on february  describing the new advisory agreement  and we intend to present this proposal to approve the terms of the new agreement to our stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held on may  critical accounting policies management believes our most critical accounting policies are revenue recognition including straight line rent  investment accounting  purchase price allocation  accounting for our investments in real estate  provision for loans losses  the accounting for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  income taxes and stock based compensation 
each of these items involves estimates that require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
management relies on its experience  collects historical data and current market data  and analyzes these assumptions in order to arrive at what it believes to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition rental income includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease 
because certain of our leases contain rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset  and include in revenues  deferred rent receivable that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
deferred rent receivable in the accompanying balance sheets includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue as recorded on a straight line basis and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the lease terms  along with the capitalized above market lease values of certain acquired properties 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  to what extent the deferred rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review deferred rent receivable  as is it relates to straight line rents  on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectibility of deferred rent with respect to any given tenant is in doubt  we would record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the specific rent receivable  which would have an adverse effect on our net income for the year in which the reserve is increased or the direct write off is recorded and would decrease our total assets and stockholders equity 
investment accounting management considers its loans and other lending investments to be held for investment 
we reflect held for investment investments at amortized cost less allowance for loan losses  acquisition premiums or discounts  deferred loan fees and undisbursed loan funds 
on occasion  we may acquire loans at small premiums or discounts based on the credit characteristics of such loans 
these premiums or discounts are recognized as yield adjustments over the lives of the related loans 
loan origination or exit fees  as well as direct loan origination costs  are also deferred and recognized over the lives of the related loans as yield adjustments 
if loans with premiums  discounts  loan origination or exit fees are prepaid  we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase in the prepayment gain or loss 
interest income is recognized using the effective interest method applied on a loan by loan basis 
prepayment penalties or yield maintenance payments from borrowers  if any  are recognized as additional income when received 
purchase price allocation we account for acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the purchase price of real estate to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases  the value of unamortized lease origination costs and the value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from nine to eighteen months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired are allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which generally range from five to twenty years 
the value of customer relationship intangibles are amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
we record above market and below market in place lease values for owned properties based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize the capitalized above market lease values  included in the accompanying balance sheet as part of deferred rent receivable  as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we will amortize any capitalized below market lease values as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
risk rating in evaluating each transaction that it considers for investment  our adviser seeks to assess the risk associated with the potential tenant or borrower 
for companies that have debt that has been rated by a national credit ratings agency  our adviser uses the rating as determined by such ratings agency 
for companies that do not have publicly rated debt  our adviser calculates and assigns to our borrowers and tenants a risk rating under our ten point risk rating scale 
our risk rating system is designed to assess qualitative and quantitative risks associated with our prospective tenants and borrowers 
we have developed our risk rating system to approximate the risk rating systems of major credit ratings agencies 
while we seek to mirror the systems of these credit ratings agencies  we cannot assure you that our risk rating system provides the same risk rating for a particular tenant or borrower as a credit ratings agency would 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two credit ratings agencies to rate the risk of public debt securities of major companies 
because we have established our system to rate the risk associated with mortgage loans and real estate leases to private companies that are unrated by any credit ratings agency  we cannot assure you that the correlation between our system and the credit ratings set out below is accurate 
first second our ratings ratings system agency agency description a baa bbb probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is or less baa bbb probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to ba bb probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to ba bb probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to ba bb probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to b b probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to first second our ratings ratings system agency agency description a b b probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to b b probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to caa ccc probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to caa ccc probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to caa cc probability of default during the next ten years is and the expected loss is to n a d probability of default during the next ten years is  or there is a payment default  and the expected loss is greater than a the default rates set forth above assume a ten year lease or mortgage loan 
if the particular investment has a term other than ten years  the probability of default is adjusted to reflect the reduced risk associated with a shorter term or the increased risk associated with a longer term 
we generally anticipate entering into transactions with tenants or borrowers that have a risk rating of at least based on the above scale which would equate to tenants or borrowers whose debt rating would be at least b or b 
once we have entered into a transaction  we periodically re evaluate the risk rating  or debt rating as applicable  of the investment for purposes of determining whether we should increase our reserves for loan losses or allowance for uncollectible rent 
to date  there have been no allowances for uncollectible rent or reserves for loan losses 
our board of directors may alter our risk rating system from time to time 
the following table reflects the average risk rating of our tenants and borrowers rating average weighted average highest lowest investments in real estate we record investments in real estate at cost  and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
we expense costs of repairs and maintenance as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures  and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because  if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate  we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that the operations related to properties that have been sold or that we intend to sell be presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented  and properties we intend to sell be designated as held for sale on our balance sheet 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  we review the recoverability of the property s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
provision for loan losses our accounting policies require that we reflect in our financial statements an allowance for estimated credit losses with respect to mortgage loans we have made based upon our evaluation of known and inherent risks associated with our private lending assets 
we have extended two mortgage loans and have not experienced any actual losses in connection with our lending investments 
management reflects provisions for loan losses on a portfolio basis based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults  and the value of the collateral underlying our investments 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ materially from these estimates 
accounting for derivative financial investments and hedging activities we will account for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  using sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  will be considered cash flow hedges 
we will formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
we will periodically review the effectiveness of each hedging transaction  which involves estimating future cash flows 
cash flow hedges will be accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
amounts will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
as of december   we were not a party to any separate derivatives contract 
certain of our leases and loans contain embedded derivatives  principally libor floors  which do not require separate accounting 
income taxes our financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have operated  and we intend to continue to operate  in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and  as a result  we do not expect to pay substantial corporate level income taxes 
many of the requirements for reit qualification  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distributions to our stockholders 
stock based compensation we currently apply the intrinsic value method to account for the issuance of stock options under our equity incentive plan in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  where appropriate 
in this regard  the substantial portion of these options were granted to individuals who are our officers and who qualify as leased employees under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
accordingly  because the grants were at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the stock at date of grant  we did not record any expense related to the issuance of these options under the intrinsic value method 
we will adopt sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective january   which will require us to begin expensing any unvested and future stock options as compensation cost 
in october of  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fasb staff position no 
fas r fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r 
fsp fas r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
the fasb addresses the notion of mutual understanding  specifically that a mutual understanding shall be presumed to exist at the date the award is approved in accordance with the relevant corporate governance requirements if  the award is a unilateral grant and therefore the recipient does not have the ability to negotiate the terms and conditions of the award with the employer and  the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period for the date of approval 
we will apply fsp fas r in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  results of operations our weighted average yield on the portfolio as of december  was approximately 
the weighted average yield was calculated by taking the annualized straight line rent or mortgage interest payments of each acquisition as a percentage of the acquisition price 
a comparison of our operating results for the years ended december  and is below december  december  change change operating revenues rental income interest income from mortgage note receivable tenant recovery revenue total operating revenues operating expenses depreciation and amortization management advisory fee professional fees taxes and licenses insurance general and administrative total operating expenses other income expense interest income from temporary investments interest income employee loans interest expense income before realized and unrealized losses realized and unrealized loss from foreign currency net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december   we earned  of rental income as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  in rental income is primarily due to the acquisition of properties between december  and december   and properties acquired during that were held for the full year of interest income from the mortgage loans increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  is partially due to a mortgage loan that was originated during the first quarter of  and interest was only earned on this loan for a portion of the year ended december  the remaining increase was a result of an additional mortgage loan issued in april of for the year ended december   we earned  of tenant recovery revenue 
this tenant recovery revenue resulted from approximately  of franchise taxes we paid that were recovered for the tax year from the tenants of our mt 
pocono  pennsylvania and charlotte  north carolina properties  and approximately  that will be recovered for the tax year from the tenants of our canton  north carolina  charlotte  north carolina and mt  pocono  pennsylvania properties 
it also includes approximately  of the management fee reimbursed by the tenant in our charlotte  north carolina property  and approximately  of insurance premiums reimbursed from our austin  texas  big flats  new york  and eatontown  new jersey properties 
expenses depreciation and amortization expenses of  were recorded for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  is a direct result of the acquisitions completed between december  and december   and properties acquired during that were held for the full year of the management advisory fee for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  is primarily a result of the increased time that our adviser s employees spent on our company matters  coupled with an increase in overhead expenses incurred by our adviser for our benefit 
the management advisory fee consists of the reimbursement of expenses  including direct allocation of employee salaries and benefits  as well as general overhead expense  to our adviser in accordance with the terms of the advisory agreement 
professional fees  consisting primarily of legal and accounting fees  were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily a result of the increased accounting fees related to the audit of our internal controls over financial reporting performed in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of  coupled with fees incurred to research franchise tax issues in various states  along with fees to file tax returns for our properties located in canada 
the professional fees for the audit of the financial statements also increased  coupled with increased legal fees incurred from the increased portfolio of investments 
taxes and licenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the payment of  of franchise taxes paid for doing business in certain states  of which approximately  is reimbursable from our tenants 
approximately  of these franchise taxes relate to taxes incurred in  however management has determined that these expenses were immaterial to our earnings  and accordingly  they were subsequently expensed in the quarter ending march  the remainder of the expense resulted from state registration and annual fees incurred by various entities created to acquire our properties in separate states 
we intend to attempt to reduce future incurrence of certain of these types of taxes next year by restructuring our entities in these specific states  however  we can not provide assurance that this restructuring will reduce the taxes in all states 
insurance expense increased to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  is a result of an increase in insurance premiums from the prior year  coupled with an increased number of properties that required insurance in interest expense was  for the year ended december  this amount consisted of  in unused line of credit fees on the line of credit obtained in february   in interest expense from borrowings against the line of credit   of interest expense on the mortgage notes payable  and  of amortization of deferred financing fees from long term financings 
we had no interest expense for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   and consisted mainly of directors fees  stockholder related expenses  recruiting expense and external management fees 
the increase of  or  was primarily a result of approximately  of fees that were written off related to a financing that did not close  coupled with increases in stockholder related expenses from the prior year as a result of increased fees paid to our transfer agent  and larger fees paid for an increased number of press releases and sec filings made during the year  partially offset by  of recruiting expense paid in and no recruiting expense paid in  coupled with a decrease in the costs associated with printing our annual report 
because we have only recently begun our operations  we do not believe that our current level of operating expenses relative to revenues is indicative of our operating expenses in the future 
as we continue to expand our real estate investments  we expect our revenues and operating expenses to increase and that ultimately our annual management advisory fee will be approximately of our invested assets 
interest income interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased during the year ended december  to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily a result of the increase in our portfolio of investments in real estate and mortgage loans  resulting in lower average cash balances invested 
this interest represents the interest earned on the investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in short term investment grade securities  primarily us treasury bills 
during the year ended december   we earned interest income on employee loans of  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  is a result of an employee loan that was originated during the third quarter of  and thus interest was only earned on this loan for a portion of the year ended december   and is also a result of our issuance of an additional employee loan in may of foreign currency loss net realized foreign currency transaction loss during the year ended december  was  which represents the loss in connection with the translation of monthly rental payments  the valuation of cash and quarterly tax payments denominated in canadian dollars 
net unrealized depreciation on the translation of assets and liabilities was  during the year ended december   which includes the valuation of the deferred rent asset and the mortgage notes payable 
the unrealized loss was primarily a result of the valuation of the mortgage notes payable because the value of the us dollar to the canadian dollar decreased by approximately between the date the notes were issued on july  and december  there was no foreign currency loss during the year ended december  net income for the year ended december   we recorded net income of  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  is primarily a result of the increase in our portfolio of investments in the past year and the corresponding increase in our revenues and the other events described above 
based on the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   the basic and diluted earnings per weighted average common share were both 
based on the basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of  and  respectively  for the year ended december   the basic and diluted earnings per weighted average common share were both comparison of the year ended december  to the period from february  inception to december  a comparison of the results of operations for the year ended december  to the period from february  inception to december  are not comparative because our operations had only recently begun  and there was minimal activity during this period 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from million at december  we have now fully invested the proceeds from our initial public offering  and have access to our existing line of credit and have obtained mortgages on of our properties 
we expect to obtain additional mortgages secured by some or all of our real property in the future 
we anticipate continuing to borrow funds and issuing additional equity securities to obtain additional capital 
to this end  and as described in greater detail below  we executed an underwriting agreement in connection with the public offering of  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  par value per share  at a price of per share  under our shelf registration statement on form s  and pursuant to the terms set forth in a prospectus dated october   as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement dated january  we expect that the funds from our line of credit  additional mortgages and securities offerings will provide us with sufficient capital to make additional investments and to fund our continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  which consisted of rental income and interest payments from our mortgage notes receivable  less payments made for interest on long term obligations  professional fees  insurance  taxes and licenses and other general operating expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  which consisted of rental income and interest payments from our mortgage note receivable  less payments made for professional fees  insurance  taxes and licenses and other general operating expenses investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was million  which consisted of the purchase of properties  as described in the investment section above  along with the origination of a mortgage loan  deposits placed on future acquisitions  and payments made to lenders for capital reserves partially offset by principal repayments from our mortgage notes receivable  receipts from tenants for capital reserves  and deposits applied against real estate investments

these amounts consisted primarily of the dividend payments to our stockholders 
future capital needs we had purchase commitments for three properties at december  in the aggregate amount of approximately million  where a deposit had been placed on the real estate as of december  subsequent to december   we made three investments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
as of december   we have investments in real properties for approximately million and two mortgage loans for approximately million 
during the remainder of and beyond  we expect to complete additional acquisitions of real estate and to extend additional mortgage notes 
the net proceeds of our initial public offering have been fully invested  and we intend to acquire additional properties by borrowing all or a portion of the purchase price and collateralizing the loan with mortgages secured by some or all of our real property  by borrowing against our existing line of credit  or by issuing additional equity securities 
we may also use these funds for general corporate needs 
if we are unable to make any required debt payments on any borrowings we make in the future  our lenders could foreclose on the properties collateralizing their loans  which could cause us to lose part or all of our investments in such properties 
registration statement on january  we completed the public offering of  shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  par value per share  at a price of per share  under our shelf registration statement on form s  and pursuant to the terms set forth in a prospectus dated october   as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement dated january  the preferred stock may be redeemed at a liquidation preference in the amount of per share plus any unpaid dividends at our election on or after january  these securities have no stated maturity  sinking fund or mandatory redemption and are not convertible into any other securities of the company

after completion of the offering  we still have million of common and preferred stock registered for future issuance pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
line of credit on february   we entered into a line of credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by branch banking trust company 
this line of credit initially provided us with up to million of financing  with an option to increase the line of credit up to a maximum of million upon agreement of the syndicate of banks 
on july   we amended the line of credit to increase the maximum availability under the line from million to million 
the line of credit matures on february  the interest rate charged on the advances under the facility is based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate  depending on market conditions  and adjusts periodically 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a fee of per year 
our ability to access this funding source is subject to us continuing to meet customary lending requirements such as compliance with financial and operating covenants and meeting certain lending limits and  as of december   we are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants 
for example  as is customary with such line of credit facilities  the maximum amount we may draw under this agreement is based on the percentage of the value of its properties meeting agreed upon eligibility standards that we have pledged as collateral to the banks 
as we arrange for long term mortgages for these properties  the banks will release the properties from the line of credit and reduce the availability under the line of credit by the advanced amount of the removed property 
conversely  as we purchase new properties meeting the eligibility standards  we may pledge these new properties to obtain additional advances under this agreement 
we may use the advances under the line of credit for both general corporate purposes and the acquisition of new investments 
as of december   there was million outstanding under the line of credit at an interest rate of per year

the note matures on june  contractual obligations the following table reflects our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period more than contractual obligations total less than year years years years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total long term debt obligations represent both borrowings under our bb t line of credit and mortgage notes payable that were outstanding as of december  the line of credit matures in february interest on long term debt obligations does not include interest on our borrowings under our line of credit 
the balance and interest rate is variable and  thus  the amount of interest can not be calculated for purposes of this table 
this does not include the portion of the operating lease on office space that is allocated to us by our adviser in connection with our advisory agreement 
the purchase obligations reflected in the above table represents commitments outstanding at december  to purchase real estate  million of which was subsequently closed in february funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed funds from operations ffo as a relative non gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states supplemental measure of operating performance of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo  as defined by nareit  is net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income loss and should not be considered an alternative to net income loss as an indication of our performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
comparison of ffo  using the nareit definition  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
basic funds from operations per share basic ffo per share and diluted funds from operations per share diluted ffo per share is ffo divided by weighted average common shares outstanding and ffo divided by weighted average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis  respectively  during a period 
we believe that ffo  basic ffo per share and diluted ffo per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for evaluating our ffo results in the same manner that investors use net income and earnings per share eps in evaluating net income available to common shareholders 
in addition  since most reits provide ffo  basic ffo and diluted ffo per share information to the investment community  we believe ffo  basic ffo per share and diluted ffo per share are useful supplemental measures for comparing us to other reits 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo  basic eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to basic ffo per share  and that diluted eps is the most directly comparable gaap measure to diluted ffo per share 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our ffo for the years ended december  and  and for the period from february  inception through december   to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income loss  and a computation of basic and diluted ffo per weighed average common share and basic and diluted net income per weighted average common share for the period february  for the year ended for the year ended inception through december  december  december  net income loss real estate depreciation and amortization funds from operations weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted basic net income loss per weighted average common share diluted net income loss per weighted average common share basic funds from operations per weighted average common share diluted funds from operations per weighted average common share item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the primary risks that we believe we will be exposed to are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently have two variable rate loans  certain of our leases contain escalations based on market interest rates  and the interest rate on our existing line of credit is variable 
we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions to contain a minimum interest rate or escalation rate  as applicable 
we are also exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of the holding of our cash and cash equivalents in short term  interest bearing investments 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net income  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum interest rate or escalation rate are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase in the one month libor rate by would increase our interest and rental revenue by  and increase our interest expense on the line of credit by  for a net decrease in our net income of approximately  or  over the next twelve months  compared to net income for the latest twelve months ended december  a hypothetical decrease in the one month libor by would decrease our interest and rental revenue by  and decrease our interest expense on the line of credit by  for a net increase in our net income of approximately  or  over the next twelve months  compared to net income for the latest twelve months ended december  although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan and lease portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
as of december   our fixed rate debt outstanding was approximately million 
interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments  using rates at december   had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
in the future  we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit or long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have purchased two properties in canada  and the monthly rental payments on these properties are received in canadian dollars 
in an effort to mitigate at least a portion of the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations  we have secured loans on the real estate properties in which the mortgage payments are denominated in canadian dollars 
while we have minimized the exchange rate risk  we are still exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate  as we have to convert the payments into us dollars at each transaction date and value the cash  deferred rent asset  and mortgage notes related to the canadian properties for the exchange rate at each balance sheet date 
for the year ended december   we had a  realized foreign currency transaction loss in connection with the translation of monthly rental payments  translation of cash balances and quarterly tax payments to canada  and a  loss from valuing the deferred rent asset and the mortgage notes payable related to the canadian properties at december  the unrealized loss was primarily a result of valuing the mortgage notes payable at the end of the year  as the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased by approximately from the date of issuance of the notes to december  to illustrate the potential impact of changes in exchange rates on our net income  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions beyond a minimum exchange rate fluctuation are taken to alter our existing foreign currency sensitivity 
under this analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar by would increase or decrease our net income by approximately  or  over the next twelve months  compared to net income for the latest twelve months ended december  although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing exchange rate sensitivity  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our real estate is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the creditworthiness of lessees  all of which may affect our ability to refinance debt if necessary
