item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we provide an enterprise level information technology solution for the clinical analysis and management of digital medical images within multi hospital networks  community hospitals and diagnostic imaging centers 
our solutions consist of advanced visualization and image management software for multiple medical specialties such as cardiology  radiology and orthopedics  comprehensive support services and third party components 
our web enabled advanced visualization software  which is hosted by the customer  provides physicians across the enterprise in multiple medical specialties and at any network access point with dynamic tools to manipulate and analyze images in both a d perspective and a d perspective 
with these tools  physicians have the ability to better understand internal anatomic structure and pathology  which can improve clinical diagnoses  disease screening and therapy planning 
our open standards based solutions are designed to help customers improve staff productivity  enhance revenue opportunities  automate complex medical imaging workflow  lower total cost of ownership and provide better service to physicians and patients 
we were founded in december as an alabama corporation and reincorporated in delaware in january since our first commercial implementation in december  we have experienced substantial growth and have implemented our solutions at facilities affiliated with some of the largest multi facility health care providers in the us our fiscal year ends on december references to  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended december  results overview total revenue for was million  which represents a increase over the increase was comprised of a increase in system sales revenue and a increase in support services revenue 
our overall gross margin percentage increased from for to for we achieved gross 
table of contents margin percentages of and for system sales and support services revenue  respectively  during  compared to and  respectively  for our net loss was million in compared to a net loss of million in this improvement was driven by revenue growth  margin expansion and expense control 
as of december   we had million in contracted backlog  consisting of fees for contracted future installations and for the support of existing installations  compared with a contracted backlog of million at december  we expect to recognize revenue from our current backlog of approximately million in and million in substantially all of the remaining million  which primarily consists of recurring revenue from support services  is expected to be recognized by our backlog will decrease as we recognize revenue under existing contracts  and it will increase as we enter into new contracts 
important developments on november   we acquired all the stock of camtronics medical systems  ltd  based in hartland  wisconsin  for million in cash 
we acquired all of camtronics assets  including its corporate headquarters campus in hartland  and all of camtronics liabilities 
we expect to substantially complete the integration of this business by the end of the third quarter of camtronics  founded in  is a leading provider of cardiology image and information management systems 
camtronics  which had revenue of million for its fiscal year ended july   currently serves a customer base that includes over hospitals 
in  frost and sullivan  a leading market research firm  named camtronics as one of the top five cardiology solution vendors in the united states 
including camtronics customers  our combined organization now has a customer base that includes approximately medical facilities 
on february   we completed our initial public offering of common stock 
we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
on february   our underwriters exercised the over allotment option to purchase  additional shares of our common stock at per share 
total proceeds from the initial public offering net of underwriting discount and offering expenses were million 
our market we believe the health information technology market is exhibiting the following trends increasing procedure volumes increasing procedure size modality blending  a layering of studies from two separate modalities for diagnostic and treatment purposes expanding adoption and use of standards increasing emphasis by healthcare providers and government agencies on electronic health record integration body transparency  a new paradigm for navigating through large volumes of information the amount of imaging data being generated by health care providers is growing extremely rapidly 
this data must be stored and made available for easy retrieval 
increasingly  health care information users want access to the stored data at any time  and in any location 
in addition  modalities that provide non invasive alternatives continue to expand into other clinical domains 
examples include mr and ct angiography multi detector ct for heart and chest imaging 
table of contents ct pet fusion cardiac catheterization one area that has received significant attention is advanced visualization  which uses d and other advanced analytic tools as key elements in an enterprise visual medical system 
earlier generation pacs have focused primarily on single departments and have utilized generic d tools 
a complete enterprise visualization system must not only support full d capabilities  but also include d tools  integrate easily into other information systems  and adhere to standards 
to understand these images  referring physicians need new tools that adapt to their specialty 
we expect that clinicians and specialists will soon consider enterprise visualization routine  since these images can be easier to understand and utilize 
our solutions can be extended to multiple stakeholders throughout the health care enterprise 
our solutions go beyond moving images from point a to point b to effectively distributing multi specialty tools and clinical content using a web enabled platform 
our solutions not only manage very complex datasets  but also perform advanced visualization such as d reconstruction and analysis within the viewing application  and distribute essential clinical tools through the network 
significant events in during the year ended december   we continued to focus on our core set of strategic goals 
in addition to the initial public offering of our stock and our acquisition of camtronics  we believe the following events were significant with respect to our goals during february  we entered into a ten year contract with sisters of st 
francis health services  inc  an integrated network of hospitals  clinics and associated facilities located in indiana and illinois 
during march  our quality management system received iso certification from the certification body  lloyd s register quality assurance  for both the madison  wisconsin and birmingham  alabama offices 
this certification is issued for the design and management of software manufacturing and for services used by healthcare provider organizations for the clinical analysis  management  storage  distribution and visualization of digital medical images and corresponding data 
during may  we announced enhancements to our advanced visualization software allowing radiologists and treating physicians to better use volume rendering and d navigation in one native  integrated  open standards package 
this improvement means physicians can utilize both d and d tools without having to resort to third party software and proprietary hardware to analyze medical images offering time savings and increased productivity 
during september  we received certification under the canadian medical device conformity assessment system recognizing our iso status in canada 
we also received our medical device license from health canada to allow us to market our products in canada 
we believe that there may be a strong opportunity for business with multi facility providers throughout the canadian marketplace 
during november  we entered into a contract with meridian health  a leading integrated delivery system serving central new jersey 
the agreement with meridian health represented our first combined sale of the emageon enterprise visual medical system with the full suite of camtronics cardiology imaging products 
during november  we entered into a contract with the johns hopkins hospital  a world renowned medical center headquartered in baltimore  maryland 
also during november  we entered into an agreement with orthocrat ltd 
to distribute traumacad  orthocrat s orthopedic surgical planning application 
this agreement allows us to further extend our enterprise vision by offering additional leading edge tools to orthopedic specialists in our customer base 

table of contents change in financial position as noted above  we completed our initial public offering during february the following significant changes in our financial position occurred as a result of the completion of the initial public offering we issued  shares of common stock upon the automatic conversion of outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock 
we sold  shares of common stock in connection with the public offering 
we issued  shares of common stock upon exercise of mandatorily redeemable warrants 
we received total cash proceeds net of underwriting discount and offering expenses of million 
with a portion of the proceeds  we repaid million of our subordinated debt 
we also recorded a non cash interest charge of million for the write off of the debt discount related to the subordinated debt 
we invested the remaining proceeds in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
in november  we utilized million of the cash proceeds to purchase camtronics medical systems  ltd 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock issued   shares of common stock outstanding  and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
sources of revenue a typical sale of our solution is comprised of system sales and support services 
revenue from system sales is derived from the licensing of our advanced visualization  clinical content management  and clinical workflow collectively referred to as our enterprise visual medical system  or evms and our heartsuite software products  as well as from sales and integration of third party components that are required to implement our solution 
support services revenue is derived from fees related to the implementation  training and on going customer support of our solution 
our software is comprised of four main components advanced visualization  our suite of software tools for the advanced visualization and analysis of digital medical images  clinical content management  our image archival and distribution management software  clinical workflow  our standards based software used to manage integration and data migration between our solution and other health information systems throughout the enterprise  and heartsuite  our suite of software tools focused on the cardiology department 
although clinical content management and heartsuite software products are available collectively as stand alone applications  we offer our software primarily as an integrated enterprise level image management solution 
license pricing for advanced visualization is primarily determined by either number of licenses or number of concurrent users 
license pricing for clinical content management and clinical workflow is determined based on projected volume and size of image studies to be stored or migrated by the particular customer 
license pricing for heartsuite software products is determined based on the number of workstations purchased 
we offer customers our software as perpetual or term licenses  in either case with maintenance and support relating to the software 
term licenses for our software are typically from two to ten years with annual renewals after the initial term 
the sale and integration of third party components typically include servers  data storage  backup and recovery systems  workstations and monitors  database software and computed radiography devices as well as orthopedic templates and dictation systems 
we also derive revenue from the provision of support services  including implementation  project planning  management  design and training services 
our customers typically contract for these support services pursuant to their initial agreements with us 
the initial term of these support services under these agreements range from one to ten years  with a typical duration of five years 
upon expiration of the initial term  these agreements typically renew automatically from year to year thereafter until terminated 

table of contents because our solutions represent capital expenditures involving multi year commitments  it can take a significant period of time to close a sale 
our evms solution has a typical sales cycle  from the initial contact to the placing of an order  of six to nine months  and sometimes much longer 
ascension health  the largest not for profit hospital system in the united states  is our largest customer 
revenue associated with facilities controlled by ascension health accounted for approximately of our total revenue during and approximately of our total contracted backlog at december  we anticipate that ascension health will continue to be a significant customer as we sign order addenda and contracts with additional ascension health facilities 
in  and  we had two  one and one customer  respectively  who each accounted for more than of our total revenue 
cost of revenue the cost of our solution is comprised of two elements the cost of our system sales and the cost of our support services 
the cost of system sales consists of the cost of third party components and the cost of software licenses 
the cost of our third party components consists primarily of direct and indirect expenses related to the purchase  manufacturing  shipment  installation and configuration of our solution 
the cost of our software licenses consists primarily of the amortization of acquired software  the amortization of capitalized software costs for internally developed software  and royalties paid for a component of our clinical content management software 
the cost of our support services consists primarily of labor costs and overhead relating to the implementation  installation  training  application support and maintenance of our solution as well as costs related to maintenance of third party components 
the cost of support services revenue varies based upon the productivity of our support services organization as well as costs associated with the use of outside contractors to support internal resources 
we allocate overhead expenses such as rent and occupancy charges and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of support services  as well as in the research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expense categories 
we currently own and lease to certain customers  under operating leases  third party components with a net book value of approximately million at december  these components relate to five customer installations completed in and we are depreciating these third party components to cost of support services revenue over the life of the respective contracts 
for the years ended december   and  depreciation related to these third party components of million  million and million  respectively  was included in cost of support services 
the majority of the contracts will expire by the third quarter of we have not entered into any agreements requiring us to lease third party components to customers since early and do not expect to do so in the future 
we anticipate that several of these customers will upgrade to our advanced visualization software from the existing third party visualization components that we lease to them 
gross profit our overall gross profit has improved due to an increase in software and recurring support services revenue derived from our growing installed base of customers 
we expect this trend to continue as our installed customer base continues to grow 
the gross profit from system sales varies based on several factors  including actual sales prices negotiated in the contracting process  amount of amortization of acquired software and internally developed capitalized software  costs associated with purchasing and manufacturing third party components  fluctuations in prices received from third party component manufacturers and distributors relative to the mark up percentages provided for in customer contracts 

table of contents the gross profit from sales of our support services varies based on several factors  including actual services fees negotiated during the contracting process  productivity of our professional service team  costs of service agreements related to third party components included in our solution  and costs associated with the use of outside contractors 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  allocated overhead  and outside contractors 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving the functionality  performance  and integration of our software products 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we strive to introduce additional products and services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including travel  marketing programs which include trade shows  workshops and seminars  corporate communications  other brand building activities  and advertising  allocated overhead and sales commissions 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our selling and marketing activities associated with existing and new product and service offerings to existing and new customers  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and operations  including additional compliance costs in connection with public company financial reporting requirements 
depreciation 
we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets  primarily consisting of building  machinery and equipment  computers and software  leasehold improvements and furniture  on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset  which is generally three to years 
stock based expenses 
our operating expenses and interest expense include the effects of stock based expenses related to the fair value of common stock options and warrants issued to non employees and stock option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was determined to be less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
ordinarily  we do not issue options with an exercise price below the then current fair market value 
however  certain options awarded prior to the completion of our initial public offering were determined to be below the appropriate fair market value at the time of issuance 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve the greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
we derive revenue from two primary sources system sales  which includes software license revenue and third party component sales  and support services  which includes fees related to implementation  training  software maintenance  ongoing customer support and third party component maintenance 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially 
table of contents governed by the provisions of aicpa statement of position  sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  in the application of this standard  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of system sales and support services revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 
we sell software under three types of licenses perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a customer based on a fixed number of users and or estimates of annual study volumes with no right to return the licensed software 
enterprise licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis to a customer typically a multi facility health care provider  as opposed to licensing based on a fixed number of users or on estimates of annual study volumes  with no right to return the licensed software 
term licenses software licensed on a term basis according to a fixed number of users and or estimates of annual study volumes 
generally  our software license arrangements do not include significant modification or customization of the underlying software and  as a result  we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
we assess each of the four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists it is our customary practice to have a written contract  which is signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement  prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred it is our customary practice to obtain acceptance for our software  which is evidenced by written customer acknowledgement 
in the event that we grant a customer the right to specified upgrades  we defer recognition of the entire arrangement fee until we deliver the specified upgrades as we have not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for specified upgrades 
specified upgrades include  but are not limited to  future software deliverables that are stated in the customer contract 
the customer s payment is deemed fixed or determinable we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties at the time of sale and recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
while our standard payment terms are net to days  we have  on a few occasions  extended payment terms beyond days but none greater than six months to creditworthy customers 
we have established a successful history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables  therefore satisfying the required criteria for revenue recognition 
if the fee is determined not to be fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amounts become due and payable 
collection is probable likelihood of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
both new and existing customers are subjected to a credit review that evaluates such customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
for follow on sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis if all other criteria are met 
we account for software license and non recurring support services revenue included in multiple element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements ie  software maintenance and ongoing support services based on vsoe of fair value is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements ie  software license and non recurring support services 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more of the undelivered services does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those services occurs or fair value can be established 
we determine vsoe of fair value for ongoing support services revenue based upon the renewal rates for the maintenance and ongoing support  which coincide with our pricing model 
significant incremental 
table of contents discounts offered in multiple element arrangements that would be characterized as separate elements are infrequent and are allocated to software license revenue under the residual method 
for term license arrangements  we recognize revenue for the multiple element arrangement over the term of the arrangement beginning in the month after we receive customer acceptance  provided that the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
software maintenance services generally include rights to upgrades when and if available  telephone support  updates and bug fixes 
software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
we include the first year of software maintenance in the software license fee 
we defer this software maintenance fee based on its fair value and recognize it ratably over the first year of the arrangement 
ongoing support services generally include telephone support related to third party components as well as quarterly customer metric reporting and other services 
ongoing support service revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the ongoing support services contract on a straight line basis when all the revenue recognition requirements are met 
as it relates to services  the company may also provide services that vary depending on the scope and complexity requested by the customer 
examples of such services include additional database consulting  system configuration  existing systems interface  and network consulting 
these services generally are not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the software 
if the company has vsoe of fair value for the services  the timing of the software license revenue is not impacted  and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
the company commonly performs services for which the company does not have vsoe of fair value  accordingly  the software license revenue is deferred until the services are completed 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no   revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed and determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
the company classifies shipping and handling cost in cost of system sales 
when our contracts contain both software and third party components  we recognize revenue related to third party components that are stated separately in our contracts according to guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
third party component revenue  including hardware sales and hardware maintenance  is recognized in accordance with contractual terms 
when we are responsible for installing the third party components  revenue is recognized when the third party components are delivered  installed and accepted by the customer 
when we are not responsible for installing the third party components  revenue is recognized when the third party components are delivered to the customer 
we qualify to recognize hardware sales and hardware maintenance under eitf as a result of the following factors our software is not essential to the functionality of the hardware  our customers have the ability to purchase the hardware from other vendors and the purchase price of the hardware and hardware maintenance is separately stated in our contracts 
when third party components and related maintenance are not separately priced in our contracts  we recognize revenue related to the arrangement when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the following is a summary of our product warranty and guarantee and our related accounting policies for these agreements our sales agreements with customers generally contain infringement indemnity provisions 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of any required defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer  if any 
our infringement indemnity provisions typically give us the option to make modifications of the product so it is no longer infringing or  if it cannot be corrected  to require the customer to return the product in exchange for a specified payment for loss of use 
our sales agreements with customers 
table of contents sometimes also contain indemnity provisions for death  personal injury or property damage caused by our personnel or contractors in the course of performing services to customers 
under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with death  personal injury and property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of any required defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer  if any 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date but typically limit the amount of award covered to a portion of the fees paid by the customer over a portion of the contract term 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification provisions 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  we warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer as long as the contract remains in effect 
additionally  we warrant that our services will be performed by qualified personnel in a manner consistent with normally accepted industry standards 
we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history 
as of december  we have million of liabilities recorded for these agreements 
our standard contracts with customers typically provide for a guarantee of system availability and a guarantee of component availability  with penalty provisions if our solution fails to meet the guarantees 
our system availability guarantee covers our solution as a whole  while the component guarantee covers each individual component  as in certain circumstances a component may fail without affecting system availability 
the penalty provisions in our contracts typically allow the customer a reduction in software maintenance fees related to failure to meet guaranteed uptime percentages 
we calculate these penalties as a percentage of the software maintenance fee and would reduce the amount of the software maintenance fee charged in a specific period for these penalties  if incurred 
to date  we have not incurred any penalties associated with these guarantees 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  billings may not coincide with the recognition of revenue 
unbilled revenue  which is included in accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet  occurs when revenue recognition precedes billing to the customer  and arises primarily from sales with predetermined billing schedules 
billings in excess of sales deferred revenue occur when billing to the customer precedes revenue recognition  and arise primarily from sales with partial prepayments upon contract execution and from maintenance revenue billed in advance of performance of the maintenance activity 
the company recognizes deferred revenue  as applicable  upon delivery and acceptance of products  as ongoing services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
costs related to deferred revenue are included as an asset in the company s consolidated balance sheet and charged to expense when the related deferred revenue is recognized 
the timing of customer acceptances could significantly affect our results of operations during a given period 
as noted above  we require written acknowledgement from the customer to evidence that delivery of the products or services has occurred 
delays in the implementation process could negatively affect operations in a given period by increasing volatility in revenue recognition 
research and development costs 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
however  costs incurred for the development of software that will be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized as incurred after technological feasibility has been established and capitalization ceases when the software is generally available for release 
judgment is involved in determining when technological feasibility is reached 
we believe that technological feasibility is reached when we have completed a working model that is ready to be beta tested at a customer site 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in technologies 
costs deemed not recoverable are charged to expense 
costs that are capitalized primarily consist of direct labor 

table of contents amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the product is available for general release 
amortization is provided on a product by product basis using the straight line method over periods not exceeding three years 
intangible and other long lived assets 
us generally accepted accounting principles require the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations after june   and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
accordingly  we identified and allocated values to the intangibles based on discounted cash flow analyses and market research  as well as our judgment 
intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we will evaluate intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and also when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenue  which is inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
historically  intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
property  equipment and intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives of the intangible assets are based on management s estimates of the periods over which such assets will generate revenue 
results of operations revenue revenue consists of system sales and support services revenue 
system sales revenue is comprised of revenue from sales of our software and third party components 
support services revenue is comprised of revenue from up front professional services such as implementation  adoption and training  as well as ongoing maintenance services 
the following table sets forth revenue component data 
year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages system sales percentage of total revenue support services percentage of total revenue total revenue the increase in system sales revenue from to was attributable to an increase in the number of new and existing customer installations offset by a decrease in the size of these installations  as well as the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue 
during  we had more acceptances of our software and third party components than in the average revenue recognized per acceptance excluding outliers  such as unusually small or large dollar amounts decreased slightly in as compared to as our pricing has not changed significantly from the prior year  the decrease is primarily related to an increase in add on sales to our existing customer base  which tend to be smaller than initial sales to new customers 
also  during  we recognized system sales revenue of million related to two contracts for which we deferred revenue in as a result of the existence of certain undelivered upgrades 
we delivered the additional software features during the second and fourth quarters of and  as a result of all revenue recognition criteria being met  we recognized the system sales revenue associated with these contracts 
the increase in system sales revenue from to was attributable to more health care institutions buying and installing our solution  an increase in average contract value and a shift in our sales from primarily term licenses  in which revenue is recognized ratably over the multiple years covered by the licenses  to primarily perpetual licenses  in which revenue for the license fee is recognized at system acceptance assuming all applicable revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

table of contents the increase in support services revenue from to was attributable to an increase in customer installations 
approximately million of the increase in support services revenue for was attributable to an increased number of customers that have implemented our solution and are paying us ongoing support and maintenance fees 
also included in this million increase is the recognition of million of revenue related to the contracts mentioned above for which we deferred revenue in as a result of the existence of undelivered upgrades 
we delivered the additional software features during the second and fourth quarters of and  as a result of all revenue recognition criteria being met  we recognized the support services revenue attributable to the previously provided services for which we had deferred support services revenue 
the remaining million increase was related to the increase in the recognition of non recurring revenue related to services such as implementation and training for new customers as well as add on services for existing customers 
the increase in support services revenue from to was attributable to an increase in customer installations 
approximately million of the increase in support services revenue for  was attributable to an increased number of customers that have implemented our solution and are paying us ongoing support and maintenance fees 
the remaining million increase was related to the increase in the recognition of non recurring revenue related to services such as implementation and training for new customers as well as add on services for existing customers 
in general  the increased number of customer installations was a result of increased customer awareness and acceptance of our products and services with multi facility healthcare providers 
of the software acceptances received during and  and  respectively  related to agreements with multi facility healthcare providers 
we expect revenue to continue to increase as we recognize revenue from our existing long term customer agreements while also recognizing revenue related to new customer agreements 
we also believe that support services as a percentage of total revenue will continue to increase as compared to prior periods as our customer base expands 
cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of costs associated with system sales and support services revenue 
system sales cost of revenue is comprised of the cost of third party components and the cost of software licenses 
support services cost of revenue is comprised of labor costs and related overhead relating to the implementation  installation  training  application support and maintenance of our solution as well as costs related to maintenance of third party components 
the following table sets forth cost of revenue component data 
year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages cost of system sales revenue percentage of system sales revenue cost of support services revenue percentage of support services revenue total cost of revenue percentage of total revenue the increase in total cost of revenue was attributable to increased purchases of third party components and  to a lesser extent  increased labor costs  as a result of the increased number and size of new customer installations 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was a result of the increase in the number of software acceptances received for which we recognized revenue as compared to the 
table of contents corresponding prior periods 
our costs associated with software licenses as a percentage of total revenue are significantly lower than costs associated with other components of our revenue 
for the years ended december  and  cost of system sales increased by and  respectively  as compared to and these increases were caused by the increased number of health care institutions that acquired and installed our solution 
we anticipate that our cost of revenue will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of additional purchases of third party components related to customer installations  which purchases are in turn driven by our increase in customers 
cost of system sales as a percentage of system sales revenue decreased in and as compared to and a portion of the decrease in is attributable to the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue during the second and fourth quarters of as a result of the timing of the revenue recognition  there were minimal costs associated with this revenue when it was recognized 
for the years ended december  and  cost of support services increased by and  respectively  as compared to and these increases were caused by an increase in staffing levels in our support services teams as well as increased costs to maintain third party components due to an increase in volume 
cost of support services as a percentage of support services revenue decreased in and presented above as compared to and the decrease in cost of support services as a percentage of total support services revenue was a result of efficiencies realized as our customer base grew and the cost of support services was spread over the broader base of customers 
our management team has focused on ensuring the professional services and support departments achieve the benefits associated with efficiencies of scale as a result of our increased customer base 
these initiatives include departmental reorganizations  investments in software technologies  use of external consultants to gauge best practices  and use of more cost effective resources 
gross margin percentage our gross margin percentage increased from of total revenue for to of total revenue for to of total revenue for these improvements were primarily a result of increased revenue attributable to software license acceptances earning higher margins than other components of our revenue as well as efficiencies realized as our customer base has expanded 
research and development r d year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages r d expense of revenue the increases in research and development expense for the twelve months ended december  and as compared to corresponding periods in and  respectively  are mainly attributable to increases in personnel  both through internal growth and growth through acquisitions of other companies 
during the twelve months ended december   personnel and related expenses accounted for million of the expense growth compared to the corresponding period in in addition  camtronics  which we acquired november   contributed million of personnel expense during the two months included in consolidated expenditures 
an increase of million in research and development cost for the twelve months ended december  from the corresponding period in is attributable to personnel increases throughout along with the inclusion of a full year of expense from personnel added through the ultravisual merger in may headcount has increased from employees at december  to employees at december   including the employees added through the camtronics acquisition 
along with the integration of the research and development teams  the department has reorganized into operating divisions that we believe will provide increased productivity and efficiency during the development phase of a software release and lead to more effective product roadmaps 

table of contents increased spending for outside consultants accounted for approximately million and million of the increases for the twelve months ended december  and december   respectively 
a portion of the spending has been focused on enhancing our use of low cost consultants that are engaged in quality development and service activities in support of an expanding r d employee base 
the remaining spending has been targeted on consultants and developers that assist our personnel in product quality assurance and validation  system framework implementations  and internal network administration 
investments have been made to develop testing programs and aid development of software releases 
significant expenditures have been made to purchase engineering laboratory equipment and expand our laboratory and testing environments 
the additional expenditures are reflected in a growing asset base and increased depreciation expense included in the general and administrative line item 
sales and marketing s m year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages s m expense of revenue continued growth in sales and marketing expense for each of the last two years demonstrates our commitment to extend our product base to current and prospective customers through sales efforts  targeted marketing  and acquisitions 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue from in to in is evidence of the efficient use of these expenditures and the leveraging of our sales and marketing efforts in the marketplace 
the additional expenditures have mainly been focused on additional headcount in both direct sales and sales and marketing support teams 
sales and marketing headcount increased to employees at december   from employees at december  and employees at december  through the camtronics acquisition  we added ten direct sales representatives focused on selling cardiology products to existing and new customers 
the remainder of the additional personnel have augmented our client sales group and marketing support group 
the client sales group primarily focuses on support and development of current relationships with large hospitals and hospital networks 
the additional increases in marketing support have been focused on expanding the product demonstration team and product marketing teams 
the product demonstration team has also been equipped with new tools and technology that have created enhanced avenues for potential customers to evaluate our visualization technology 
accompanying the increased headcount are increased expenditures related to training  communications and technology that have increased the effectiveness and productivity of our sales and marketing personnel 
additional personnel expenses that include associated costs such as travel  training  and communications  but exclude commissions  have added million in expenses to the twelve months ended december  compared to and million to the twelve months ended december  compared to commission expense increased million from the twelve month period ended december  to the twelve month period ended december  the increase is attributable to the increase in contract signings in even though commission expense increased in absolute terms  the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue noted earlier is the result of a change in our sales commission plans 
in late  we changed our sales commission plans so that a portion of the commission payment is linked to customer acceptance 
in addition  in we changed our commission plans so that commission expense is recognized over the periods the payments are earned rather than in the period the payments are paid 
both of these revisions had the effect of delaying payments and expense to future periods 
for the twelve month period ended december  commissions remained relatively stable with the comparable period in stability in commission expense even though both contract sales and personnel expense increased is primarily related to the timing and type of contracts closed and accepted during the respective periods 
commission expense for the year ended december  reflected greater than usual commission expense related to the execution of master contracts for large network customers 
the twelve 
table of contents months ended december  reflects reduced average payments and expense of commissions related to the execution of contract addenda in association with existing customer master contracts 
commission payments related to the execution of master contract addenda are lower than the payments for new customer contracts  as commissions related to the original master contracts have already been paid or are being paid and expensed on a monthly basis over the period of the master contract initial commitment 
commissions for new contract addenda that are included in the master contract are typically paid based on contract revenue above and beyond the levels in the master contract for that particular site  therefore  although the new contract addenda related to these master contracts represent major new installations  the incremental commission expense associated with these addenda is less than the corresponding level for a similarly sized new contract 
in addition  as described earlier  the majority of new hires have filled primarily support roles that have compensation plans with lower commission levels than direct sales personnel 
thus  we have seen significant increases in personnel expenses without significant increases in commission expense 
direct marketing expense increased during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in by million 
the increase is related to expenditures targeted to increase awareness of our products in the marketplace 
conversely  direct marketing expense decreased during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in by million 
the decrease in direct marketing expenses reflects a focused attempt to grow our market presence with a more efficient use of expenditures 
we have directed funds towards industry trade shows that provide opportunities for us to display our product to a wider  more knowledgeable customer base through the utilization of state of the art booths and exhibits 
we have also internally developed and published a periodic industry magazine that promotes industry specific topics while providing brand name awareness 
we believe that all of the efforts discussed above have augmented our reputation in the marketplace and should help deliver continued growth in the future 
we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses at a steady  controlled pace as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and focus on increasing market awareness of our products and service offerings 
general and administrative g a year ended december  year ended december  change change change change in thousands except percentages in thousands except percentages g a expense of revenue as expected  our general and administrative expense have grown in absolute terms from to to these additional expenditures are in support of our increasing employee base and are a natural result of the growth of our company as a whole 
the majority of the increases can be broken down into the following categories administrative expense has increased million and million for the twelve months ended december   and december   as compared to corresponding periods in and  respectively 
the increases occurred in insurance  accounting and legal fees  consultants  and other professional fees mainly as a result of our becoming a public company in and associated expenses incurred for compliance and regulatory affairs 
depreciation expense has increased million and million for the twelve months ended december   and december   as compared to corresponding periods in and  respectively  mainly as a result of increased purchases of employee computer equipment  server equipment for the internal engineering laboratory  and testing equipment 
stock based compensation has increased million and million for the twelve months ended december   and december   as compared to corresponding periods in and  respectively 
the majority of stock options with an intrinsic value were issued during and the beginning of  thus we recorded minimal expense during the first nine months of periodic stock based compensation has remained consistent during as fewer options have been granted 

table of contents personnel expense has increased million and million for the twelve months ended december   and december   as compared to corresponding periods in and new employees have been added in the accounting  human resources and general administrative functions in support of our increased employee base and increased amount of administrative transactions and activity 
in addition  associated costs such as travel  communications and rent have increased in conjunction with the growth in our employee base 
although our general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of becoming a public company  our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have decreased as a result of revenue growth 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of becoming a public company and also as a result of our continued growth 
specifically  we expect to incur increased costs associated with accounting  consulting  legal and other professional services  increased insurance costs and increased personnel in our finance  legal and human resources functions 
by way of example  although we have not previously been involved in any type of significant litigation  we recognize that most companies from time to time may be the subject of customer or other complaints  and that such complaints could result in litigation 
in such a case  it is likely that our external legal expenses would increase 
amortization and write off of intangible assets related to camtronics acquisition during  we estimated that million of the purchase price of camtronics represented acquired in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
the value of the ipr d was determined with the assistance of an independent third party appraiser by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies and taking into consideration stage of completion  complexity of work to date and to complete  anticipated product development and introduction schedules  forecasted product sales cycles  internal and external risk factors  revenue and operating expense estimates  contributory asset charges  and costs already incurred and the expected costs to complete 
the remainder of the expense was related to straight line amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of camtronics  such as customer relationships and trade names  which are being amortized over periods from one to six years 
the estimated asset lives of the amortizable intangible assets are determined based on projected future economic benefits and expected life cycles of the intangible assets 
integration costs related to camtronics acquisition we incurred integration costs of million in as a result of the november acquisition of camtronics 
integration costs are comprised primarily of costs of transitional employees and other contractors as well as travel costs 
we anticipate that integration costs related to this acquisition will result in additional charges in the first half of operating income loss for the year ended december   operating loss decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  operating loss as a percentage of total revenue improved from a negative for the year ended december  to a negative for the year ended december  for the year ended december   operating loss decreased by million as compared to the year ended december  operating loss as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  these improvements are a result of the total revenue increase  increases in gross margin  and the increased leverage in operating costs discussed above 

table of contents other income and expense for the year ended december   interest income increased by million over this increase is a result of investing the proceeds from our initial public offering 
for the year ended december   interest expense increased by million as compared to primarily as a result of a non cash interest charge of million for the write off of subordinated debt discount  offset by a reduction in interest expense from our repayment of million of subordinated debt with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
quarterly results of operations the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for the eight most recent quarters 
the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this filing and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for such periods 
this data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this filing

we discuss below some of the larger fluctuations in various line items in the table above 

table of contents revenue 
during the first quarter of each calendar year  the two components of our total revenue have declined from the immediately preceding quarter due to timing issues relating to our sales and installation process 
this impact is particularly evident for our system sales revenue 
in the past  we have experienced lower sales volumes in the third quarter of each year relative to other quarters 
we believe that this is the result of the historical capital expenditure patterns of our customer base 
this  in turn  has caused our revenue in the first quarter of the following year to be lower in comparison to the immediately preceding quarter due to the length of our installations and our revenue recognition policies 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue fluctuates from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in the relative contributions to our revenue from system sales and support services and changes in the productivity of support services personnel 
operating expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses fluctuate due to timing of sales 
also  the most significant trade show that we attend occurs within the fourth quarter of each year  increasing our sales and marketing expenses in that quarter 
operating income loss 
our quarterly operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate 
some important additional factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers  attract new customers and satisfy our customers requirements  our ability to successfully integrate our acquisition of camtronics  length of the sales cycle for our solution  implementation delays at customer sites  whether within or outside our control  renewal rates for our solutions  changes in our pricing policies  new product introductions and product enhancements by us or our competitors  effectiveness of our sales force  buying and capital budgeting patterns of our customers  our success in selling our solutions to large multi facility health care providers  technical difficulties or downtime in our solutions  general economic conditions in the us  additional investments in our solutions or operations  and regulatory compliance costs 
significant changes in the historical patterns of these factors or the occurrence of unforeseen events could cause our operating results to vary widely 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  our net cash position was as follows in thousands except ratios december working capital current ratio cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities short term borrowings and long term debt current ratio is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
the increase in our working capital  current ratio  and cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities is due to million of net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock that was completed in february offset by our million acquisition of camtronics in november the large decrease in short term borrowings and long term debt from december  to december  is a result of our repayment of million of our subordinated debt with a portion of the proceeds from the initial public offering and scheduled debt retirement on other debt 
operating activities during the year ended december   cash used in operations was million  which primarily related to our net loss of million and changes in working capital accounts 
we experienced significant increases in trade accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and inventory to be sold to customers during the year 
our accounts receivable balance increased as a result of the timing of customer acceptances as well as the timing of new customer contracts 
prepaid expenses increased as a result of the existence of numerous annual hardware maintenance contract renewals for customer third party components during the period for which expenses are recognized on a monthly basis over the contract periods 
our inventory increased as a result of the timing of acceptances of third party components at customer sites 
our weighted average collection period for accounts receivable as of december  was days compared to days at december  we calculate weighted average collection period based on average days outstanding per customer based on historical experience and then weight these days outstanding based on proportional dollar value of the accounts receivable balance at the end of the period 
the changes in other working capital accounts were primarily driven by increased volume of operations and the timing of cash payments 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million  which consisted of an increase of million from changes in working capital accounts and a decrease of million as a result of our net loss  offset by non cash items 
changes in the working capital accounts primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable  an increase in prepaid expenses  an increase in third party components to be sold to customers  increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses and an increase in deferred revenue due to an increased customer base and timing of customer payments

approximately million of the purchases for related to investments in equipment for internal use  including test equipment for our research and development and quality assurance departments as well as computer equipment and furniture for new and existing personnel 
approximately million and million of the purchases for and  respectively  related to computer equipment for new and existing personnel 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment for internal use as necessary  consistent with growth of the company 
approximately million  million and million of the purchases for  and  respectively  related to investments in equipment located at contracted customer sites 
we anticipate that we will incur additional capital expenditures at customer sites as we further standardize and update our hardware platform 
in november  we used million to acquire all the stock of camtronics medical systems  ltd  based in hartland  wisconsin 
we acquired all of camtronics assets  including its corporate headquarters campus in hartland  and all of camtronics liabilities 
we used million for the purchase of marketable securities and received proceeds of million upon the maturity or sale of some of these securities during the marketable securities consist of us government agency obligations and corporate commercial paper  all with maturities of less than one year 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities for resulted primarily from the completion of our initial public offering 
this inflow of cash was offset by our million repayment of our subordinated debt and other payments on borrowings 
during  we also had million of restricted cash released from restriction 
the cash provided by financing activities for resulted from proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt of million  which was later repaid upon completion of our initial public offering  offset by payments on existing borrowings and an addition to restricted cash used to secure a letter of credit for an operating lease 
the cash provided by financing activities for resulted from proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million offset by payments on existing borrowings and a purchase of treasury stock 
the following table summarizes  as of december   the general timing of future payments including payments of interest under our outstanding loan agreements  lease agreements and other long term contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than contractual cash obligations total year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations in august  we executed a new operating lease for rental space for our madison  wisconsin office 
the lease term ends january  monthly lease payments of  begin in february and increase annually on each august st until the end of the lease term 

table of contents in april  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank under which we can borrow up to million subject to certain restrictions 
interest accrues at the prime rate plus to  depending on our net income 
this line of credit was amended as of july  and expires april  at which time all advances will be due and payable 
as of december  we had no outstanding balance under this line of credit 
any borrowings under the agreement are secured by certain assets of the company  including cash and receivables 
we anticipate renewal of this agreement upon its expiration under terms and conditions no less favorable as in the existing agreement 
we believe our existing cash  together with future cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our loan and security agreement  if necessary  will be sufficient to execute our business plan in however  any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
our future cash requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and services  enhancements to existing products and services  the amount and form of consideration we may issue in acquisition or similar transactions  and the continuing market acceptance of our solution 
to the extent that our existing cash  together with future cash flows from operations and availability under our loan and security agreement are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any binding agreement or letter of intent with respect to any other potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
it is possible that additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases entered into for ordinary business purposes  we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  or with entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires publicly traded companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
sfas r supersedes apb  which the company has followed for all periods through december  sfas r will be effective for the company at the beginning of the fiscal first quarter of sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or canceled after that date 
compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite services have not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for periods before the required effective date  sfas r allows elective adjustment of the financial statements of prior periods on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by sfas upon adoption in the first quarter of  the company will not restate prior periods 
the company expects to record additional costs relating to compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas r  however  the precise effect of adoption has not been predicted at this time because it will 
table of contents depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the characteristics of our stock on the date of grant  as well as the actual forfeiture rates we experience 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
clarifies the accounting for inventory when there are abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials 
under existing us generally accepted accounting principles  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges rather than recorded as adjustments to the value of the inventory 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after the date sfas no 
was issued 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes in the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires that a change in method of depreciation or amortization for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt instruments do not expose us to material market risks relating to changes in interest rates 
some of the proceeds of our initial public offering have been invested in short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities pending their application 
the value of these securities will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
the effect of a hypothetical one hundred basis point decrease across all interest rates related to our investments would result in an annual decrease of approximately million in operating results assuming no further changes in the amount of our investments outstanding at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable debt securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature within one year 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus reducing the need to sell or redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments
