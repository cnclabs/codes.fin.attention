significant accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed description of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
real estate investments the company applies financial accounting standards board statement no  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement to measure impairment in real estate investments 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis without interest from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is les s than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
securities available for sale investments in non real estate assets consist primarily of marketable securities 
management individually reviews and evaluates our marketable securities for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur 
management considers  among other things  credit aspects of the issuer  amount of decline in fair value over cost and length of time in a continuous loss position 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized in earnings and the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as the new cost basis 
the company s securities consist primarily of debt securities and common and preferred stock of other reits 
these securities are all publicly traded and purchased on the open market or through dividend reinvestment plans 
these securities are classified among three categories held to maturity  trading and available for sale 
as of december  and  the company s securities are all classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value based upon quoted market prices 
gains or losses on the sale of securities are based on identifiable cost and are accounted for on a trade date basis 
unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity until realized 
other estimates are used when accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  potentially excess and obsolete inventory and contingent liabilities  among others 
these estimates are susceptible to change and actual results could differ from these estimates 
the effects of changes in these estimates are recognized in the period they are determined
