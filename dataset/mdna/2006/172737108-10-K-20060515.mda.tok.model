risk factors 
our business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  involve risks or uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond our control 
understanding how these factors may affect our business is important to understanding information about the company in this annual report on form k and our other filings and releases 
our discussion below contains forward looking statements  as discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
you should read the discussion below in conjunction with our md a  and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
page of 
table of contents we face intense  multi channel competition from a variety of competitors that could negatively impact our financial performance 
in order to achieve positive results  we must compete successfully in the consumer electronics industry against large specialty retailers  discount or warehouse retailers  home office retailers  internet based retailers  direct to consumer alternatives and local or regional retailers 
many of our vendors and suppliers have opened retail store locations and increased their direct sales to consumers 
because of the size and strong performance of some of our competitors  they may promote merchandise more aggressively and offer more attractive financing and discount prices for extended periods of time  which could adversely affect our profit margin 
if we cannot respond adequately to these multiple sources and types of competition  it could adversely impact customer traffic  market share and overall financial performance 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified associates at all levels within the company  which could adversely affect our sales performance  cost structure and competitive position within the industry 
we must recruit and retain a large number of qualified associates in order to perform successfully 
we face intense competition for associates at all levels of the company  and we compete in job markets nationally 
many of our associates are in entry level or part time positions  which typically have high levels of turnover 
our ability to maintain appropriate staffing levels while controlling labor costs is subject to a number of external factors such as the quality of the labor market in our trade areas  unemployment levels  prevailing wages  changing demographics  health insurance costs and state labor and employment requirements 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates  then our sales performance may be adversely impacted or our labor costs may increase significantly 
in addition  we have made a number of management changes focused on improving the level of talent at the management and executive levels within the company 
if we are unable to retain key managers and executives  then it may be difficult for us to maintain a competitive position within the industry or to implement strategic changes in the future 
failure to effectively manage our inventory levels could adversely affect our financial results 
we rely on a best sourcing strategy where we procure merchandise from a variety of sources and methods  including new and existing vendors  reverse auctions  global sourcing capability within the company and direct relationships with manufacturers 
we depend on strong and stable supplier relationships and accurate forecasts of customer demand 
reduced consumer spending or lack of consumer interest in our products could lead to excess inventory levels  alternatively  if we do not have adequate inventory to respond to customer demand for products  we may lose sales to competitors 
additionally  we may inaccurately forecast product life cycles or end of life products  leaving us with excess inventory 
as a result  we may be forced to lower our prices  adversely impacting margins and financial results 
we may be unable to relocate successfully or open new stores in desirable locations  which could adversely affect our ability to increase sales and achieve profitable growth 
our store revitalization program is an important part of our business plan 
we have a significant number of stores in older formats or in locations where the trade area has shifted away from our target market 
we continue to refine our store prototypes and seek real estate in smaller trade areas and urban locations in addition to larger markets 
when we open new stores in markets where we already have a presence  our existing locations may experience a decline in sales as a result 
for our store revitalization program to be successful  we must identify and lease favorable store sites  construct the building  and hire and train associates for the new location 
in many locations  we face intense competition from other retailers for both real estate and qualified associates 
construction  environmental  zoning and real estate delays may negatively impact store openings and increase costs and capital expenditures 
we cannot be certain that new or relocated stores will produce the anticipated sales or return on investment or that existing stores will not be adversely affected by new or expanded competition in their market areas 
consumers may not upgrade televisions or buy related audio products  home theater products or services at the rate we expect during the next few years  which would adversely affect our growth  revenues and margins 
because of the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting  we have invested significant inventory  store space and labor in the advanced television category 
we expect a large number of consumers to replace analog television sets in the next three years and to purchase related audio products  home theater products and services at the same time 
set top converters and other technology will permit consumers to continue to use analog televisions even after broadcasting is converted to a digital signal 
as a result  if consumers do not embrace advanced television at the levels we expect  our growth  revenues and margins may be negatively impacted 
page of 
table of contents we may not be able to successfully execute our multi channel marketing strategy  which could adversely affect our growth  revenues and margins 
our direct to consumer business has grown rapidly since the launch of our web site in we have invested heavily in marketing our in store pickup process for web orders  and we have initiated a catalog offering that allows consumers to order products by phone 
these efforts are intended to attract new customers and increase sales from existing customers  but they could result in customers making fewer trips to our brick and mortar stores 
it may be more challenging for us to increase sales of extended warranties  services and accessories as customers move toward greater online shopping 
in addition  competitive pricing on the internet and the ability of online customers to perform better price comparisons could negatively impact traffic  average ticket sales and profit margins 
issues associated with re branding and fluctuating exchange rates could adversely affect the financial results of our international segment 
we operate an international segment business  which is primarily engaged in the business of selling private label and brand name consumer electronics products in canada 
this segment consists of the operations of intertan  inc  which is involved in ongoing litigation with radioshack corporation 
as a result of this litigation  the international segment re branded most of its company owned stores and dealer outlets to the trade name the source by circuit city sm 
although re branding efforts are complete  future sales and customer loyalty may be negatively impacted 
in addition  conversion of canadian dollar denominated sales into us dollars may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations  and fluctuating exchange rates could cause reduced gross revenues and or gross margins from non us dollar denominated international sales 
our business is heavily dependent upon information systems  which require upgrades that may be expensive or difficult to implement  and which could result in higher costs and business disruption 
our information systems include in store point of sale systems that provide information used to track sales performance by associates  inventory replenishment  e commerce product availability  product margin information and customer information 
in addition  we have or are implementing systems for data warehousing  merchandising and supply chain  planning  and marketing 
these systems are complex and require integration with each other and with business processes 
if we encounter difficulty implementing new systems or maintaining and upgrading current systems  then our business operations could be disrupted and our expenses could increase 
our business is subject to quarterly fluctuations and seasonality  which leaves our financial and operating results vulnerable to temporary unfavorable conditions that may impact key selling periods 
the most significant portion of our revenue is generated during the period that begins with thanksgiving  includes the holiday shopping season and continues until the super bowl 
the majority of this period occurs in the company s fourth fiscal quarter 
as a result  any factors negatively affecting us during this time of year  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability for the entire year 
in addition  other key holiday weekends during the year  such as memorial day  fourth of july and labor day  bring disproportionately high revenues for the quarter in which they fall  relative to non holiday weekends  and also leave us somewhat vulnerable to adverse impacts from temporary unfavorable conditions 
general economic conditions or a decline in consumer discretionary spending may adversely impact our sales in a disproportionate fashion 
we sell products and services that consumers tend to view as conveniences rather than necessities 
as a result  our results of operations are more sensitive to changes in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending  including discretionary spending 
future economic conditions such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  energy costs and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits 
a general reduction in the level of consumer spending or our inability to respond to shifting consumer attitudes regarding products  store location and other factors could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we may not be able to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand  preferences and patterns  which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
the consumer electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  obsolescence and price erosion 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to consumer demand and preferences for new items 
the introduction and availability of new products are often controlled by manufacturers and may be subject to the cooperation of third parties such as television broadcasters and wireless providers 
we may be adversely impacted by limited quantities of new products 
the introduction of new technologies may negatively impact sales of existing products 
significant deviations from the page of 
table of contents projected demand for products we sell could result in lost sales or lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
our innovation and strategy efforts may fail to produce new businesses and may not result in any meaningful differentiation against our competitors  which could adversely affect our ability to achieve profitable growth 
we have instituted an innovation process to define and test strategic initiatives to grow business in key areas and to identify future areas of growth for us 
as a result of this innovation process  we are making large investments in training  information systems and store formats that could prove to be unsustainable or unprofitable when rolled out on a national scale 
this could negatively impact our expense structure and profitability 
our failure to successfully implement our strategic vision or the occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse impact on our business inability to provide a superior customer experience in our stores that is differentiated from our competitors failure to leverage our assets to create new revenue streams and profit failure to identify customer needs and desires and to tailor our shopping experience in a way that meets these needs inability to grow revenue through in home sales and service offerings lack of core competencies  talent and systems needed to sustain growth and support innovation efforts we rely on foreign sources for a significant portion of our merchandise  so disruptions in countries where our goods are produced or international trade or transportation issues could adversely affect availability of key products and result in associated declines in revenues 
we depend on products produced outside the united states and canada 
we could be adversely affected by a number of risks associated with production and delivery of those products into our market areas  including economic or political instability  natural disasters or public health emergencies in countries where our suppliers are located  increases in shipping costs  transportation delays or interruptions  particularly as they may affect seasonal periods  and changes in laws or taxation policies as they may affect the import and export of goods

item legal proceedings 
on march   circuit city announced a public tender offer to purchase the stock of intertan  inc circuit city completed the acquisition and intertan became a wholly owned subsidiary of circuit city on may  intertan has operated retail consumer electronics outlets under the radioshack name in canada under a licensing agreement with a subsidiary of radioshack corporation 
intertan also has operated under two other agreements with radioshack and its subsidiaries radioshack a merchandising agreement and an advertising agreement 
after the march  announcement  radioshack asserted early termination of all three agreements 
radioshack asserts that intertan failed to pay an annual fee in material breach of the advertising agreement and  alternatively  that a without cause termination of the advertising agreement triggers termination of the other agreements 
on april   radioshack filed suit against intertan in tarrant county  texas  and amended that suit on april   and february  the radioshack litigation 
intertan disputes the various termination scenarios alleged by radioshack and is vigorously defending against those claims 
the parties argued a radioshack motion for partial summary judgment on february  on march   the court issued an order on that motion stating that the three agreements were terminated no later than december  under the ruling  intertan s rights under the agreements expired june  circuit city continues to believe that radioshack is not entitled to early termination of the agreements  that intertan has substantial defenses to the radioshack claims and that radioshack has breached the agreements by seeking early termination 
there are several motions currently pending with the court  including a motion to reconsider prior rulings 
intertan intends to continue vigorously defending the claims and exercise its rights under the agreements  as well avail itself of any and all rights to appeal 
because of the ongoing legal conflict with radioshack  circuit city has taken steps to position its canadian operations for continued success  regardless of the outcome of this litigation 
circuit city believes that the outcome of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations
