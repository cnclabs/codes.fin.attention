part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation timet or the company was originally formed in and was incorporated in delaware in timet is one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted and mill products 
the company is the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium consumption 
timet is currently the only major producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  in the united states 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications where these qualities are essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium  the number of non aerospace end use markets for titanium has expanded substantially 
today  numerous industrial uses for titanium exist  including chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with such diverse uses as offshore oil and gas production installations  automotive  geothermal facilities and architectural applications 
timet s products include titanium sponge  melted products  mill products and industrial fabrications 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like timet  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
the company s long term strategy is to maximize the value of its core aerospace business while also developing new markets  applications and products to help reduce its historical dependence on the commercial aerospace industry 
in the near term  the company continues to focus on maintaining a lean cost structure  managing its raw material requirements  improving the quality of its products and processes and taking other actions to maximize its cash flow and profitability 
industry 
the company develops certain industry estimates based on its extensive experience within the titanium industry as well as information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
the company estimates that it accounted for approximately and of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products in and  respectively  and approximately and of worldwide titanium sponge production in and  respectively 
the following table illustrates the company s estimates of aggregate titanium industry mill product shipments during and year ended december  change metric tons mill product shipments to commercial aerospace sector   military sector   industrial sector   emerging markets sector   aggregate mill product shipments to all sectors   the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the commercial aerospace sector 
demand for titanium products within the commercial aerospace sector is derived from both jet engine components eg  blades  discs  rings and engine cases and airframe components eg  bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers such as timet 
the company s business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry  as approximately of the company s mill product shipment volume in was to the commercial aerospace sector  whereas  as indicated by the above table  approximately of the overall titanium industry s shipment volume in was to the commercial aerospace sector 
the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in the performance of most titanium companies 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in   and prior to  demand for titanium reached its highest level in when industry mill product shipments reached approximately  metric tons 
however  since  industry mill product shipments have fluctuated significantly  primarily due to a continued change in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector 
the company estimates that industry shipments approximated  metric tons in and  metric tons in the company currently expects total industry mill product shipments to increase by only to as compared to  due to tightness of raw material supply 
the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  traditionally issues forecasts for commercial aircraft deliveries each january and july 
according to the airline monitor  large commercial aircraft deliveries for the to period peaked in with aircraft  including wide body aircraft that use substantially more titanium than their narrow body counterparts 
large commercial aircraft deliveries totaled including wide bodies in the following table summarizes the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january for large commercial aircraft deliveries over the next five years increase decrease forecasted deliveries over previous year year total wide bodies total wide bodies the latest forecast from the airline monitor reflects a significant increase from earlier such forecasts  in large part due to record levels of new orders placed for boeing and airbus models during total order bookings for boeing and airbus in were  planes 
expectations are that new orders in will be significantly lower than  however  the strong bookings in have increased the order backlog for both boeing and airbus in support of this increased forecast 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  although this varies considerably by titanium product 
this correlates to the company s cycle  which historically precedes the cycle of the aircraft industry and related deliveries 
although persistently high oil prices have had an adverse impact on the commercial airline industry  global commercial airline traffic increased in compared to the company estimates that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will increase to  as compared to wide body planes tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than narrow body planes 
newer models of planes tend to use a higher percentage of titanium than older models 
newer wide body models such as the airbus a and the boeing dreamliner are expected to use an even greater quantity of titanium than previous wide body models 
see further discussion of titanium usage for these new planes in business markets and customer base 
titanium shipments into the military sector are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s after the end of the cold war 
in recent years  titanium has become an accepted use in ground combat vehicles as well as in naval applications 
the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to continue to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities and global conflicts 
several of today s active us military programs  including the c  f a  f and f are expected to continue in production through the end of the current decade 
however  a recent quadrennial defense review qdr recommends that the us air force stop procurement of the c with the planes it now has on order  but this recommendation still must go through the federal budget process 
without further orders  the c production line will close in in addition to the established c  f a and f programs  new us programs offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f a raptor was given full rate production approval in april according to the teal group  a leading independent aerospace publication  the us air force would like to purchase aircraft  but the department of defense is now planning for only however  additional f a raptors may be manufactured for sale to foreign nations 
in october  lockheed martin corporation was awarded the contract for construction of the f joint strike fighter jsf 
the jsf is expected to enter low rate initial production in late  with delivery of the first production aircraft in although no specific delivery patterns have been established  procurement is expected to extend over the next to years and to include as many as  to  planes  including sales to foreign nations 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
production levels for the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage are all forecasted to remain steady through the end of the decade 
utilization of titanium on military ground combat vehicles for armor applique and integrated armor or structural components continues to gain acceptance within the military market segment 
titanium armor components provide the necessary ballistic performance while achieving a mission critical vehicle performance objective of reduced weight 
in order to counteract increased threat levels  titanium is being utilized on vehicle upgrade programs in addition to new builds 
based on active programs  as well as programs currently under evaluation  the company believes there will be additional usage of titanium on ground combat vehicles that will provide continued growth in the military market sector 
in armor and armament  the company sells plate and sheet products for fabrication into applique plate for protection application of the entire ground combat vehicle as well as the primary vehicle structure 
since titanium s initial applications  the number of end use markets for titanium has significantly expanded 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
rapid growth of the chinese and other southeast asian economies has brought unprecedented demand for titanium intensive industrial equipment 
in november  the company entered into a joint venture with xi an baotimet valinox tubes co 
ltd 
baotimet to produce welded titanium tubing in the peoples republic of china 
baotimet s production facilities will be located in xi an  china  and production is expected to begin in early titanium continues to gain acceptance in many emerging market applications  including automotive  energy including oil and gas and architecture 
although titanium is generally higher cost than other competing metals  in many cases customers find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  longevity  design alternatives  life cycle value and other factors 
the company continues to explore opportunities in these emerging market applications through marketing initiatives  research and development and proprietary alloys designed to provide more cost effective alternatives for these markets 
although the company estimates that emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  the company believes emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at double digit rates over the next several years 
the company continues to actively pursue these markets and was able to grow its mill product shipments into emerging markets by more than during as compared to beginning in  the company no longer includes armor and armament related sales as part of its emerging markets sector  as titanium usage has become widely accepted for such applications 
accordingly  all such sales are now included in the company s military sector and all prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
the automotive market continues to be an attractive emerging market due to its potential for sustainable long term growth 
timet automotive is focused on developing and marketing proprietary alloys and processes specifically suited for automotive applications 
titanium is now used in several consumer car applications as well as in numerous motorcycles 
at the present time  titanium is primarily used for exhaust systems  suspension springs  engine valves  connecting rods and turbocharger compressor wheels in consumer and commercial vehicles 
in exhaust systems  titanium provides for significant weight savings  while its corrosion resistance provides life of vehicle durability 
in suspension spring applications  titanium s low modulus of elasticity allows the spring s height to be reduced by to compared to a steel spring  which  when combined with the titanium s low density  permits to weight savings over steel spring suspension systems 
titanium engine components provide mass reduction benefits that directly improve vehicle performance and fuel economy 
the application of titanium to turbocharger compressor wheels is part of a solution to meet us and european union government regulated diesel engine emissions requirements 
timetal proprietary alloys provide cost effective optimized performance for the various target applications 
the decision to select titanium components for consumer car  truck and motorcycle components remains highly cost sensitive  however  the company believes titanium s acceptance in consumer vehicles will expand as the automotive industry continues to better understand the benefits titanium offers 
the oil and gas market utilizes titanium for down hole logging tools  critical riser components  fire water systems and saltwater cooling systems 
additionally  as offshore development of new oil and gas fields moves into the ultra deep water depths  market demand for titanium s light weight  high strength and corrosion resistance properties is creating new opportunities for the material 
the company has a group dedicated to developing the expansion of titanium use in this market and in other non aerospace applications 
products and operations 
the company is a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in titanium products  ii melted products ingot  electrodes and slab  the result of melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various alloys  iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe  and iv fabrications spools  pipefittings  manifolds  vessels  etc 
that are cut  formed  welded and assembled from titanium mill products during the past three years  all of timet s net sales were generated by the company s integrated titanium operations its titanium melted and mill products segment  its only business segment 
business and geographic financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge so called because of its appearance is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal 
the first step in timet s sponge production involves the combination of titanium containing rutile ores derived from beach sand with chlorine and petroleum coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
the company s titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada incorporates vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in the chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the mass is mechanically pushed out of the distillation vessel  sheared and crushed  while the residual magnesium chloride is electrolytically separated and recycled 
titanium ingot is a cylindrical solid shape that  in timet s case  weighs up to metric tons 
titanium slab is a rectangular solid shape that  in timet s case  weighs up to metric tons 
each ingot or slab is formed by melting titanium sponge  scrap or both  usually with various other alloys such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium 
the melting process for ingot and slab is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  timet uses its ingot and slab as the starting material for further processing into mill products 
however  it also sells ingot  electrodes and slab to third parties 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling  milling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
the company sends certain products either to the company s service centers or to outside vendors for further processing before being shipped to customers 
the company s customers either process the company s products for their ultimate end use or for sale to third parties 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  the company performs extensive testing on its products 
the inspection process is critical to ensuring that the company s products meet the high quality requirements of its customers  particularly in aerospace component production 
the company certifies that its products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
the company currently is reliant on several outside processors one of which is owned by a competitor to perform certain rolling  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting and forging steps in france 
in france  the processor is also a joint venture partner in the company s owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa timet savoie 
during the past several years  the company has made significant strides toward reducing the reliance on competitor owned sources for these services  so that any interruption in these functions should not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
distribution 
the company sells its products through its own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
the company s distribution system also includes eight company owned service centers five in the us and three in europe  which sell the company s products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products  including bar  sheet  plate  tubing and strip 
the company believes its service centers provide a competitive advantage because of their ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium ingot  slab and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloys 
the following table summarizes the company s raw material usage requirements in the production of its melted and mill products percentage of total raw material requirements internally produced sponge purchased sponge titanium scrap alloys the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa and sri lanka 
the company purchases the majority of its supply of rutile ore from australia 
the company believes the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and does not anticipate any interruptions of its rutile supplies 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience interruptions 
chlorine is currently obtained from a single supplier near the company s sponge plant in henderson  nevada 
while the company does not presently anticipate any chlorine supply problems  there can be no assurances the chlorine supply will not be interrupted 
in the event of supply disruption  the company has taken steps to mitigate this risk  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable it to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow the company to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
during  the company was the only major us producer of titanium sponge and one of only six major worldwide producers the others are located in russia  kazakhstan  the ukraine and two in japan 
additionally  there are two smaller sponge producers located in china 
however  the company cannot supply all of its needs for all grades of titanium sponge internally and is dependent  therefore  on third parties for a substantial portion of its sponge requirements 
titanium melted and mill products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
presently  timet and certain companies in japan are the only producers of premium quality sponge that currently have complete approval for all significant demanding aerospace applications 
over the past few years  sponge producers in russia and kazakhstan have progressed in their efforts to obtain approval for the use of their sponge into all aerospace applications 
this qualification process is likely to continue for several more years 
historically  the company has purchased sponge predominantly from producers in kazakhstan and japan 
in september  the company entered into a sponge supply agreement  effective from january  through december   which requires minimum annual purchases by the company 
the company has no other long term sponge supply agreements 
since  the company has also purchased sponge from the us defense logistics agency dla stockpile  however  the dla stockpile became fully depleted during the company expects to continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources during the company utilizes titanium scrap at its melting locations that is either generated internally  purchased from certain of its customers under various buyback arrangements or purchased externally on the open market 
such scrap consists of alloyed and commercially pure solids and turnings 
internally produced scrap is generated in the company s factories during both melting and mill product processing 
scrap obtained through customer buyback arrangements provides a closed loop arrangement resulting in greater supply and cost stability 
externally purchased scrap comes from a wide range of sources  including customers  collectors  processors and brokers 
the company anticipates that to of the scrap it will utilize during will be purchased from external suppliers  as compared to to for  due to the company s successful efforts to increase its closed loop arrangements 
the company also occasionally sells scrap  usually in a form or grade it cannot economically recycle 
market forces can significantly impact the supply or cost of externally produced scrap 
the amount of scrap generated in the supply chain varies during the titanium business cycles 
during the middle of the cycle  scrap generation and consumption are in relative equilibrium  minimizing disruptions in supply or significant changes in the available supply and market prices for scrap 
increasing or decreasing cycles tend to cause significant changes in both the supply and market price of scrap 
early in the titanium cycle  when the demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to increase  the company s requirements and those of other titanium manufacturers precede the increase in scrap generation by downstream customers and the supply chain  placing upward pressure on the market price of scrap 
the opposite situation occurs when demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to decline  resulting in greater availability of supply and placing downward pressure on the market price of scrap 
as a net purchaser of scrap  the company is susceptible to price increases during periods of increasing demand 
this phenomenon normally results in higher selling prices for melted and mill products  which tends to offset the increased material costs 
all of the company s major competitors utilize scrap as a raw material in their melt operations 
in addition to use by titanium manufacturers  titanium scrap is used in steel making operations during production of interstitial free steels  stainless steels and high strength low alloy steels 
recent strong demand for these steel products  especially from china  has produced a significant increase in demand for titanium scrap at a time when titanium scrap generation rates are at low levels  partly due to lower commercial aircraft build rates over the past few years 
these events created a significantly tightened supply of titanium scrap during and  and the company expects this trend to continue during for timet  this will translate to lower availability and higher cost for externally purchased scrap in the near term 
in the company was somewhat limited in its ability to raise prices for the portion of its business that is subject to long term pricing agreements 
the company s ability to offset these increased material costs with higher selling prices should improve in  as many of the company s long term agreements ltas have either expired or have been renegotiated for with price adjustments that take into account raw material cost fluctuations 
additionally  the expected increase in commercial aircraft build rates over the next several years  as previously discussed  could have the effect of lessening the shortage of titanium scrap 
further  several titanium producers  including timet  have recently announced plans to expand their respective sponge producing capabilities 
although these expansions should help reduce the current imbalance of global supply and demand for raw materials  the company does not believe the raw material shortage will be fully relieved at any time in the near future and therefore expects relatively high prices for raw materials to continue for at least the near term 
various alloys used in the production of titanium products are also available from a number of suppliers 
however  the recent high level of global demand for steel products has also resulted in a significant increase in the costs for several alloys  such as vanadium and molybdenum 
the cost of these alloys during was significantly higher than at any point during the past years 
vanadium and molybdenum costs peaked in the spring of and finished the year well below those levels 
although availability is not expected to be a concern and the company has negotiated certain price and cost protection with suppliers and customers  there is no assurance that such alloy costs will not continue to fluctuate significantly in the near future 
customer agreements 
the company has ltas with certain major customers  including  among others  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc and its german and us affiliates rolls royce  united technologies corporation utc  pratt whitney and related companies  societe nationale detude et de construction de moteurs d aviation snecma  wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc and valtimet sas valtimet 
these agreements expire at various times from through  are subject to certain conditions and generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments  ii formula determined prices although some contain elements based on market pricing and iii price adjustments for certain raw material and energy cost fluctuations 
generally  the ltas require the company s service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
certain provisions of these ltas have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
during  of the company s sales revenues were from customers under ltas 
in certain events of nonperformance by the company or the customer  the ltas may be terminated early 
although it is possible that some portion of the business would continue on a non lta basis  the termination of one or more of the ltas could result in a material effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the ltas were designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer  while providing timet with a committed base of volume throughout the aerospace business cycles 
during the third quarter of  the company and wyman gordon agreed to terminate the purchase and sale agreement associated with the formation of the titanium castings joint venture previously owned by the two parties 
the company paid wyman gordon a total of million in three quarterly installments in connection with this termination  which included the termination of certain favorable purchase terms 
the company recorded a one time charge for the entire million as a reduction to sales in the third quarter of concurrently  the company entered into new long term purchase and sale agreements with wyman gordon that expire in prior to july   under the terms of the previous lta between timet and boeing  in through  boeing would have been required to advance timet million annually less per pound of titanium product purchased by boeing subcontractors under the boeing lta during the preceding year 
effectively  the company collected less from boeing than the lta selling price for each pound of titanium product sold directly to boeing and reduced the related customer advance recorded by the company 
for titanium products sold to boeing subcontractors  the company collected the full lta selling price  but gave boeing credit by reducing the next year s annual advance by per pound 
the boeing customer advance was also reduced as the company recognized income under the take or pay provisions of the lta  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under a separate agreement  timet must establish and hold buffer inventory for boeing at timet s facilities  for which boeing will be invoiced by timet at lta pricing when such material is processed into a mill product by timet 
effective july   the company entered into a new lta with boeing 
the new lta expires on december  and provides for  among other things  i mutual annual purchase and supply commitments by both parties  ii continuation of the existing buffer inventory program currently in place for boeing and iii certain improved product pricing  including certain adjustments for raw material cost fluctuations 
beginning in  the new lta also replaces the take or pay provisions of the previous lta with an annual makeup payment early in the following year in the event boeing purchases less than its annual volume commitment in any year 
see item md a for additional information regarding the boeing lta 
the company s lta with valtimet  a manufacturer of welded stainless steel and titanium tubing that is principally sold into the industrial markets  was entered into in and expires in valtimet is a owned affiliate of timet 
under the valtimet lta  timet has agreed to provide a certain percentage of valtimet s titanium requirements at formula determined selling prices  subject to certain conditions 
certain provisions of this contract have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
markets and customer base 
the following table summarizes the company s sales revenue by geographical location year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to customers within north america europe other further information regarding the company s external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets can be found in the company s consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the company s sales and operating income are derived from operations based in the us  the us  france and italy 
as shown in the below table  the company generates more than half of its sales revenue from sales to the commercial aerospace sector 
as previously noted  the company has ltas with certain major aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  utc  snecma and wyman gordon 
this concentration of customers may impact the company s overall exposure to credit and other risks  either positively or negatively  in that all of these customers may be similarly affected by the same economic or other conditions 
the following table provides supplemental sales revenue information regarding the company s dependence on the commercial aerospace sector and certain customer relationships year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to commercial aerospace sector customers under ltas significant customers under ltas rolls royce and other rolls royce suppliers ten largest customers significant customers pcc and related entities greater than of net sales 
includes direct sales to certain of the pcc related entities under the terms of the rolls royce ltas 
the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace sector consists of two major manufacturers of large over seats commercial airframes boeing commercial airplanes group a unit of boeing and airbus owned by european aeronautic defence and space company and owned by bae systems 
in addition to the airframe manufacturers  the following four manufacturers of large civil aircraft engines are also significant titanium users rolls royce  general electric aircraft engines  pratt whitney and snecma 
the company s sales are made both directly to these major manufacturers and to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use the company s titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on the company s business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
the backlogs for boeing and airbus reflect orders for aircraft to be delivered over several years 
changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
the following table shows the estimated firm order backlogs for boeing and airbus  as reported by the airline monitor in january at december  firm order backlog all planes airbus    boeing    firm order backlog wide body planes airbus boeing wide body planes as of total firm order backlog wide body planes eg  boeing  and and airbus a  a  and a tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than narrow body planes eg  boeing and and airbus a  a and a 
newer models of planes tend to use a higher percentage of titanium than older models 
additionally  boeing generally uses a higher percentage of titanium in its airframes than airbus 
for example  the company estimates that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each boeing  and  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
the company estimates that approximately metric tons  metric tons and metric tons of titanium are purchased for the manufacture of each airbus a  a and a  respectively  including both the airframes and engines 
at year end  a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a  a program officially launched in with anticipated first deliveries in current estimates are that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each a manufactured 
additionally  at year end  a total of firm orders have been placed for the boeing  a program officially launched in april with anticipated first deliveries in although the will contain more composite materials than a typical boeing airplane  the company estimates that approximately metric tons of titanium metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each manufactured 
the company believes significant additional titanium will be required in the early years of manufacturing until the program reaches maturity 
during  airbus officially launched the a program  which is a major derivative of the airbus a with first deliveries scheduled for as of december   firm booked orders received by airbus for the a totaled airplanes 
these as will use composite materials and new engines similar to the ones used on the boeing and are expected to require significantly more titanium as compared with earlier airbus models 
the company s preliminary estimates are that approximately metric tons metric tons for the airframe and metric tons for the engines will be purchased for each a manufactured 
however  the final titanium buy weight may change as the a is still in the design phase 
outside of commercial aerospace and military sectors  the company manufactures a wide range of products for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  automotive and power generation 
approximately of the company s sales revenue in and and in was generated by sales into industrial and emerging markets  including sales to valtimet for the production of welded tubing 
for the oil and gas industry  the company provides seamless pipe for downhole casing  risers  tapered stress joints and other offshore oil and gas production equipment  along with firewater piping systems 
in addition to melted and mill products  which are sold into the commercial aerospace  military  industrial and emerging markets sectors  the company sells certain other products such as titanium fabrications  titanium scrap and titanium tetrachloride 
sales of these other products represented of the company s sales revenue in and in each of and the company s backlog of unfilled orders was approximately million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  over of the year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during the company s order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
the company has explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
the company will also continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
in addition  producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified without substantial capital expenditures to process titanium products 
there are currently six major  and several minor  producers of titanium sponge in the world 
four of the major producers have announced plans to increase sponge production capacity 
timet is currently the only major us sponge producer 
the company believes that entry as a new producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment and substantial technical expertise 
the company s principal competitors in the aerospace titanium market are allegheny technologies incorporated ati and rti international metals  inc rti  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
uniti a joint venture between ati and vsmpo  rti and certain japanese producers are the company s principal competitors in the industrial and emerging markets 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent the company is able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing sponge from such countries for use in its own operations  the negative effect of these imports on the company can be somewhat mitigated 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
because a significant portion of end use products made from titanium products are ultimately exported  the company  along with its principal competitors and many customers  actively utilize the duty drawback mechanism to recover most of the tariff paid on imports 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future 
the japanese government has raised the elimination or harmonization of tariffs on titanium products  including titanium sponge  for consideration in multi lateral trade negotiations through the world trade organization the so called doha round 
as part of the doha round  the united states has proposed the staged elimination of all industrial tariffs  including those on titanium 
the japanese government has specifically asked that titanium in all it forms be included in the tariff elimination program 
the company has urged that no change be made to these tariffs  either on wrought or unwrought products 
the negotiations are currently scheduled to conclude at the end of for implementation beginning in timet has successfully resisted  and will continue to resist  efforts to eliminate duties on sponge and unwrought titanium products  although no assurances can be made that the company will continue to be successful in these activities 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge  ingot and mill products and thus the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
research and development 
the company s research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of timet s products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development for automotive and other emerging markets 
the company conducts the majority of its research and development activities at its henderson technical laboratory in henderson  nevada  with additional activities at its witton  england facility 
the company incurred research and development costs of million in  million in and million in in april  the company was selected by the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa to explore low cost titanium extraction processes 
since  the main effort has focused on the ffc cambridge process 
as of december   work to develop and scale up that process at timet has been discontinued due to low overall process efficiency 
timet continues to work in partnership with darpa and others to meet the goals of the darpa titanium initiative 
the work with darpa complements timet s own programs exploring new technologies and improvements to the existing vacuum distilled sponge process 
patents and trademarks 
the company holds us and us patents applicable to certain of its titanium alloys and manufacturing technology  which expire at various times from through the company continually seeks patent protection with respect to its technical base and has occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
the company believes the trademarks timet r and timetal r  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are important to its business 
the company believes that proprietary alloys targeting automotive exhaust  turbocharger  engine valve  and suspension spring applications provide the company competitive advantages in the automotive market 
further  the company was recently granted patent protection for an improved machinability alloy  timetal m  for use in forged and machined components applicable to both aerospace and non aerospace market sectors 
additionally  the company has been granted certain patents and has certain other patent applications pending relating to various aspects of its manufacturing technology 
however  the majority of the company s titanium alloys and manufacturing technologies do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
employees 
the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and its impact on the company s business is the principal reason for significant changes in the company s employment 
the increases during and reflect the increase in demand for titanium products during those periods 
the company currently expects employment to increase throughout as production continues to increase and its sponge plant expansion project in henderson  nevada nears completion 
the following table shows the number of employees at the end of the past years employees at december  us    europe the company s production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio  and its production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada approximately of the company s total us employees are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in july and january  respectively 
employees at the company s other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
approximately of the salaried and hourly employees at the company s european facilities are represented by various european labor unions 
the company recently extended its labor agreement with its uk production and maintenance employees through  and the company s labor agreements with its french and italian employees are renewed annually 
the company currently considers its employee relations to be satisfactory 
however  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
regulatory and environmental matters 
the company s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the occupational  safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
the company uses and manufactures substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
the company has used and manufactured such substances throughout the history of its operations 
although the company has substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of environmental  health and safety issues  the company could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
there can be no assurance that some  or all  of the risks discussed under this heading will not result in liabilities that would be material to the company s business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the company believes that its operations are in compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws 
the company s policy is to continually strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
the company incurred capital expenditures related to health  safety and environmental compliance and improvement of approximately million in  million in and million in such capital expenditures include million in and million in related to the construction of a water conservation facility at the company s henderson  nevada location 
the company s capital budget provides for approximately million for environmental  health and safety capital expenditures during from time to time  the company may be subject to health  safety or environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties 
however  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters

item a risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with our business 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor that could result in reduced earnings  liquidity or operating losses  could in turn adversely affect our ability to meet our liabilities or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
the cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate causes such customers demand for our products to be cyclical  creating uncertainty regarding our future profitability 
the titanium industry in general  and timet specifically  has historically derived a substantial portion of its business from the commercial aerospace sector 
consequently  the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in our performance 
over the past years  the titanium industry had cyclical peaks in mill product shipments in  and and cyclical lows in   and prior to  demand for titanium reached its highest level in  when industry mill product shipments reached approximately  metric tons 
however  since that peak  industry mill product shipments have fluctuated significantly  primarily due to a continued change in demand for titanium from the commercial aerospace sector  but also due to geopolitical instability and the economic impact of terrorist threats and attacks 
sales of our products to the commercial aerospace sector accounted for of our total sales revenue in each of the last three years 
events that could adversely affect the commercial aerospace sector  such as future terrorist attacks  world health crises or reduced orders from commercial airlines resulting from continued operating losses at the airlines  could significantly decrease our results of operations  and our business and financial condition could significantly decline 
adverse changes to  or interruptions in  our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers could reduce our revenues 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from sales to the commercial aerospace sector 
sales under ltas with certain customers in the commercial aerospace sector account for a significant percentage of our annual sales revenue 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  snecma  utc and wyman gordon  under the ltas we have with these customers  our sales could decrease substantially 
our failure to develop new markets would result in our continued dependence on the cyclical commercial aerospace sector  and our operating results would  accordingly  remain cyclical 
in an effort to reduce dependence on the commercial aerospace market and to increase participation in other markets  we have been devoting resources to developing new markets and applications for our products  principally in automotive  oil and gas and other emerging markets for titanium 
developing these emerging market applications involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to the fact that titanium must compete with less expensive alternative materials in these potential markets or applications 
we may not be successful in developing new markets or applications for our products  significant time may be required for such development and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
our dependence upon certain critical raw materials that are subject to price and availability fluctuations could lead to increased costs or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers around the world  and principally on those located in australia  for our supply of titanium containing rutile ore  one of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge 
while chlorine  another of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge  is generally widely available  we currently obtain our chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson  nevada 
also  we cannot supply all our needs for all grades of titanium sponge and scrap internally and are therefore dependent on third parties for a substantial portion of our raw material requirements 
all of our major competitors utilize sponge and scrap as raw materials in their melt operations 
in addition to use by titanium manufacturers  titanium scrap is used in certain steel making operations 
current demand for these steel products  especially from china  have produced a significant increase in demand for titanium scrap at a time when titanium scrap generation rates are at low levels because of the lower commercial aircraft build rates in recent years 
purchase prices and availability of these critical materials are subject to volatility 
at any given time  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical materials on a timely basis  on price and other terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we have experienced operating and net losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future 
we have incurred operating losses during each of   and and incurred net losses in each year from through our ability to achieve profitability in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including the following o market demand and prices for titanium products  particularly demand and pricing in the commercial aerospace sector  o our ability to increase prices for titanium products to a level that exceeds any increases in materials or production costs  o the avoidance of any material adverse developments either in the capacity utilization for the production of titanium sponge or the availability of titanium scrap  and o favorable general economic conditions throughout the world 
reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all tariffs on imported titanium products into the united states could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could decrease pricing for our products 
in the us titanium market  the increasing presence of non us participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future  and we may not be successful in resisting efforts to eliminate duties or tariffs on titanium products 
see discussion of doha round in business competition 
we may be unable to reach or maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements with unions representing a significant portion of our employees 
our production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio  and our production and maintenance workers in henderson  nevada  are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in july and january  for the respective locations 
approximately of the salaried and hourly employees at our european facilities are represented by various european labor unions 
our labor agreement with our uk employees expires in  and the agreements with our french and italian employees are renewed annually 
a labor dispute or work stoppage could materially decrease our operating results 
we may not succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions to replace expiring agreements or to maintain satisfactory relations under existing collective bargaining agreements 
if our employees were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
because we are subject to environmental and worker safety laws and regulations  we may be required to remediate the environmental effects of our operations or take steps to modify our operations to comply with these laws and regulations  which could reduce our profitability 
various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations govern our operations 
throughout the history of our operations  we have used and manufactured  and currently use and manufacture  substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
although we have substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of environmental  health and safety issues  we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
some or all of these risks may result in liabilities that could reduce our profitability 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
the global markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down prices for our products because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the industries in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
in addition  producers of metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities 
such facilities could be used or modified without substantial expenditures to process titanium mill products  which could lead to increased competition and decreased pricing for our titanium products 
in addition  many factors  including the historical presence of excess capacity in the titanium industry  work to intensify the price competition for available business at low points in the business cycle

income taxes 
the company operates in several tax jurisdictions and is subject to varying income tax rates 
as a result  the geographic mix of pretax income or loss can impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
for the years ended december   and  the company s income tax rate varied from the us statutory rate primarily due to changes in the deferred income tax valuation allowance related to the company s tax attributes with respect to the more likely than not recognition criteria during those periods 
the company periodically reviews its deferred income tax assets to determine if future realization is more likely than not 
during the first quarter of  based on the company s recent history of us income  its near term outlook and the effect of its change in method of inventory determination from the lifo cost method to the specific identification cost method for us federal income tax purposes see note  the company changed its estimate of its ability to utilize the tax benefits of its us net operating loss nol carryforwards  alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards and other net deductible temporary differences other than the majority of the company s capital loss carryforwards 
consequently  the company determined that its net deferred income tax asset related to such us tax attributes and other net deductible temporary differences now meet the more likely than not recognition criteria 
accordingly  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance attributable to such us deferred income tax asset during million in the fourth quarter 
during the first quarter of  based on the company s recent history of uk income  its near term outlook and its historic uk profitability  the company also changed its estimate of its ability to utilize its net deductible temporary differences and other tax attributes related to the uk  primarily comprised of i the future benefits associated with the reversal of its uk minimum pension liability deferred income tax asset and ii the benefits of its uk nol carryforward 
consequently  the company determined that its net deferred income tax asset in the uk now meets the more likely than not recognition criteria 
accordingly  the company reversed million of the valuation allowance attributable to such deferred income tax asset during million in the fourth quarter 
during  due to a change in estimate of the company s ability to utilize the benefits of its nol carryforwards in germany  the company determined that its deferred income tax asset in germany met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
accordingly  the company reversed the million valuation allowance attributable to such deferred income tax asset 
in addition  the company s deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to income from continuing operations decreased by million during  primarily due to the utilization of the us and us nol carryforwards  the benefit of which had previously not met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
during the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a deferred income tax benefit related to a million and million  respectively  decrease in the company s us deferred income tax asset valuation allowance attributable to the company s recognition  for us income tax purposes only  of a capital gain on the fourth quarter sale of certain property located at the company s henderson  nevada facility see note 
the company recognized a corresponding deferred income tax expense in  when the gain was recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company utilized a portion of its us capital loss carryforward to offset the income taxes generated from the sale of such property 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted into law 
the new law provides for a special deduction for certain dividends received from controlled foreign corporations in in the second quarter of  the company completed its evaluation of this new provision and determined that it would benefit from the special dividend received deduction  but the company did not distribute dividends under the act until the third quarter of in the third quarter of  the company executed a reinvestment plan and distributed million of earnings from its european subsidiaries  which qualified for the special dividend received deduction and  in accordance with the requirements of fasb staff position no 
 recognized the million income tax related to such repatriation 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that an additional million of repatriations would qualify for the special dividend received deduction  and the company recognized an additional million income tax related to the fourth quarter repatriation 
the company has not provided for us deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on basis differences in its non us consolidated subsidiaries that result primarily from undistributed earnings the company intends to reinvest indefinitely 
the new law also provides for a special deduction from us taxable income equal to a specified percentage of a us company s qualified income from domestic manufacturing activities as defined 
the company believes that the majority of its operations meet the definition of qualified domestic manufacturing activities 
however  the company did not derive any benefit from the special manufacturing deduction in  because the company s existing us nol carryforwards fully offset its us taxable income 
in june  the state of ohio enacted a new tax law  which phases out ohio s existing income tax system over the next five years and replaces it with a tax based on gross receipts 
in the second quarter of  as a result of this phase out  the company reduced its deferred income tax asset related primarily to its ohio nol carryforwards by million 
in the fourth quarter of  due primarily to updated income forecasts and revised timing information on the recognition of certain temporary differences  the company increased its deferred income tax asset related primarily to its ohio nol carryforwards by million 
the net impact of these adjustments for was a decrease of million 
the provision for income taxes in includes million of deferred income taxes resulting from the elimination of the company s minimum pension liability equity adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to the company s us defined benefit pension plan 
in accordance with gaap  the company did not recognize a deferred income tax benefit related to a portion of the minimum pension equity adjustment previously recognized  as the company had also recognized a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to its us net operating loss carryforward and other us net deductible temporary differences during a portion of the periods in which the minimum pension equity adjustment had previously been recognized 
a portion of such valuation allowance recognized million was recognized through the pension liability component of other comprehensive income 
as discussed  during the company concluded recognition of such deferred income tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required  and the reversal of all of such valuation allowance was recognized through the provision for income taxes included in the determination of net income  including the million portion of the valuation allowance which was previously recognized through other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company was no longer required to recognize a minimum pension liability related to its us plan  and the company reversed the minimum pension liability previously recognized in other comprehensive income 
after the reversal of such minimum pension liability  which was recognized on a net of tax basis  the million amount remained in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the us minimum pension liability  which is required to be recognized in the provision for income taxes during the period in which the minimum pension liability is no longer required to be recognized

in  timet achieved all time record levels for net sales  operating income and net income 
these levels were largely driven by increased demand in the commercial aerospace sector that  when coupled with the relatively short supply of raw materials  resulted in average selling prices for both melted and mill products reaching their highest historical levels at and per kilogram  respectively 
the company expects that the current up cycle will continue beyond the company continues to see the availability of certain raw materials tighten  and  consequently  the prices for such raw materials increase 
the company currently expects that the shortage in certain raw materials is likely to continue throughout  which could limit the company s ability to produce enough titanium products to fully meet customer demand 
in addition  timet has certain long term customer agreements that will somewhat limit the company s ability to pass on all of its increased raw material costs 
however  the company expects that the impact of higher average selling prices for melted and mill products in will more than offset such increased raw materials costs 
as compared to  the company currently expects its net sales revenue to increase by to to between billion and billion 
mill product sales volume  which was  metric tons in  is expected to range from  and  metric tons in  an increase of to 
melted product sales volume  which was  metric tons in  is expected to remain relatively unchanged in melted product average selling prices are expected to increase by to and mill product average selling prices are expected increase by to  as compared to the company s cost of sales is affected by a number of factors including customer and product mix  material yields  plant operating rates  raw material costs  labor costs and energy costs 
raw material costs  which include sponge  scrap and alloys  represent the largest portion of the company s manufacturing cost structure  and  as previously discussed  continued cost increases are expected during scrap and certain alloy prices have continued their upward rise  and increased energy costs also continue to have a negative impact on gross margin 
the company currently expects production volumes to continue to increase in  with overall capacity utilization expected to approximate in as compared to in 
however  practical capacity utilization measures can vary significantly based on product mix 
selling  general  administrative and development expenses are expected to increase slightly but decrease as a percentage of sales 
under the terms of the new boeing lta  as previously discussed  the company does not currently expect boeing to incur a makeup payment for as boeing is expected to purchase at least the minimum specified volumes from the company 
the company expects its operating income to increase to over  to between million and million 
capital expenditures during are expected to range from million to million 
the increased spending over primarily reflects million related to the expansion of the sponge plant in henderson  nevada and additional capacity improvements as the company continues to respond to the increased demand by its customers 
depreciation and amortization should approximate million in non gaap financial measures 
in an effort to provide investors with information in addition to the company s results as determined gaap  the company has provided the following non gaap financial disclosures that it believes may provide useful information to investors o the company discloses percentage changes in its mill and melted product selling prices in us dollars  which have been adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in product mix 
the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors by allowing them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in product mix  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices 
depending on the composition of changes in product mix  the percentage change in selling prices excluding the effect of changes in product mix can be higher or lower than such percentage change would be using the actual product mix prevailing during the respective periods  o in addition to disclosing percentage changes in its mill product selling prices adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in product mix  the company also discloses such percentage changes in billing currencies  which also excludes the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors by allowing them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the various actual billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar strengthens weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in selling prices in billing currencies will be higher lower than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  and o the company has disclosed operating income excluding the impact of the boeing take or pay income 
the company believes this provides investors with useful information to better analyze the company s business and possible future earnings 
effective july   the company entered into a new lta with boeing  replacing the take or pay provisions with an annual makeup payment early in the following year in the event boeing purchases less than its annual volume commitment in any year

the titanium industry historically has derived a substantial portion of its business from the aerospace industry 
the aerospace industry is cyclical  and changes in economic conditions within the aerospace industry significantly impact the company s earnings and operating cash flows 
cash flow from operations has been a primary source of the company s liquidity 
changes in titanium pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect the company s liquidity 
certain items included in the determination of net loss have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash may differ from their impact on net loss 
for example  pension expense and postretirement healthcare and life insurance opeb expense will generally differ from the outflows of cash for payment of such benefits 
in addition  relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales and purchases 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period than that in which the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the cash payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
the company s net income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  accounts receivable increased during primarily due to increased sales  as fourth quarter net sales  the primary source of the year end accounts receivable balance  increased over the year ago period

inventories decreased during primarily due to the company s concentrated focus on inventory reduction during changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities reflect  among other things  the timing of payments to suppliers of titanium sponge  titanium scrap and other raw material purchases 
accrued liabilities increased during primarily due to a million increase in the company s accrual for employee profit sharing payments to be made in accrued liabilities increased during primarily due to i a million net increase in the company s accrual for incentive compensation for potential employee profit sharing payments to be made in and ii a million increase to the company s accrual for costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation at the company s henderson  nevada facility 
these increases were partially offset by i payment of the million final installment related to termination of the prior wyman gordon agreement  ii a million reduction of the company s vacation accrual related to the company s modification of its vacation policy for its u 
s salaried employees and iii a million reclassification of the company s us defined benefit pension liability from current to noncurrent  as the company s short term cash contribution requirements decreased significantly 
pursuant to the company s previous agreement with boeing  boeing advanced timet million annually less per pound of titanium product purchased by boeing subcontractors during the preceding year

these deposits  which are restricted as to the company s use  provide the company with interest income as opposed to interest expense incurred through the use of letters of credit

defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans one each in the us  the us and france 
prior to december   the us maintained two plans  which were merged as of that date 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and us plans  as the french plan is not material to the company s consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations or statements of cash flows 
the company recorded consolidated pension expense of million in  million in and million in pension expense for these periods  the majority of which related to the uk plan  was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining pension expense and pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds to year maturities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies generally merrill lynch  moody s  solomon smith barney and ubs warburg as well as composite indices provided by the company s actuaries 
changes in the company s discount rate over the past three years reflect the decline in such bond rates during that period 
the company establishes a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense for the subsequent year 
the company used the following discount rate assumptions for its pension plans discount rates used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plan uk plan in developing the company s expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluates historical market rates of return and input from its actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
the company used the following long term rate of return assumptions for its pension plans long term rates of return used for obligation at obligation at obligation at december  december  december  and expense in and expense in and expense in us plan uk plan lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s us plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s us plan s pension expense by approximately million 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
during the second quarter of  the company transferred all of its us plan s assets into the combined master retirement trust cmrt 
the cmrt is a collective investment trust established by valhi to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by valhi and certain related companies 
a sub account of the cmrt held of timet common stock at december   however  the company s plan assets are invested only in the portion of the cmrt that does not hold timet common stock 
at december   valhi and related entities or persons excluding the cmrt held approximately of timet s outstanding common stock and approximately of the company s series a preferred stock 
harold c 
simmons  chairman of the board of directors of valhi and timet  is the sole trustee of the cmrt and a member of the trust investment committee for the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt through december   the average annual rate of return earned by the cmrt  as calculated based on the average percentage change in the cmrt s net asset value per cmrt unit for each applicable year  has been with a return for 
at december   the cmrt s asset mix based on an aggregate asset value of million was us equity securities  foreign equity securities  debt securities and cash and other 
the cmrt s trustee and investment committee actively manage the investments within the cmrt 
such parties have in the past  and may again in the future  periodically change the relative asset mix based upon  among other things  advice they receive from third party advisors and their expectation as to what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
based on the above  the company set its long term rate of return assumption at for december  and pension obligations and  and pension expense for its us plan 
because of market fluctuations and prior funding strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and fixed income securities for the uk plan 
during  the trustees for the uk plan selected a new investment advisor effective in for the uk plan and modified its asset allocation goals 
the company s future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for its uk plan is based on an asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities and all current contributions to the plan are invested wholly in fixed income securities in order to gradually effect the shift 
based on various factors  including improved economic and market conditions  gains on the plan assets during and projected asset mix  the company increased its assumed long term rate of return for december  pension obligations and for pension expense to for its uk plan and maintained the assumption for december  pension obligations and for pension expense 
because all contributions continue to be put into fixed income securities  the company expects the plan s asset mix to continue moving closer to the projected mix  which reflects a higher percentage of fixed income securities 
as such  the company decreased its assumed long term rate of return for december  pension obligations and for pension expense to for its uk plan 
although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  the company will continue to evaluate its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust it as considered necessary 
the expected return on the fair value of the plan assets  determined based on the expected long term rate of return  is a component of pension expense 
this methodology further recognizes actual investment gains or losses ie  the difference between the expected and actual returns based on the market value of assets in pension expense through amortization in future periods based upon the expected average remaining service life of the plan participants 
unrealized gains or losses may impact future periods to the extent the accumulated gains or losses are outside the corridor as defined by sfas no 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  the company estimates that its us plan will have pension income of approximately million in  approximately million in and approximately million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would increase decrease projected pension income by approximately million in each of  and a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would increase decrease projected pension income by approximately million in and million in each of and based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of pound  the company estimates that pension expense for its uk plan will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in and and by million in a increase decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease increase projected pension expense by approximately million in  million in and million in actual future pension expense will depend on actual future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in the company s pension plans 
the company made cash contributions of approximately million in and million in to the us plans and cash contributions of approximately million in  million in and million in to the uk plan 
based upon the current funded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  the company believes that it will be required to make the following cash contributions exclusive of any required employee contributions over the next five years projected cash contributions us plan usplan total in millions  and using an exchange rate of pound for uk plan year ending december  the us plan s paid benefits of approximately million in  million in and million in  and the uk plan paid benefits of approximately million in  million in and million in based upon current projections  the company believes the plans will be required to pay the following benefits over the next ten years projected retirement benefits us plan usplan total in millions  and using an exchange rate of pound for uk plan year ending december  through the value of the plans assets has increased significantly over the past three years based mainly on performance of the plans equity securities 
the us plan s assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively  and the uk plan s assets were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the combination of actual investment returns  changing discount rates and changes in other assumptions has a significant effect on the company s funded plan status plan assets compared to projected benefit obligations 
in  the effect of positive investment returns more than offset the effects of a decline in the discount rate  thereby moving the us plan into a million over funded status at december  whereas  in  the effect of positive investment returns and cash contributions was more than offset by the effect of a decline in the discount rate and certain changes in mortality and other retirement assumptions  thereby increasing in the us plan s under funded status by million to million at december  in the effect of positive investment returns in the uk plan  as well as the effect of the strengthening dollar compared to the british pound sterling  more than offset the decline in the discount rate  thereby reducing the uk plan s under funded status by million to million at december  whereas  in  the effect of positive investment returns was more than offset by the effect of a decline in the discount rate and certain changes in mortality and retirement assumptions  as well as the effect of the weakening dollar compared to the british pound sterling  thereby increasing the under funded status of the uk plan by million to million at december  based upon the change in the funded status of the plans during  the company was able to reduce its net additional minimum pension liability charge net of tax to equity by million  reflecting additional comprehensive income of million for the us plan based on elimination of the additional minimum pension liability for this plan and additional comprehensive income of million for the uk plan 
postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the company provides limited opeb benefits to a portion of its us employees upon retirement 
the company funds such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
the company paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  of million in  million in and million in the company recorded consolidated opeb expense of million in  million in and million in opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
the discount rate the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is the same as that used for the company s us pension plans 
lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased the company s opeb expense by less than million 
the company estimates the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by the company s actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  the company considers industry trends  the company s actual healthcare cost experience and the company s future benefit structure 
for  the company used a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in if the health care trend rate changed by for each year  opeb expense would have increased decreased by approximately million in for  the company is using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  the company estimates that opeb expense will approximate million in  million in and million in a increase decrease in the discount rate would decrease increase projected opeb expense by less than million in each of  and a increase decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase decrease the projected service and interest cost components of opeb expense by approximately million in and by million in each of and based upon current projections  the company will be required to pay the following opeb benefits over the next ten years projected projected projected projected net gross payments retiree part d payments contributions subsidy in millions year ended december  through environmental matters

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  asset lives  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors it believes to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
inventory allowances 
prior to january   approximately of the company s inventories were determined using the lifo method  with the balance determined primarily using an average cost method 
effective january   the company changed its method for inventory costing from the lifo method to the specific identification cost method for the inventories previously accounted for under the lifo cost method 
with the significant volatility seen recently in raw material prices  the company believes this change in accounting method provides a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as required by gaap  the company has restated its financial statements for prior periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company periodically reviews its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and records any write down equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about alternative uses  market conditions and other factors 
impairment of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company undertakes an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
during  the company determined that certain of its manufacturing equipment would no longer be utilized in its operations  and  accordingly  recognized a million noncash abandonment charge to cost of sales 
in  no such events or circumstances indicated the need to perform such evaluation 
valuation and impairment of securities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the company s marketable securities  including the shares of compx contributed by the company and held by cgi based upon the company s redemption option  are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value based upon quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and or losses included in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company evaluates its investments in marketable securities whenever events or conditions occur to indicate that the fair value of such investments has declined below their carrying amounts 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the carrying amount of the security is written down to fair value 
in  no such events or circumstances indicated the need to perform such evaluation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
deferred income tax valuation allowances 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and related guidance  the company is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of deferred tax assets is not more likely than not 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or amount of  any valuation allowance 
see results of operations income taxes for discussion of the company s analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances 
pension and opeb expenses and obligations 
the company s pension and opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
the company reviews these rates annually with the assistance of its actuaries 
see further discussion of the factors considered and potential effect of these estimates in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
revenue recognition 
sales revenue is generally recognized when the company has certified that its product meets the related customer specifications  the product has been shipped  and title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
payments received from customers in advance of these criteria being met are recorded as customer advances until earned 
for inventory consigned to customers  sales revenue is recognized when i the terms of the consignment end  ii the company has completed performance of all significant obligations and iii title and substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
sales revenue is stated net of price and early payment discounts 
other loss contingencies 
accruals for estimated loss contingencies  including  but not limited to  product related liabilities  environmental remediation and litigation  are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure is made when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses often requires analysis of various projections that are dependent upon the future outcome of multiple factors  including costs  the findings of investigations and actions by the company and third parties

the subordinated debentures held by the capital trust provide a fixed coupon and are exposed to market risk from changing interest rates 
during  the trading volume of the bucs was minimal and  therefore  the company does not believe the last traded value of the bucs necessarily provides a fair value of the underlying subordinated debentures 
the bucs issued by the capital trust are publicly traded and are convertible  at the option of the holder  into timet common stock at the rate of shares of common stock per bucs 
based on the last traded value of timet common stock per share on or before december   the as converted value of the  bucs outstanding at december  which the company believes provides a reasonable estimate of fair value of the subordinated debentures was million
