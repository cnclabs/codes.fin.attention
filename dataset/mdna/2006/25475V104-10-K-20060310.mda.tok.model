item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
throughout this discussion and analysis  we discuss our two business segments for financial reporting purposes  northern and proton 
northern is our distributed generation systems business segment and proton is our hydrogen generator business segment 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements and as a result of several factors  including the factors described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and other securities exchange act filings 

table of contents overview we provide products and services for distributed  or on site  power generation and storage 
using our systems  which produce energy at or near the place where it is used  our customers gain greater control over power quality  costs and management of their energy needs 
we design  integrate  construct and maintain power systems using a variety of technologies and energy sources both for grid connected customers and for customers who need power solutions for remote locations or require more reliable or environmentally benign alternatives to centrally distributed electricity 
we also market our hydrogen generators  which produce hydrogen from electricity and water in a clean and efficient process  to domestic and international customers for industrial  utility and research applications 
we are developing additional technologies and products for the distributed energy market  including systems that provide backup power and energy storage  hydrogen generators that produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles  power network architectures that link diverse power generating sources and advanced wind turbine generators 
our distributed generation systems produce electricity from conventional fuels and from cleaner  more sustainable sources such as wind  sunlight and biofuels  using reliable power generation technologies integrated with custom controls and power electronics 
we have installed over systems in more than countries during over years of operations 
our diverse customer base ranges from those who use our systems in remote applications  such as oil and gas pipelines and telecommunications facilities  to grid connected customers who use our systems for large commercial office buildings and manufacturing facilities 
our customers include s 
c 
johnson son  inc  equity office properties trust  the timberland company and honeywell international inc our hydrogen generator systems utilize proprietary proton exchange membrane  or pem  electrochemical technology to produce hydrogen through the electrolysis of water 
our hydrogen generators have been designed to address the existing demand for industrial hydrogen in a safer and more cost effective manner than truck delivered hydrogen 
we have installed over hydrogen generators in more than countries over more than five years of operations 
our hydrogen generators are also being used in demonstration projects to supply fuel to fuel cell vehicles 
we are developing core pem technology to combine our hydrogen generator technology with a fuel cell power generator to create an energy device that is able to produce and store hydrogen fuel that it can later use to generate electricity  which we refer to as a regenerative fuel cell system 
in the longer term  we believe our regenerative fuel cell systems will enable renewable energy solutions by facilitating the storage of energy produced by non depleting  non polluting energy sources  such as solar  wind and hydroelectric power 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  depreciable lives of equipment  warranty obligations and contingency accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a complete description of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our audit committee has discussed our critical accounting policies with management and our independent registered public accounting firm 

table of contents our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition product revenue all of our product revenue is derived from the operations of our proton segment 
for product sales for which adequate product warranty information exists  we record revenue when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred  sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if customer acceptance of products is not assured  revenue is recorded only upon formal customer acceptance 
customer acceptance provisions included in our product sales agreements include written acceptance from the customer  acceptance upon servicing and installation of the equipment  and acceptance after a period of time 
revenue for product sales to distributors  for which there are no rights of return or price adjustments on unsold inventory  is recognized on a gross basis upon shipment to the distributors  as they assume title and risk of loss  subject to the deferral provisions below 
for all product sales where adequate product warranty information does not yet exist to reasonably estimate warranty costs as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we defer revenue and costs until the expiration of the product warranty period 
we currently defer revenue on hogen h series delivered products until the related warranty costs can be reasonably estimated 
we only defer production costs on our delivered products to the extent that such production costs are not in excess of the sales price and realization is reasonably assured 
during  we determined that we had adequate product warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to our hogen s series and our laboratory generators 
therefore  in the first quarter of  we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of laboratory generators with a two year warranty upon shipment  and in the third quarter of  we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of our hogen s series hydrogen generators upon shipment 
we also earn revenue from the rental of our hogen products 
we account for the agreements as operating leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for leases 
the agreements are cancelable at any time by either party without penalty 
rental revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental agreement 
revenue recognition contract revenue the majority of our contract revenue is derived from the operations of our northern segment 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several months to several years  and the estimation of these costs requires management s judgment 
the long term nature and complexity of these contracts can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely 
as a result  we review and update our costs estimates on a quarterly basis or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate 
losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
we derive contract revenues from government sponsored research and development contracts and from commercial customers 
for government sponsored research and development contracts that are fixed price  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
for fixed price incentive  or cost reimbursement contracts that do not require us to meet specific obligations  revenue is recorded as work is performed 
for those research and development contracts that require us to meet specified obligations  including delivery and acceptance obligations  amounts advanced are recognized as contract liabilities until such obligations are met 
once the obligations are met  the amounts are recognized as contract revenue 
we principally generate commercial contract revenue from projects in our remote infrastructure  on site generation  and renewable energy field product lines 
for projects with a duration of greater than three months where the company has the ability to reasonably estimate total project costs to complete  revenue is recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method  which is based on the relationship of costs 
table of contents incurred to total estimated contract costs 
for overhaul contracts  revenue is recorded as work is performed 
for maintenance contracts  revenue is recognized over the service period 
for all other commercial contracts  the company recognizes revenue under the completed contract method 
warranty costs our warranty policy is limited to replacement parts and services and generally expires one year from date of shipment or contract completion  except with respect to laboratory hydrogen generators  where the warranty period is two years 
estimated warranty obligations are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical warranty experience and the current repair costs 
adjustments are made to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
should we experience actual repair costs that are higher than the estimated repair costs used to calculate the provision  our results of operations for the period or periods in which such additional costs materialize will be adversely affected 
inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
this policy requires us to write down our inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value to reflect assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions become less favorable than anticipated  or  if our ability to realize value on our inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable to business combinations completed after june  these standards require the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  set forth the accounting for the initial recognition of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  and describe the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill subsequent to initial recognition 
under the provisions of these standards  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment testing and will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
the annual impairment test compares the carrying values of the reporting unit to its fair value  which is estimated using the income approach discounted cash flow method  and  if the carrying value is less than its fair value  an impairment is recognized 
long lived assets we evaluate potential impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes procedures for the review of recoverability and measurement of impairment  if necessary  of long lived assets held and used by an entity 
sfas no 
requires that those assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of long lived assets is not recoverable based on its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is then based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 

table of contents stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock based compensation plans  including employee stock option plans 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to account for stock based compensation issued to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is computed to the extent that the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeds the exercise price of the employee stock option or stock award 
compensation so computed is then recognized over the vesting period 
we account for stock based compensation issued to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
and the consensus in emerging issues task force these pronouncements require the fair value of equity instruments given as consideration for services rendered be recognized as a non cash charge to income over the shorter of the vesting or service period 
the equity instruments must be revalued on each subsequent reporting date until performance is complete with a cumulative catch up adjustment recognized for any changes in their fair value 
the following table highlights the impact that each of the various assumptions has on determining the fair value of an option or award when using an option pricing model impact of inputs to value of equity instrument volatility of stock higher the volatility higher the value expected term longer the term higher the value risk free rate higher the rate higher the value dividend yield lower the yield higher the value exercise price lower the exercise price a higher the value stock price fair value higher the stock price higher the value a presumes exercise is less than fair value as described below we will change the way we account for stock based compensation in the first quarter of as such  a decrease in net income will result 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no

 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principles 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
under previous guidance  changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative effect in the net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retroactive application of changes in accounting principle  limited to the direct effects of the change  to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas no 
provisions are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning 
table of contents after december  we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  or fin fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin became effective for us on january  and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
this statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
currently  companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements and we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas r  however  in adopting this statement  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption we have used continues to be available  but we have not yet completed our assessment of the alternatives 
sfas r will be effective for us beginning january  we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and anticipate that sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations and loss per share 
we are currently reviewing the method of adoption  including the transition method  method of attribution for compensation cost  valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards 
currently  we anticipate utilizing the modified prospective application as the transition method 
a company that chooses to utilize the modified prospective application will not restate its prior financial statements 
instead  we will apply sfas r for new awards granted after the adoption of sfas r  any portion of awards that were granted after december  that have not vested by the date the company adopts sfas r  and any outstanding liability awards 
we also anticipate utilizing the straight line method  which allocates expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award 
in regards to valuation methods  we anticipate utilizing the simplified method for plain vanilla options as discussed within staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 and anticipate relying primarily on historical volatility 
sfas r is effective for us beginning january  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
is effective for us for inventory costs incurred beginning january  this statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
