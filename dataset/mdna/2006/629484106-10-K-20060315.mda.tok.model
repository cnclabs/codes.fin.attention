item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview and highlights year net income of million or per diluted share gross premium growth in core lines of over net investment income growth of over favorable net loss reserve development reported on prior year loss reserves of million total cash and invested assets of million at year end total shareholders equity of million  or per diluted share repurchased  shares of common stock at per share total after tax impact of hurricanes katrina and rita to the company were million or a reduction in earnings per diluted share of formed business relationships with various program managers to produce additional property and casualty insurance premiums results of operations the company s results of operations are derived from participation in pools of insurance covering ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and other liability insurance managed by mmo and affiliates 
since january   the company s participation in the pools has been increased to 
the company formerly wrote aircraft business  but has ceased writing any new policies covering aircraft insurance for periods subsequent to march  the company records premiums written in the year policies are issued and earns such premiums on a monthly pro rata basis over the terms of the respective policies 
the following tables present the company s gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for each of the past three years 
nymagic gross premiums written by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine inland marine fire other liability subtotal run off lines aircraft total 
table of contents nymagic net premiums written by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine inland marine fire other liability subtotal run off lines aircraft total nymagic net premiums earned by segment year ended december  dollars in thousands ocean marine inland marine fire other liability subtotal run off lines aircraft total unlike many types of property and casualty insurance  ocean marine  inland marine  aircraft and other liability premium rates are not strictly regulated by governmental authorities 
consequently  the company is able to adjust premium rates quickly in response to competition  varying degrees of risk and other factors 
in addition  the company  by virtue of its underwriting flexibility  is able to emphasize specific lines of business in response to advantageous premium rates and its anticipation of positive underwriting results 
however  the insurance industry is highly competitive and the companies against which the company competes may seek to limit any market premium rate 
the property and casualty industry historically has been highly cyclical 
rates for property and casualty insurance are influenced primarily by factors that are outside of our control  including competition and the amount of available capital and surplus in the industry 
for example  the substantial losses in the insurance industry arising from the events of september  caused rates in the insurance industry to rise 
however  new capital has since flowed into the insurance industry 
to the extent that more capital is available  there may be downward pressure on premium rates as a result of increased supply 
these factors affecting rates for the industry in general impact the rates we are able to charge 
any significant decrease in the rates for property and casualty insurance could reduce our net income 
while rates impact our net income  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the level of rate increases or decreases and net income because other factors  such as the amount of catastrophe losses and the amount of expenses  also affect net income 
prevailing policy terms and conditions in the property and casualty insurance market are also highly cyclical 
changes in terms and conditions unfavorable to insurers  which tend to be correlated with declining rates  could further reduce our net income 
even as rates rise  the average percentage rate increases can fluctuate greatly and be difficult to predict 
the company s general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense  employee benefits  professional fees and rental expense for office facilities 
the company s policy acquisition costs include brokerage commissions and premium taxes both of which are primarily based on a percentage of premiums written 
acquisition costs have generally changed in proportion to changes in premium volume 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in connection with insurance claims in any particular year depend upon a variety of factors including the rate of inflation  accident or claim frequency  the occurrence of natural catastrophes and the number of policies written 
the company estimates reserves each year based upon  and in conformity with  the factors discussed under business reserves 
changes in estimates of reserves are reflected in operating results in the year in which the change occurs 

table of contents year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was million or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the decrease in net income for was primarily attributable to after tax losses of million from hurricanes katrina and rita 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in net investment income 
the impact from hurricanes katrina and rita to the company in were as follows in thousands gross losses incurred ceded losses incurred net losses incurred reinsurance reinstatement costs total pre tax loss incurred total after tax loss incurred increase in combined ratio total revenues for the year ended december  were million compared with million for the year ended december  primarily reflecting increases in both net premiums earned and net investment income 
net realized investment losses after taxes were  or 
per diluted share  as compared with net realized investment gains of  or 
per diluted share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased by  and  respectively  when compared to the same period of net premiums written in decreased by when compared to reinstatement premiums of million relating to hurricanes rita and katrina adversely affected net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to million in reinstatement premiums resulting from hurricane ivan which affected net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  premiums for each segment are discussed below ocean marine gross premiums written for the year were up when compared to net premiums written and net premiums earned in decreased by and  respectively  compared to gross premiums in primarily reflected an increase in cargo production and rig premiums that was offset by a decrease in volume in the hull class of business due to a desired reduction in unprofitable accounts 
additionally  gross premiums written in generally reflected flat premium rates  however  rig rates have increased substantially in the period subsequent to the occurrence of hurricane katrina 
both net premiums written and net premiums earned in were reduced by million in reinstatement reinsurance premiums as a result of losses sustained from hurricanes katrina and rita 
this compared to million in reinstatement reinsurance premiums recorded in resulting from hurricane ivan 
the company decreased its net exposure to million for any one risk or any one occurrence effective on policies incepting on or after january  compared with million for any one risk or any one occurrence effective on policies incepting on or after january  the reduction in net loss retention had the effect of slightly decreasing net premiums written and earned in while the company is currently achieving significant rate increases in its offshore energy book as a result of recent industry wide hurricane losses  there is no assurance that such rate increases will be sustained during the excess of loss reinsurance market for the marine and energy line of business has also significantly tightened in  resulting in increases in both reinsurance costs and net loss retentions to the company in as a result of the tightening in the reinsurance market  the company excluded energy business with exposures in the gulf of mexico from its ocean marine reinsurance program for the company has purchased additional reinsurance protection for this portion of its energy business to reduce the potential impact of future catastrophe losses to the company 
the company also intends to monitor its overall concentration of rig exposures in the gulf of mexico  which may result in a reduction in policy count in in light of the foregoing  the level of gross and net energy writings for remains uncertain at this time 
inland marine fire gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  increased by  and  respectively  when compared to the same period of both gross and net writings in reflect additional production in existing classes from policies covering inland marine  fire  and motor truck cargo and new production sources in the surety class 
increases in volume were also achieved in the fire class as a result of focusing on smaller assureds with fewer locations 
gross premiums written in reflected mildly lower market rates when compared to other liability gross premiums written  net premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  rose by  
table of contents and  respectively  when compared to mainly as a result of premium volume increases from existing classes professional liability and contractors liability and partially from new classes commercial automobile liability 
gross premiums written from the professional liability and other non marine liability classes  including contractors liability  grew from million and million  respectively  in to million and million  respectively  in offsetting the increase in gross and net premiums written in was a reduction in gross and net excess workers compensation premiums of million and million  respectively  relating to policies written during the fourth quarter of with sixteen month terms 
premium rates were level to down slightly during when compared to net premiums earned in also reflected the volume increases achieved over the prior year 
the amount of both gross and net premiums written in the other liability line of business is anticipated to increase in as a result of providing higher gross and net limits on its existing inforce of excess workers compensation policies 
the level of growth in gross and net premium volume is dependent on several factors and  accordingly  cannot be currently estimated 
aircraft premiums were nominal in and as a result of the company having ceased writing new aircraft policies subsequent to march  net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of net premiums earned the loss ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the higher loss ratio in is primarily the result of losses and reinsurance reinstatement costs sustained in the ocean marine line from hurricanes katrina and rita  which added to the overall loss ratio 
in comparison  losses and reinsurance reinstatement costs recorded from hurricane ivan added to the overall loss ratio 
the inland marine fire loss ratios for were higher than  reflecting a higher frequency of larger severity claims occurring in the current accident year 
the other liability loss ratio improved in when compared to the loss ratio in primarily reflecting the growth in professional liability writings and excess liability lines of business  which had lower loss ratios than other classes of other liability business 
the company decreased net loss reserves by approximately million in from the year end net unpaid loss reserve amount of million as a result of favorable loss reserve development 
this compared to million of favorable loss reserve development recorded in the favorable loss reserve benefit recorded in was due in large part from the ocean marine line of business  particularly in the accident years 
as the company s net loss retention increased substantially in the ocean marine line during the accident years  actual loss emergence has been less than previously anticipated 
the other liability line also reported favorable development in years prior to resulting from a lower than expected emergence of losses attributable to a shorter loss reporting tail than originally estimated 
additional favorable development of aircraft loss reserves occurred  which was largely attributable to the accident year 
the favorable loss development in was partially offset by adverse net loss development resulting from provisions made for insolvent  financially impaired reinsurers and commuted reinsurance contracts  partly as a result of an increase in ceded incurred losses relating to a few specific asbestos claims 
the million of favorable loss development recorded in primarily resulted from the favorable development of aircraft loss reserves  which was largely attributable to the accident year 
this amounted to million  or of the overall loss ratio  and related to the events occurring on september  specifically  the loss reserves relating to the terrorist attacks of september  on the pentagon and the hijacked airliner that crashed in pennsylvania were reduced as a result of lower than expected losses 
additional favorable development occurred in the ocean marine line for the accident years 
partially offsetting these favorable developments in were losses incurred of million from the company s other liability line reflecting reserve strengthening relating to a few specific umbrella exposures stemming from asbestos losses 
policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  were as compared with for the year ended december  the increase in the ratio is primarily due to a higher ocean marine ratio resulting from the impact of reinsurance reinstatement costs arising from hurricanes katrina and rita 
while the other liability acquisition cost ratio in was comparable to the ratio  the inland marine fire line acquisition cost ratio was lower in than reflecting slightly lower commissions 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in was largely attributable to an increase in employee related expenses to service the growth in the company s business operations 
also contributing to the increase in were higher administrative expenses resulting from professional fees and the implementation of computer systems 
the company s combined ratio the loss ratio plus the ratio of policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses divided by premiums earned was for the year compared with for losses incurred  including reinsurance reinstatement costs  from hurricanes katrina and rita added to the combined ratio for the year ended december  net investment income for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended

the limited partnership portfolio reflected higher returns from its various economic strategies  with the largest returns from equity fund investments 
the fixed maturity available for sale and short term investment portfolios increased due to higher investment yields 
further contributing to the overall increase in investment income was a larger invested asset base derived from favorable cash flows over the past year and the proceeds received from our million senior notes issued on march  partially offsetting the increase in net investment income in was lower overall income derived from trading portfolio activities

this review includes considering the effect of rising interest rates and the company s intent and ability to hold impaired securities in the foreseeable future to recoup any losses 
in addition to subjecting its securities to the objective tests of percent declines in fair value and downgrades by major rating agencies  when it determines whether declines in the fair value of its securities are other than temporary  the company also considers the facts and circumstances that may have caused the declines in the value of such securities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to changes in the fair value of financial instruments  which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality  hedge fund and cdo investments 
the largest market risk to the company is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
the company considers interest rate risk and the overall duration of the company s loss reserves in evaluating the company s investment portfolio 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
taxable securities also include mortgage backed securities that have prepayment features which may cause actual cash flows to differ from those based upon maturity date 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair after cost value tax exempts average interest rate taxables average interest rate total 
table of contents credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
as of december   of the fair value of the company s fixed income and short term investment portfolios were considered investment grade 
as of december   the company invested approximately million in fixed maturities that are below investment grade  with a concentration in investments rated bb by s p 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by maintaining a diversified portfolio of such securities that limits the concentration of investment in any one issuer 
the largest single investment made by the company in such securities amounted to of the total amount invested in below investment grade securities 
hedge fund risk includes the potential loss from the diminution in the value of the underlying investment of the hedge fund 
hedge fund investments are subject to various economic and market risks 
the risks associated with hedge fund investments may be substantially greater than the risks associated with fixed income investments 
consequently  our hedge fund portfolio may be more volatile  and the risk of loss greater  than that associated with fixed income investments 
as the company invests a greater percentage of its investment portfolio in limited partnership hedge funds  there may also be a greater volatility associated with the company s investment income 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries has revised its investment policy and now limits the amount of hedge fund investments to the greater of of invested assets or of policyholders surplus 
the company also seeks to mitigate market risk associated with its investments in hedge funds by maintaining a diversified portfolio of hedge fund investments 
diversification is achieved through the use of many investment managers employing a variety of different investment strategies in determining the underlying characteristics of their hedge funds 
the company is dependent upon these managers to obtain market prices for the underlying investments of the hedge funds 
some of these investments may be difficult to value and actual values may differ from reported amounts 
the hedge funds in which we invest usually impose limitations on the timing of withdrawals from the hedge funds most are within days  and may affect our liquidity 
with respect to an investment in tiptree  the company cannot withdraw funds for a minimum period of three years from its initial investment in without the consent of the hedge fund manager 
any withdrawals made require one year s prior written notice to the hedge fund manager 
the company invests in cdos  which are private placements 
the fair value of each security is provided by securities dealers 
the markets for these types of securities can be illiquid and  therefore  the price obtained from dealers on these securities is subject to change  depending upon the underlying market conditions of these securities  including the potential for downgrades or defaults on the underlying collateral of the security 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by maintaining a diversified portfolio of such securities that limits the concentration of investment in any one issuer 
the excess of cost over the fair value of the cdos was recorded in net investment income and amounted to  at december  the largest single investment made by the company in such securities amounted to million 
the total amount invested in cdos at fair value as of december  was million 
the company maintains an investment in a limited partnership hedge fund  tiptree  that invests in cdos  credit related structured product crs securities and other structured product securities that are structured  managed or advised by a mariner affiliated company 
this investment is consolidated in the company s financial statements 
cdos and crss are purchased by various broker dealers 
such purchases are then repackaged and sold to investors within a relatively short time period  normally within a few months 
tiptree earns a fee for servicing these arrangements and provides a margin account as collateral to secure the credit risk of the purchases made by the dealers under these agreements 
as of december  and  tiptree provided and million in cash as collateral to secure any purchases made by the dealers 
tiptree does not share in the gains or losses on investments held by the dealer 
management expects that only under a remote circumstance would the margin account be drawn by the dealer to secure losses 
many of the securities purchased are investment grade floating rate securities and large unrealized losses are not normally expected to occur 
the company seeks to mitigate market risk associated with such investments by concentrating on investment grade  floating rate securities with the risk of loss being limited to the cash held in the margin accounts 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with mariner  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines  the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the company s investments
