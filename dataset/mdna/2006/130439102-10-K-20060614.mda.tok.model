overview we design and sell application specific analog semiconductor products for high volume applications in the mobile handset  personal computer and digital consumer electronics markets  which we describe as our core markets 
we are a leading supplier of application specific integrated passive asip devices for mobile handsets that provide electromagnetic interference emi filtering and electrostatic discharge esd protection and of asip devices for personal computers  personal computer peripherals and digital consumer electronics that provide low capacitance esd protection 
both types of asip devices are used primarily to protect various interfaces  both external and internal  used in our customers products 
our asip devices  built using our proprietary silicon manufacturing process technology  provide the function of multiple passive components in a single chip solution 
they occupy significantly less space  cost our customers less  taking into account the total cost of implementation  and offer increased performance and reliability compared to traditional solutions based on discrete passive components 
some of our asip devices also integrate active analog elements to provide additional functionality 
we also offer selected active analog devices that complement our asip devices 
they include integrated led drivers and interface circuits for mobile handsets 
our active analog device solutions use industry standard manufacturing processes for cost effectiveness 
within the past four years  we have streamlined our operations and become completely fabless using independent providers of wafer fabrication services 
we have focused our marketing and sales on strategic customers in our three core markets 
as a part of this process  we have reduced the number of our actively marketed products from approximately  to approximately while at the same time increasing our unit volume shipments from million units in fiscal to million units in fiscal end customers for our semiconductor products are original equipment manufacturers oems 
we sell to some of these end customers through original design manufacturers odms and contract electronics manufacturers cems 
we use a direct sales force  manufacturers representatives and distributors to sell our products 
we operate in one operating segment and most of our physical assets are located outside the united states 
assets located outside the united states include product inventories and manufacturing equipment consigned to our contract wafer manufacturers  assemblers and test houses 
results of operations net sales 
net sales by market were as follows in millions year ended march  change over over mobile handset personal computer and digital consumer total core market medical and other products total includes million of esd diode products which during would have been classified as other products 
other products include lighting  communications  legacy and mature products 
net sales by geographic region were as follows in millions  based on where we ship our products rather than where the customers headquarters are located year ended march  amount of total amount of total amount of total china korea taiwan singapore japan and other total asia pacific united states canada  mexico and brazil total americas europe total net sales international sales increased from of our net sales in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal our china region s revenue was approximately of our total sales and continued to be our fastest growing region  increasing compared to fiscal and reflecting a strong supply chain base of our customers in that region 
the decline in sales in our americas region in fiscal compared to fiscal reflected our discontinuing medical and other non core products in late fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to represent a majority of our sales for the foreseeable future 
fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from the million of net sales in fiscal our growth in sales from products for the mobile handset market was primarily the result of increased penetration as measured by the average number of our parts per handset shipped  and secondarily the result of market growth 
sales from products for the personal computer and digital consumer market were up by for fiscal compared to fiscal  which was primarily driven by increased sales of our low capacitance esd products 
our revenue growth in our core markets came primarily from existing products  and secondarily from new products 
the absence of product sales in non core markets was the result of our discontinuing those products during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result our sales in these markets declined from million in fiscal to zero in fiscal the increased sales in products for our core markets exceeded the sales we lost due to exiting our non core markets in fiscal our overall average unit price declined to from during fiscal compared to fiscal of this decline  approximately represented the weighted average price decline on a constant mix of products that were sold in both periods and the remaining of the decline was due to changes in product mix 
in the future we expect our average unit selling price for like products based on a constant mix to decline at a rate of approximately per annum 
in fiscal unit shipments increased to approximately million units from approximately million units in fiscal fiscal versus net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or from the million of net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales to the mobile handset market was partially offset by declines in our other markets 
our increased sales resulted primarily from larger unit sales  due in part from increased sales of current products and in part from sales of newly introduced products 
our average unit price decreased by during fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was due to three factors a the faster growth in sales of our mobile handset products  which sell at lower prices than products for the other markets  b reductions in average selling prices of individual products  and c the decline in the portion of our sales from medical and other products which sold at relatively high prices 
our growth in mobile handset sales was primarily the result of increased penetration and secondarily the result of market growth 
the decline in personal computer and digital consumer sales was due to a decline in our older products 
the decline in medical was the result of lower demand from our principal customer  guidant  and our discontinuing these products during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales of our other products  which includes lighting  communications  legacy and mature products  also declined due to our having largely completed end of life shipments during fiscal fiscal unit shipments increased to approximately million units from approximately million units in fiscal comparison of gross margin and expenses the table below shows our sales  cost of sales  gross margin and expenses  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal  and in thousands year ended march  amount of net sales amount of net sales amount of net sales net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring other income expense  net income before income taxes income taxes benefit net income includes million of partial release of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for fiscal see note of notes to financial statements 
gross margin fiscal versus gross margin increased by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due to the following reasons gross margin increase decrease  in millions volume of products for core markets cost reductions of products for core markets and other net reserve changes for products for core markets price change of products for core markets end of sales for products for non core markets the gross margin increase from volume of products for our core markets was primarily driven by a increase in sales of our products used in mobile handsets for fiscal there was a decrease in gross margin related to our product sales for non core markets for fiscal as we exited those markets and eliminated our sales 
the cost reductions of products for our core markets were the result of process cost reductions and lower subcontractor costs both by sourcing with lower cost subcontractors and by cost reductions at existing subcontractors for both fiscal and fiscal the increase in net inventory reserve expense was due to an increase in demand reserves and end of life inventory reserves on older core products  which in part reflected a shift in the market from eutectic to green products 
also in fiscal  we recognized a benefit of approximately million relating to the sale of inventory that had been reserved in prior periods  compared to million in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal our long range gross margin target is to 
fiscal versus gross margin increased by million in fiscal to million  which represented a increase from fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase in gross margin was as follows gross margin increase decrease  in millions cost reductions of products volume of products price change of products net reserve changes of products product mix change product cost reductions were the result of lower subcontractor costs  cost reductions from scaling back and then closing our tempe wafer fabrication facility and product redesigns 
the increased gross margin from volume was driven by a increase in our mobile handset product sales  offset by reductions in our medical  personal computer and other products 
the increase in gross margin from additional volume was offset by the change in mix during fiscal the prices for our products in the mobile handset  personal computer and digital consumer markets are normally expected to decline over time 
during fiscal  the decrease in prices was primarily in our mobile handset products  which was partially offset by increases in medical products for a net negative impact of million 
the change in net inventory reserves was the result of substantially lower sales of previously reserved inventories 
during fiscal  we primarily sold the saleable portion of the end of life products that we had reserved in prior periods and during fiscal a significant portion of the previously reserved end of life inventory was scrapped as there was no longer demand 
the change in product mix was primarily due to a shift to mobile handset products from our medical and other products which had recently been generating above average margins due to end of life pricing and our ability to reduce costs during the shut down related to our medical products exit 
although our fiscal gross margin as a percentage of sales improved over fiscal by basis points to  there was a significant variation within the quarters of fiscal in each of the first two quarters  we generated approximately gross margin  which declined to in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
the third quarter was adversely impacted by price declines for some of our core products that exceeded our cost reduction programs  and the proportional decline of our non core sales which were generating above average margins 
the fourth quarter was further impacted by the requirement to recognize larger than normal inventory reserves due to changes in the demand for our older power management products and the further decline in non core product sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other related costs for employee  prototypes  masks and other expenses for the development of new products  process technology and packages 
the changes in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal  were as follows fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal expense increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year in thousands outside services process engineering other expenses prototypes salaries and benefits bonus expense outside services increased in fiscal primarily due to outsourced design services for new products 
process engineering expenses increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal due to requirements related to new r d projects in fiscal and discontinuation of the tempe process engineering operation during fiscal  respectively 
salaries and benefits increased in fiscal due to higher salary expenses and additional expenses associated with changes in the executive management of design while the increase in fiscal was primarily due to hiring additional engineers to increase new product development activity 
as we continued to increase r d activities  we increased prototype material spending in each of fiscal and fiscal bonus expense increased in fiscal and declined in fiscal due to company performance compared to the performance target in each year s plan 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other employee related costs  sales commissions  marketing expenses  legal  accounting  and information technology expenses 
the changes in selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal  were as follows fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal expense increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year in thousands bonus expense information technology travel salaries and benefits product samples other expenses outside services bonus expense increased in fiscal and declined in fiscal due to company performance compared to the target in each year s plan 
information technology increased due to twelve months of oracle erp related expenses in fiscal compared to only six months of oracle erp expenses during fiscal as our implementation of the oracle erp system was in october travel and product samples increased due to additional sales and marketing promotion activity 
salaries and benefits increased primarily due to higher salary expenses during fiscal and additional staffing in sales and marketing during fiscal outside services decreased in fiscal primarily due to decreased professional fees related to section of the sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts which are being performed utilizing mostly internal resources while the increase in outside services in fiscal was primarily due to our preparation for and initial compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
restructuring charges 
on october  our board of directors approved a plan to close our manufacturing operation in tempe  arizona and other associated activities 
the plan identified employees to be terminated  impaired assets and other shutdown costs 
the shutdown was a consequence of our strategic plan to focus our product development and sales and marketing efforts on selected markets  actively manage our product life cycles and outsource our manufacturing operations 
the tempe wafer fabrication facility was the final internal manufacturing operation to be closed 
restructuring expense was  and million for fiscal and  respectively 
there is no more restructuring expense associated with the closure of our tempe facility 
other income expense 
the increase in other income is due to interest income for fiscal of approximately million compared to  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs for fiscal was approximately  compared to  and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from increased interest rate and our having more cash as a result of our follow on may public offering  positive cash flow from operations  the sale of tempe related assets  issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans and the exercise of warrants 
the decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs resulted from paying off our long term debt in may using a portion of the net proceeds from our may public offering 
income taxes 
as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had recorded an adjustment reducing our valuation allowance against deferred tax asset which represents potential reduced taxes in the future resulting from the potential utilization of our loss carryforwards should we realize taxable income in the future 
because of the uncertainty of being able to realize that deferred tax asset  we had established a valuation allowance against it in prior years 
until march   that valuation allowance had been equal to the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
as of march   we determined that it is more likely than not that million of the deferred tax asset will be utilized as described in more detail under critical accounting policies and estimates below and accordingly we have reduced million of the valuation allowance 
the reduction of this valuation allowance creates a negative tax rate and as a result increases our after tax income 
however  it does not affect the taxes we pay currently 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on actual and forecasted operating results 
see also note of notes to financial statements 
our effective tax rate was and  respectively for fiscal and without consideration of the adjustment to the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate was and  respectively for fiscal and the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to our ability to utilize loss carry forwards and other credits  limited by alternative minimum tax provisions  and the reduction in the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  despite our having earned net income on a financial accounting basis  we incurred a loss on a tax basis primarily due to scrapping inventory during the fiscal year  as such there was no provision for income taxes 
net income loss 
for the reasons explained above  we realized net income of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and the known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance eg  revenue or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to end user customers  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have return rights  is recognized upon shipment and transfer of risk of loss  if we believe collection is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the customer s creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
reserves for sales returns and allowances from end user customers are estimated based on historical experience and management judgment  and are provided for at the time of shipment 
at the end of each reporting period  the sufficiency of the reserve for sales returns and allowances is also assessed based on a comparison to authorized returns for which a credit memo has not been issued 
revenue from sales of our standard products to distributors whose terms provide for price concessions or for product return rights is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end customer 
for our end of life products  if we believe that collection is probable  we recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor  because our contractual arrangements provide for no right of return or price concessions for those products 
when we sell products to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and its related cost and reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred margin on shipments to distributors 
inventory and related reserves our inventory and related reserves policy is described in note of notes to financial statements 
forecasting customer demand is the factor in our inventory and related reserves policy that involves significant judgments and estimates 
we establish a reserve for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next twelve months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
we also use historical trends as a factor in forecasting customer demand  especially that from our distributors 
we review our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering the known facts 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our cost of sales and gross margin could be impacted 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
early in fiscal  we acquired arques technology and we will be recording a significant amount of goodwill as an asset which we will need to examine for impairment 
this will involve estimating our future expected return from the arques assets which involves significant judgment 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  we do not record an expense for stock options granted with exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the option grant date 
stock based compensation related to non employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis under fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of each individual award 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award rather than apply the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb we will recognize costs determined under sfas r over the period during which an employee provides services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period  which is usually the vesting period 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards and plan to adopt using the modified prospective method 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and statement of cash flows 
however  uncertainties  including our future stock based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense that we will incur in future periods will be similar to the sfas pro forma expense disclosed in note of notes to financial statements 
in addition  the amount of stock based compensation expense to be incurred in future periods will be reduced by our acceleration of certain unvested and out of the money stock options in fiscal as disclosed in note of notes to financial statements 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheets 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that management believes recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against the company s deferred tax assets 
until march   we had determined that  in part due to the our recent cumulative tax loss history for the previous three year periods  income statement loss history over various quarters and years  and the transition to a fabless model and cessation of our medical business and the resulting uncertainties  that it was necessary to maintain a full valuation allowance to net against its deferred tax assets which as of march  totaled million 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards as of march  of million and million will expire at various dates from through  if not utilized and have a tax effect of million included in our deferred tax asset 
we have a federal research and development credit of million which expires in and a state research and development credit of million which lasts indefinitely 
the tax effect of these credits is million which is also included in our deferred tax asset 
our methodology for determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets involves estimates of future taxable income  the estimated impact of future stock option deductions  and the expiration dates and amounts of net operating loss carryforwards 
these estimates are based on near term projections and assumptions which management believes to be reasonable 
in concluding that a million release of the valuation allowance was required at the end of fiscal year  we considered both the positive and negative evidence regarding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
positive evidence included having achieved profitability for financial reporting purposes for the past four quarters  seven out of the last eight quarters  ten out of the last twelve quarters and for the past three fiscal years 
negative evidence included our reliance on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our business  the impact of future stock option deductions on taxable income  the financial statement loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the three years cumulative tax net operating losses through fiscal year in weighing the positive and negative evidence above  we considered the more likely than not criteria pursuant to sfas no 
as well as several of the risks under risk factors 
as described above  we concluded that the positive evidence outweighed the negative evidence as to million of the valuation allowance and accordingly released million of the valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or that these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to adjust the amount of the valuation allowance based on future determinations of whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in the valuation allowance through a partial or full release would be recorded as an income tax benefit or a reduction of income tax expense or a credit to stockholders equity whereas an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded as an income tax expense 
our net operating losses available to reduce future taxable income expire on various dates from fiscal year through fiscal year to the extent that we generate taxable income in jurisdictions where the deferred tax asset relates to net operating losses that have been offset by the valuation allowance  the utilization of these net operating losses would result in the reversal of the related valuation allowance 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on actual and forecasted operating results 
litigation we are a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the known relevant facts and circumstances  we recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
for these purposes  we consider settlement offers we may make to be indicative of such a loss under certain circumstances 
as of march   there were no accruals for settlement offers 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash generated from operations 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of march   compared to million at march   an increase of million or 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased million during fiscal which primarily reflects our moving of assets to short term investments 
operating activities provided million of cash for fiscal  due primarily to net income of million  an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of  and non cash charges that included depreciation and amortization of million and an increase to inventory reserves of million  which were reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a release in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million 
in fiscal  operating activities provided million of cash  due primarily to net income of million  non cash charges that included depreciation and amortization of million  fixed asset write downs of  and inventory write downs of million  which were reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million and a reduction in accounts payable and other current liabilities of million 
accounts receivable increased to million at march  compared to million a year earlier  primarily as a result of higher sales 
in addition  receivables days sales outstanding increased to days at march  as compared to days at march  we were able to reduce our net inventory to million as of march   compared to million at march   despite our greater sales activity 
inventory turns improved to at march  from at march  accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaled million at march  compared to million at march  the million increase was primarily due to higher accounts payable associated with increased sales activity at fiscal year end 
investing activities during fiscal used million of cash  primarily for the purchase of short term investments including the investment of the million of net proceeds from the sale of our tempe facility 
during fiscal  investing activities used million of cash  primarily as the result of our investing the million proceeds from our may public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million and was the result of million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of common stock warrants  offset by repayment of capital lease obligations of  net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million and was primarily the result of million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset by debt repayments of million 
the million stock proceeds were comprised of million raised in our may public stock offering  million of employee stock purchases and million of warrant exercises 
on september   we entered into an amended loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
under this one year agreement  for which there were  of commitment and related fees  the bank provided a million credit line  subject to financial and other covenants contained in the agreement 
the agreement expired on september  on october   we entered into an amended loan agreement with silicon valley bank which extended the million credit line for one year from the original september  termination date 
there were  of associated fees for the one year facility 
we granted the bank a continuing security interest in all of our assets other than our intellectual property against which there is a negative pledge agreement 
the agreement prohibits our paying cash dividends 
borrowings under this agreement bear interest at the current prime rate and interest is payable monthly 
the bank may withdraw the commitment if we fail to comply with the covenants  if there is a material adverse change in our business  operations or condition  if we become insolvent or if other specified events or conditions occur 
at march  the full amount of the credit line was available 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  payments due by period in thousands fiscal fiscal and fiscal and beyond fiscal total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months 
should we desire to expand our level of operations more quickly  either through increased internal development or through the acquisition of product lines from other entities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
the funds may not be available to us  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect upon our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors  other than operating leases and purchase obligations shown above 
impact of inflation and changing prices although we cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on net sales or income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of march  we held million of investments in short term  liquid debt securities 
due to the short duration and investment grade credit ratings of these instruments  we do not believe that there is a material exposure to interest rate risk in our investment portfolio 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
we have evaluated the estimated fair value of our financial instruments 
the amounts reported as cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
historically  the fair values of short term investments are estimated based on quoted market prices 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our long term debt obligations and their fair value as of march  and our long term debt obligations mature a half year from march  and one and a half years from march  the fair value of our long term debt is based on the estimated market rate of interest for similar debt instruments with the same remaining maturities 
at march  periods of maturity fair value as of march  thereafter total in thousands liabilities long term debt obligations weighted average interest rate at march  periods of maturity fair value as of march  thereafter total in thousands liabilities long term debt obligations weighted average interest rate we have little exposure to foreign currency risk as all our sales are denominated in us dollars as has been most of our spending as only a minor portion of our expenditures are paid out in asian currencies
