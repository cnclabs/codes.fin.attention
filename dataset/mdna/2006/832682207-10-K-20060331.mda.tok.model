overview we provide advanced electronics manufacturing services  or ems  to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  primarily in the industrial  enterprise computing and networking  and communications market segments 
we currently service our customers through manufacturing and technology centers strategically located in key technology corridors in the united states  canada  the cost effective location of mexico and our manufacturing relationship with china based alco electronic 
our full range of value added supply chain services include product design  procurement  prototyping  advanced cable and harness interconnect  high precision enclosures  printed circuit board assembly  test  final system build  comprehensive supply chain management  packaging  global distribution and after sales support 
as the technology sector grew rapidly in the years and  we sought to take advantage of such growth and completed several acquisitions 
when the technology sector declined  we found ourselves with significant excess capacity and incurred significant operating losses 
as a result  in fiscal years and  we began an operational restructuring that is substantially complete and involved closing six and selling one of our manufacturing facilities the plan and the plan  respectively 
in the first and second quarters of  we initiated a comprehensive transformation plan designed to restructure  recapitalize and restore profitability and growth 
the transformation plan had several components  including operational optimization  recapitalization  strategy development and organization renewal 
the recapitalization  which closed on june   consisted of three main components a private placement of equity securities  a transaction with smtc s pre existing lenders the pre existing lenders to repay a portion of smtc s pre existing debt and restructure the balance of smtc s pre existing debt and a new secured credit facility with wachovia capital finance of canada as successor to congress financial corporation and its affiliates wachovia

see liquidity and capital resources 
during the third quarter of  we announced changes to our manufacturing operations to provide greater focus on new customer and new product introduction and technical activities  improve capacity utilization  align our cost structure to expected revenue  and to become profitable on a sustained basis the plan 
in connection with the plan we recorded restructuring charges of million during the third and fourth quarters of during the third and fourth quarters of  the company also recorded a reversal of previously recorded lease and other contract obligations of million and a recovery of inventory previously written off of million  both in connection with the plan  and net charges of million in connection with the plan 
during fiscal year  we continued to execute our transformation plan to restore the company to growth and profitability and recorded further severance charges in connection with the plan of million and a net recovery of restructuring charges in connection with the plan of million 
having reduced capacity and costs  stabilized the stakeholder base and refinanced the balance sheet  our transformation plan was substantially complete as we exited the second quarter of with our primary focus moving to the execution of a strategy intended to grow revenue through a combination of increasing the level of business with current customers and new customer acquisition and restoring profitability to a satisfactory level 
the company has gained several important new customers and added a number of new program wins within our current customer base during fiscal year corporate history smtc corporation is the result of the july combination of surface mount and htm 
surface mount was established in toronto  ontario in htm was established in denver  colorado in smtc was established in delaware in after the combination  we purchased zenith electronics facility in chihuahua  mexico  which expanded our cost effective manufacturing capabilities in an important geographic region 
in september  we established a manufacturing presence in the northeastern united states and expanded our value added services to include high precision enclosure capabilities by acquiring boston  massachusetts based wf wood 
in july  we acquired pensar corporation  an ems company specializing in design engineering and headquartered in appleton  wisconsin 
on july   we consummated an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and  exchangeable shares of our subsidiary smtc manufacturing corporation of canada  or smtc canada 
each exchangeable share of smtc canada is exchangeable at the option of the holder at any time into one share of our common stock  subject to compliance with applicable securities laws 
on august   we sold an additional  shares of common stock upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
in november  we acquired qualtron teoranta  a provider of specialized cable and harness interconnect assemblies  based in donegal  ireland and with a subsidiary in haverhill  massachusetts

in fiscal  we closed our facility in cork  ireland 
in fiscal  we closed our facilities in donegal  ireland  austin  texas and charlotte  north carolina and sold the majority of our operations in appleton  wisconsin 
results of operations our contractual arrangements with our key customers generally provide a framework for our overall relationship with our customers 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when goods are shipped to customers since title has passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance has occurred  all customer specified test criteria have been met and the earnings process is complete 
the company also derives revenue from engineering and design services 
service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
actual production volumes are based on purchase orders for the delivery of products 
typically  these orders do not commit to firm production schedules for more than to days in advance 
to minimize inventory risk  generally we order materials and components only to the extent necessary to satisfy existing customer forecasts or purchase orders 
fluctuations in material costs typically are passed through to customers 
we may agree  upon request from our customers  to temporarily delay shipments  which causes a corresponding delay in our revenue recognition 
our fiscal year end is december the consolidated financial statements of smtc  are prepared in accordance with united states gaap  which conforms in all material respects to canadian gaap  except as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the transitional goodwill impairment charge of million was recognized in opening retained earnings under canadian gaap 
under united states gaap  the cumulative adjustment was recognized in earnings during there were no canadian gaap differences in in and  canadian gaap requires companies to expense the fair value of stock based compensation awarded to employees over the vesting period of the stock options 
in and  us gaap  required companies to calculate and disclose pro forma information related to fair value of stock based compensation but they were not required to record a related compensation expense 
under canadian gaap  an adjustment of million to increase the opening deficit with an offsetting adjustment to paid in capital  and a compensation expense of million and million would be recorded in and  respectively 
effective for periods ending on or after june   as a result of the emerging issues committee abstract no 
 exchangeable securities issued by subsidiaries of income trusts eic  canadian gaap requires companies to present exchangeable securities as liabilities or minority interest rather than within equity 
based on the characteristics of the company s exchangeable shares  the company has classified them as non controlling interest for canadian gaap purposes  in accordance with eic consequently  the company has reduced the loss recorded in and the income recorded in by the share of income or loss attributable to the non controlling interest for canadian gaap purposes 
as of december   the balance of the noncontrolling interest under canadian gaap had been reduced to nil as a result of the conversion of exchangeable shares to common stock and the allocation of the noncontrolling interest share of losses and deficit in current and prior years 
under canadian gaap  if the non controlling interest balance had not been reduced to nil  it would be presented between liabilities and shareholders equity on the balance sheet 
as the exchangeable shares are considered non controlling interest for canadian gaap purposes  they are excluded from the basic earnings per share denominator 
exchangeable shares are considered in the diluted earnings per share calculation using the if converted method when the effect is dilutive 
the following table sets forth certain operating data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december  december  december  revenue cost of sales includes a recovery of previously recorded restructuring charges of million and net other charges of million for the year ended december  gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses includes adjustments to previously recorded other charges of million for the year ended december  amortization restructuring and other charges  including the write down of intangible assets operating earnings loss interest earnings loss before income taxes  discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy income taxes recovery earnings loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations net earnings loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decline in revenue resulted from lower production volume from ibm as this program nears completion and the effect of the loss in fiscal year of square d as a customer 
this resulted in approximately million and million  respectively  in lower revenue from these customers for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this was somewhat offset by growth in revenue from emc of million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year and from the addition of certain customers during while annual revenues declined from fiscal year to fiscal year  quarterly revenue for the third and fourth quarters of were higher than corresponding quarters in because of the effects of new customer wins and new program wins within our current customer base 
during fiscal year  revenue from the industrial sector represented of revenue compared to of revenue for fiscal year the percentage of sales attributable to the enterprise computing and networking sector and the communications sector was and  respectively  for fiscal year compared to and  respectively  for fiscal year the reduction in the percentage of revenue generated from the industrial sector in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is largely due to the effect of the loss of square d as a customer in fiscal year the increase in the percentage of revenue generated from the computing and networking sector in compared to is due to the growth in revenue earned from emc in compared to the same period last year  partially offset by the reduction in revenue earned from ibm in compared to the same period last year 
the increase in the percentage of revenue earned from the communications sector in compared to is due to the increase in revenue earned from a number of our smaller customers in compared to during fiscal year  we recorded approximately million of sales of raw materials inventory to customers  which carried no margin  compared to million in fiscal year the company purchases raw materials based on customer purchase orders 
to the extent the customer requires these orders to be altered or changed  the customer is generally obligated to purchase the original on order raw material 
due to changes in market conditions  the life cycle of products  the nature of specific programs and other factors  customer volumes produced by the company typically vary from year to year 
during fiscal year  the company s ten largest customers represented approximately of revenue compared to during fiscal year revenue from our three largest customers during fiscal year was million from emc  million from ingenico and million from mars electronics  representing  and  respectively  of total revenue for fiscal year this compares with revenue of million from ibm  million from ingenico and million from mars electronics representing  and  respectively  of total revenue for fiscal year no other customers represented more than of revenue in either year 
during fiscal year  of our revenue was produced from operations in mexico  from the united states and from canada 
during fiscal year  of our revenue was produced from operations in mexico  from the united states and from canada 
the increase in production in the united states is the result of the increase in revenue earned from emc compared to the prior year 
the decrease in production in canada is due to certain product lines being transferred to our lower cost mexico facility 
the company operates in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace in which current and prospective customers from time to time seek to lower their costs through a competitive tendering process among ems providers 
this process creates an opportunity to increase revenue to the extent we are successful in the tender process  however there is also the potential for revenue decline to the extent we are unsuccessful in this process 
furthermore  even if we are successful  there is potential for our margins to decline 
if we lose any of our larger product lines manufactured for any one of our customers  we could experience declines in revenue 
gross profit gross profit decreased million from million  or of revenue  for fiscal year  to million  or of revenue  for fiscal year the decline in gross profit in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue is due partially to a net recovery of restructuring and other charges of million recorded in fiscal year  including net proceeds of million  or of revenue for fiscal year  related to the settlement of a legal claim for obsolete inventory previously written off and an other charge of million  or of revenue for fiscal year  related to a provision against inventory caused by an unanticipated volume decline from a major customer that operates in a cyclical sector offset by the recovery of a previously recorded other charge of million  or of revenue for fiscal year the decline in gross profit absolute dollars is also due to the lower sales base in fiscal year coupled with a change in customer mix  partially offset by improved utilization of fixed costs 
the decline in the gross profit as a percentage of revenue is also due to a change in customer mix and higher variable costs as a percentage of revenue  partially offset by improved utilization of fixed costs 
the company adjusts for estimated obsolete or excess inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated realizable value based upon customer forecasts  shrinkage  the aging and future demand of the inventory  past experience with specific customers and the ability to sell back inventory to customers or suppliers 
if these estimates change  additional write downs may be required 
selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million from million  or of revenue  for fiscal year to million  or of revenue  for fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year include an adjustment of million related to proceeds received on the sale of an asset previously written off  offset by a provision for the settlement of a mexican labor dispute of million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue is the result of corporate wide cost containment measures 
the company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated credit losses based on the length of time the receivables have been outstanding  customer and industry concentrations  the current business environment and historical experience

in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  change of control limitations  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
as a result of the quarterly reviews undertaken at the end of the second quarter of  the company concluded that given the weakness and uncertainty in the economic environment at that time  it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from its operations in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
in fiscal years and  it was determined by management that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with the mexican jurisdiction would be realized in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the us and canadian jurisdictions continued to have a full valuation allowance established for the deferred tax asset 
in addition  the company expects to continue to provide a full valuation allowance for the assets relating to the u 
s and canadian jurisdictions until it can demonstrate a sustained level of profitability that establishes its ability to utilize the assets in the jurisdictions to which the assets relate 
at december   the company had total net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million million  of which million will expire in  million will expire in  million will expire in  million will expire in  will expire in  million will expire in and million will expire in whether or not the recapitalization transaction results in an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code section  which imposes a limitation on a corporation s use of net operating loss nol carryforwards following an ownership change  depends upon whether the exchangeable shares of smtc canada are treated as shares of the company under us tax principles 
the tax law governing the exchangeable shares is unclear 
accordingly  it is uncertain whether section will apply to the recapitalization transaction 
if deemed applicable  section would limit the amount of nols available to offset taxable income in the post ownership change period and would preclude the full utilization of the company s nols 
however  the company filed the appropriate tax election to ensure that the taxable intercompany dividend referred to above would be allocated to the pre ownership change period in the year ended december   and thus the utilization of nols against this income amount would not be limited 
taxes related to income from discontinued operations were offset against tax loss carryforwards 
discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations during fiscal year consists primarily of proceeds from the settlement of a lawsuit of million and an adjustment to the remaining accrual for closing costs of million  both relating to the closure of the appleton manufacturing facility  and proceeds from the liquidation of the cork  ireland facility of million

interest expense interest expense decreased million from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year interest expense for the fiscal year includes the amortization of deferred financing fees of million offset by a reduction in interest expense of million related to the amortization of the value of the cancelled warrants 
excluding the amortization of deferred financing fees and the reduction in interest expense related to the amortization of the value of the cancelled warrants  interest expense decreased million from million to million due to lower average debt balances outstanding during fiscal year the weighted average interest rates with respect to the debt for the years ended december  and december  were and  respectively 
income tax expense the net tax expense for fiscal year of million includes million related to minimum tax on an intercompany dividend  million related to taxes in certain jurisdictions offset by a deferred tax asset associated with the mexican jurisdiction 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  change of control limitations  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
as a result of the quarterly review undertaken at the end of the second quarter of  the company concluded that given the weakness and uncertainty in the economic environment at that time  it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from its operations in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
in  it was determined by management that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets associated with the mexican jurisdiction would be realized in the amount of million 
the us and canadian jurisdictions continued to have a full valuation allowance established for the deferred tax asset 
in addition  the company expects to continue to provide a full valuation allowance for the assets relating to the u 
s and canadian jurisdictions until it can demonstrate a sustained level of profitability that establishes its ability to utilize the assets in the jurisdictions to which the assets relate 
at december   the company had total net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million million  of which million will expire in  million will expire in  million will expire in  million will expire in  million will expire in and  million will expire in  million will expire in  and million will expire in during the quarter ended july   the company incurred tax on an intercompany dividend payment  of which approximately million was offset against tax loss carryforwards 
this had the effect of reducing the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance by the same amount 
the company recorded a tax expense of million related to minimum tax on this dividend 
whether or not the recapitalization transaction resulted in an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code section  which imposes a limitation on a corporation s use of net operating loss nol carryforwards following an ownership change  depends upon whether the exchangeable shares of smtc canada are treated as shares of the company under us tax principles 
the tax law governing the exchangeable shares is unclear 
accordingly  it is uncertain whether section will apply to the recapitalization transaction 
if deemed applicable  section would limit the amount of nols available to offset taxable income in the post ownership change period and would preclude the full utilization of the company s nols 
however  the company would file the appropriate tax election to ensure that the taxable intercompany dividend referred to above would be allocated to the pre ownership change period in the year ended december   and thus the utilization of nols against this income amount would not be limited 
taxes related to income from discontinued operations were offset against tax loss carryforwards

the net generation of working capital of million consists of an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income tax payable of million and million  respectively  both of which used working capital 
this was offset by a decrease in inventory of million and a net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  both of which generated working capital

inventory turned  on an annualized basis  six times for both fiscal year and fiscal year accounts payable days outstanding was days for the fourth quarter of compared to days for the same period last year

capital resources as described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  in  the company effected a recapitalization transaction through three main components a private placement of equity securities  a transaction with our pre existing lenders to repay a portion of and restructure a portion of the company s existing debt and a new secured credit facility 
on march   we closed in escrow a fully underwritten  committed private placement of  special warrants of smtc canada to qualified investors at a price of c approximately us per special warrant  representing an aggregate amount of issue of c million  c million net of underwriting expenses  or approximately us million  us million net of underwriting expenses  based on the exchange rate on march  the net proceeds were released from escrow on june  and were used for debt reduction and working capital 
we satisfied debt that was owed to the pre existing lenders by repaying million of debt at par  exchanging million of debt for million of the company s common stock and warrants valued on the same terms as the private placement  and converting million of debt into second lien subordinated debt with maturity ranging from four to five years 
we obtained a new  year million credit facility  subject to certain borrowing base conditions  from wachovia 
the wachovia credit facility includes the following terms the borrowing base for the revolving loan facilities provided by wachovia is calculated using a formula based on i the lesser of of the value of the eligible inventory of the company s us and canadian operating entities valued at the lower of cost or market value  or of such inventory s appraised value  both subject to a million cap and ii of the eligible accounts receivable of those entities 
the revolving loan facility originally required a lock box arrangement where all customer remittances were swept daily to reduce the borrowings outstanding 
the wachovia credit facility includes a single financial covenant that requires the company to maintain a specified level of consolidated ebitda and subjective acceleration clauses which would allow wachovia to forego additional advances should it determine certain conditions exist  including those resulting in a material adverse change of the company s business  assets  operations  prospects or financial condition 
the company was required to achieve consolidated ebitda of million cumulatively for the first two quarters of  million cumulatively for the first three quarters of  which the company achieved  and million cumulatively for in total 
in march  the company and wachovia signed an amendment to the wachovia credit facility the march amendment which amended the ebitda covenant for the year ended december  to million  and on a consolidated rolling four quarter basis  amended the ebitda covenant for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year to million  million  million and million  respectively 
thereafter  the company is required to maintain consolidated ebitda of million on a rolling four quarter basis 
the wachovia credit facility is secured by the current and future assets of the company s us and canadian operations 
the security interest granted to wachovia ranks senior to any security interest of the pre existing lenders 
the wachovia credit facility includes representations  warranties  covenants and events of default that are customary for asset based credit facilities 
the recapitalization transaction lowered our overall indebtedness by approximately million  extended the term of the majority of the remaining indebtedness and provided additional liquidity 
the level of indebtedness under our credit facility at may   just prior to the recapitalization transaction  was million 
immediately following the closing of the recapitalization transaction on june   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facilities 
during the period from november and august  the company  together with wachovia executed amendments to the wachovia credit facility reducing the ebitda targets for the quarters ended december  to december  and allowing the company to elect to use a springing lock box arrangement  whereby remittances from customers would be forwarded to the company s general bank account rather than the lock box arrangement as previously required 
also during this period the company executed an amendment to the subordinated debt facility  which reduced the ebitda targets for each of the four quarters in the year ending december  in august  we signed a further amendment to the wachovia facilities which removed the elimination of inventory from the availability calculation should the company elect to change to the springing lock box arrangement 
we believe that no conditions have occurred that would result in subjective acceleration by the lenders  nor do we believe that any such conditions will exist over the next months 
furthermore  wachovia has not informed us that any such condition or event has occurred 
because of the option to use a springing lock box arrangement and based on our assessment of the subjective acceleration clauses  the debt has been classified is classified as long term as at december  at december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding under the wachovia credit facility and term debt  million of subordinated debt and million related to the unamortized value of the cancelled warrants related to the pre existing facility 
we do not foresee being precluded from exercising the option of converting to a springing lock box based on our expected financing needs over the next months  however  due to the effective cash management aspect of the current lock box arrangement  we have no plans to move to a springing lock box arrangement 
we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs at our current level of operations and organic growth through the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard  particularly with respect to amounts available under our credit facilities 
we have agreed to a borrowing base formula under which the amount we are permitted to borrow under the wachovia credit facility is based on our accounts receivable and inventory 
further  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness 
our future operating performance and ability to service or refinance indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
as at december   contractual repayments due within each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows in millions contractual obligations thereafter total senior debt revolving senior debt term subordinated debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to the principal repayments in the table above  the company is obligated to pay million of payment in kind interest over the remaining term of the subordinated debt in connection with the tranche b term loan 
included in the operating lease obligations are million representing lease costs for  which has been recorded as part of the restructuring charges and accrued in the consolidated financial statements at december  in the normal course of business  we may be subject to litigation and claims from customers  suppliers and former employees 
we believe that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts  where required 
although it is not possible to estimate the extent of potential costs  if any  management believes that ultimate resolution of such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company is in compliance with the financial covenants included in its lending agreements at december  continued compliance with the financial covenants through the next twelve months is dependent on the company achieving certain forecasts 
the company believes the forecasts are based on reasonable assumptions and are achievable  however  the forecasts are dependent on a number of factors  some of which are outside the control of the company 
these include but are not limited to  general economic conditions and specifically the strength of the electronics industry and the related demand for products and services by the company s customers 
in the event of non compliance  the company s lenders have the ability to demand repayment of the amounts outstanding under the lending agreements  pursue other remedies or  if the company can reach an agreement with its lenders  amend the financial covenants 
in march  we executed an amendment to the subordinated debt agreement  which reduced the ebitda targets for each of the four quarters in the year ending december  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on its results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion sfas 
accounting principles board opinion apb is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets generally should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
sfas amends apb to eliminate the exception from fair value measurement for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the standard is effective for non monetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  and will be applied prospectively 
the company does not expect that this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r share based payments sfas r 
the new statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  sfas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
as required by sfas r  the company will be required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and compensatory employee stock purchase plans 
the new rules will be effective for the company beginning january  the company is currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of the evolving accounting standards related to share based payments and also the impact of other aspects of sfas r  including transitional adoption alternatives 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas r 
sab contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions 
the company is currently evaluating sab and will be incorporating it as part of its adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to do so 
in addition  sfas requires that a change in depreciation method be accounted for as a change in estimate  not as a change in accounting principle as previously required by apb however  a change in depreciation methods must continue to be justified by its preferability and related disclosures must be provided 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following critical accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable and record an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reduces the accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
a specific allowance is recorded against customer accounts receivable that are considered to be impaired based on our knowledge of the financial condition of our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider factors  including the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding  customer and industry concentrations  the current business environment and historical experience 
inventory valuation inventories are valued  on a first in  first out basis  at the lower of cost and replacement cost for raw materials and at the lower of cost and net realizable value for work in progress and finished goods 
inventories include an application of relevant overhead 
we write down estimated obsolete or excess inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value based upon customer forecasts  shrinkage  the aging and future demand of the inventory  past experience with specific customers  and the ability to sell inventory to customers or on return to suppliers 
if these assumptions change  additional write downs may be required 
restructuring and other charges in response to excess capacity  we have recorded restructuring and other charges aimed at reducing our cost structure 
in connection with exit activities  we have recorded charges for inventory write downs  employee termination costs  lease and other contractual obligations  long lived asset impairment and other exit related costs 
these charges were incurred pursuant to formal plans developed by management 
the recognition of restructuring and other charges required us to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activities 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring the recording of additional charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provision are for their intended purposed in accordance with the developed exit plans 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement 
under statement assets must be classified as either held for use or available for sale 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset that is held and used exceeds the projected undiscounted future net cash flows expected from its use and disposal  and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is measured by discounted cash flows when quoted market prices are not available 
for assets available for sale  an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
in accordance with the provisions of statement  we have presented the closure of our cork facility in and sale of our appleton facility in as discontinued operations 
income tax valuation allowance in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  change of control limitations  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
based upon consideration of these factors  management believes the recorded valuation allowance related to all of its loss carryforwards is appropriate 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our credit facilities bear interest at both floating and fixed rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our credit facilities for the quarter ended december  was 
at december   our revolving credit facility of million bore interest at based on the us prime rate and our tranche a term debt bore interest at based on the us base rate 
if the us base rates increased by  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million annually 
foreign currency exchange risk most of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
most of our purchases are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of canadian and mexican payroll and other various expenses denominated in local currencies 
as a result we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
