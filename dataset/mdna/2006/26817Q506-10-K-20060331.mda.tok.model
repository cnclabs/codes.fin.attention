item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary dynex capital  inc  together with its subsidiaries  is a specialty finance company organized as a real estate investment trust reit that invests in loans and securities consisting principally of single family residential and commercial mortgage loans 
we finance these loans and securities through a combination of non recourse securitization financing  repurchase agreements  and equity 
we employ leverage in order to increase the overall yield on our invested capital 
we seek to generate net interest income ie  interest income on investments in excess of the cost of financing these assets  which provide acceptable returns on our invested capital on a risk adjusted basis 
in recent years  we have elected to sell certain non core assets  including investments in manufactured housing loans and delinquent property tax receivable portfolios 
our emphasis has been on monetizing underperforming assets in anticipation of redeploying the invested capital in more compelling investment opportunities 
given the flat treasury yield curve  however  and the challenging reinvestment environment in traditional mortgage reit investment opportunities  we have retained our capital in anticipation of more compelling investment opportunities in the future 
we believe our strategy of retaining capital in the face of increases in interest rates by the federal reserve of since june has protected shareholder value 
we have an investment policy which governs the allocation of capital amongst short term  highly liquid investments  investment grade fixed income investments  subordinate and credit sensitive investments  and strategic investments 
strategic investments are investments in equity and equity like securities of other companies  including other mortgage reits 
we anticipate in making additional strategic investments while using our capital in the interim to pay down recourse debt or to invest only in short term  highly liquid investments 
during  we earned net income of million  and net income to our common shareholders of million 
because of differences in gaap income and taxable income  we expect to report a tax loss but have not completed our tax calculation 
accordingly  we did not pay a dividend on the common shares outstanding and will increase our nol carryforward  which was million as of december  during  we continued the process of monetizing under performing and non core investments 
these investments sold had a carrying value of million  and we recorded net gains of million  while derecognizing or repaying associated financing liabilities of million 
we also had paydowns of investments of million which were utilized to repay the associated financing liabilities of million 
during  we redeemed all of the bonds issued by one of our securitization trusts  financing the acquisition of these bonds with repurchase agreements 
we have kept the securitization financing bonds outstanding and pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements 
at december   the bonds had an outstanding principal balance of million  and the associated repurchase agreement financing had an outstanding balance of million 
financial condition comparative balance sheet information is set forth in the tables below december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments securitized finance receivables loans  net debt securities securities other investments other loans non recourse securitization financing repurchase agreements secured by securitization financing bonds repurchase agreements secured by securities shareholders equity book value per common share inclusive of preferred stock liquidation preference securitized finance receivables securitized finance receivables include loans and securities consisting of or secured by principally single family residential and commercial mortgage loans 
securitized finance receivables decreased to million at december  from  million at december  this decrease of million is primarily the result of sales and derecognition of million of receivables  and principal repayments of million 
principal repayments resulted from normal principal amortization of the underlying loan or security  and higher than anticipated prepayments on these assets due to the favorable interest rate and real estate environment  leading to refinances of the underlying mortgages or sales of the underlying properties 
in addition to the above  allowance for loan losses  primarily on delinquent commercial mortgage loans was increased by a net million during the year 
securities securities are predominantly investment grade single family residential mortgage securities 
securities at december  include investment grade rated securities of million  and non investment grade rated securities of million  including equity securities 
securities decreased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily as a result of principal payments of million on investment grade securities during the year  net sales of million of equity securities and a million net decrease in market value of available for sale securities 
these increases were partially offset by the purchase of million of investment grade single family residential securities 
other investments other investments at december  and consist primarily of delinquent property tax receivables  a security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables  and the associated real estate owned 
other investments decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million resulted from payments of million collected in and applied against the carrying value of the investment  million in net proceeds from sales of related real estate owned  a million other than temporary impairment charge and losses on sales of reo properties of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases related to advances made in the foreclosure of property tax receivables of million and interest accretion of million 
non recourse securitization financing non recourse securitization financing decreased to million at december  from  million at december  this decrease was primarily a result of principal payments received of million on the associated collateral pledged which were used to pay down the securitization financing in accordance with the respective indentures  the derecognition of million of non recourse securitization financing as a result of the sale of the associated securitized finance receivables as described above  and a redemption of million of certain outstanding bonds issued by us 
the decrease also reflects a million decline in accrued interest payable and an increase of million related to the amortization of bond discounts and issuance costs during the year 
repurchase agreements secured by securitization financing bonds in april  we redeemed million of outstanding securitization financing bonds as discussed above  utilizing cash on hand of million and million in repurchase agreements to finance the purchase 
the bonds continue to remain outstanding and serve as collateral for the repurchase agreement borrowings 
during  payments of million received on the bonds were used to paydown the repurchase agreement borrowings to their current balance of million at december  repurchase agreements secured by securities repurchase agreements decreased from million at december  to million at december  resulting from million of repayments 
shareholders equity shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase of million resulted from net income of million  offset by a change in accumulated other comprehensive income of million consisting of million from the sale of certain available for sale investments  an increase of million on interest rate swap and synthetic interest rate swap contracts from the realization of losses on settled contracts and deferred gains on the remaining hedge contracts  and by dividends declared and paid on shares of series d preferred stock of million 
supplemental discussion of investments we also manage our investment portfolio based on a net basis 
below is the net basis of our investments as of december  and excluded from this table are cash and cash equivalents  other assets  and other liabilities 
as the cash flows received on our investments is generally subordinate to the obligations under the associated financing of the investment  we evaluate and manage our investment portfolio based on our net capital invested in that particular investment 
net capital invested is generally defined as the cost basis of the investment net of the associated financing for that investment 
for securitized finance receivables  because the securitization financing is recourse only to the finance receivables pledged and is  therefore  not our general obligation  the risk on our investment in securitized finance receivables from an economic point of view is limited to our net retained investment in the securitization trust 
below is the net basis of our investments as of december  and included in the table is an estimate of the fair value of the our net investment 
the fair value of our net investment in securitized finance receivables is based on the present value of the projected cash flow from the collateral  adjusted for the impact and assumed level of future prepayments and credit losses  less the projected principal and interest due on the securitization financing bonds owned by third parties 
the fair value of securities is based on quotes obtained from third party dealers  or from management estimates 
amounts in thousands december  amortized cost basis financing net basis fair value of net basis securitized finance receivables single family mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans manufactured housing loans allowance for loan losses securities investment grade single family non investment grade single family equity and other other loans and investments total fair values are based on dealer quotes  where dealer quotes are not available fair values are calculated as the net present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at 
fair value also includes our capital invested in redeemed securitization financing bonds 
expected cash flows were based on the forward libor curve as of december   and incorporate the resetting of the interest rates on the adjustable rate assets to a level consistent with projected prevailing rates 
increases or decreases in interest rates and index levels from those used would impact the calculation of fair value  as would differences in actual prepayment speeds and credit losses versus the assumptions set forth above 
amounts in thousands december  carrying value financing net basis fair value of net basis securitized finance receivables single family mortgage loans commercial mortgage loans manufactured housing loans allowance for loan losses securities investment grade single family non investment grade single family other loans and investments total calculated as the net present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at

increases or decreases in interest rates and index levels from those used would impact the calculation of fair value  as would differences in actual prepayment speeds and credit losses versus the assumptions set forth above 
our net investment for increased versus as a result of the sale and derecognition of securitized finance receivables  the redemption of the securitization financing associated with the single family mortgage loans which was financed with a combination of investable capital and repurchase financing  the repayment of repurchase agreement financing on our securities portfolio  and the sale of certain equity investments 
the repayment of repurchase agreement financing was for liquidity management purposes  and we expect to be able to borrow these amounts in the future if necessary 
the following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating fair value for our net investment in securitized finance receivables and the cash flow related to those net investments during fair value assumptions in thousands loan type weighted average prepayment speeds losses weighted average discount rate projected cash flow termination date cash flows received in single family mortgage loans cpr annually anticipated final maturity commercial mortgage loans annually represents the excess of the cash flows received on the collateral pledged over the cash flow requirements of the securitization financing bond security 
includes loans pledged to three different securitization trusts 
assumed cpr speeds generally are governed by underlying pool characteristics  prepayment lock out provisions  and yield maintenance provisions 
loans currently delinquent in excess of days are assumed liquidated in month six 
cash flow termination dates are modeled based on the repayment dates of the loans or optional redemption dates of the underlying securitization financing bonds 
results of operations comparative information on our results of operations is provided in the tables below for the year ended december  amounts in thousands except per share information net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses impairment charges gain on sales of investments other income expense general and administrative expenses net income loss preferred stock charge benefit net income loss to common shareholders basic diluted net income loss per common share dividends declared per share common series a and b preferred series c preferred series d preferred compared to net income increased in by million  to million in from a loss of million in  as a result of a decrease in provision for loan losses of million  decreased impairment charges of million  decreased general and administrative expenses of million and million of other income 
these increases in income were partially offset by a decrease of net interest income of million and a decrease in gain on sales of investments of million 
net income to common shareholders increased by million in  from a loss of million in to income of million in the increase in net income to common shareholders was due to increased net income of million  offset by an increase in preferred stock charges of million 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in net interest income decreased million  or  as a result of a decline in average interest earning assets and a decrease in the net interest spread on interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets decreased in due to the sale of investments  including million of securitized finance receivables  million of equity securities and million of other loans 
net interest spread was in versus in  and decreased in as a result of sales and prepayments of higher coupon assets  the proceeds of which have been reinvested in lower yielding cash equivalents  and also decreased due in part to increasing borrowing costs from both increasing libor rates and repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
see further discussion below as to changes in the net interest spread on our investment portfolio during net interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of the decline of the provision for loan losses in compared to of million 
provision for loan losses decreased to million in  from million in the decrease of million from was primarily due to the sale in late and early of our investment in manufactured housing loans 
provision for manufactured housing loan losses decreased by million in while commercial and single family loan loss reserve provisions increased by million and million  respectively 
impairment charges decreased from million in to million in impairment charges for included million on manufactured housing loan securities and million on delinquent property tax receivable securities 
no impairment charges were recorded on manufactured housing securities as a result of their sale in impairment charges in included million on a debt security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables 
gain on sale of investments for resulted primarily from a net gain of million recognized on the sale of our interests in securitization trusts collateralized primarily by manufactured housing loans and securities backed by manufactured housing loans  for cash proceeds of million 
the sale of our interests in those securitizations resulted in the derecognition of approximately million of securitized finance receivables and million of related securitization financing 
we also recorded a gain of million on the sale of approximately million in mezzanine loans for net proceeds of million 
general and administrative expense decreased by million from million to million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased during with the sale in october of the ohio delinquent property tax receivable servicing operation and through continued downsizing in the operation 
general and administrative expenses in included million of litigation related expenses versus million in general and administrative expenses in included approximately increase in professional fees related to the audit of our financial statements and the subsequent termination of our independent accounting firm 
we reported a preferred stock charge of million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million from the million reported for the year ended december  preferred stock charge for includes a full year s dividend on the series d preferred stock 
in  dividends on the preferred stock outstanding was partially offset by the preferred stock benefit resulting from the recapitalization completed in compared to net loss decreased in by million  to million in from a loss of million in  as a result of an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses of million and an increase in gain on sales of investments of million 
net loss to common shareholders decreased by million in  from million in to million in the improvement in net loss to common shareholders was due to reduced net loss of million  offset by the reduction in preferred stock benefit of million 
the preferred stock benefit in resulted from the effects of a tender offer on the outstanding preferred stock completed in as compared to the net effect of the recapitalization of the preferred stock in and preferred stock dividends 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the same period in net interest income decreased million  or  as a result of a decline in average interest earning assets and a decrease in the net interest spread on interest earning assets 
net interest spread decreased in as a result of prepayments of higher coupon assets  the proceeds of which have been reinvested in lower yielding cash equivalents  and also decreased due in part to increasing borrowing costs from both increasing libor rates and repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
see further discussion below as to changes in the net interest spread on our investment portfolio during net interest income after provision for loan losses increased as a result of the decline of the provision for loan losses in compared to of million 
provision for loan losses decreased to million in  from million in the decrease of million from was primarily due to million of provision for loan losses recorded during the second quarter of specifically for currently existing credit losses within outstanding manufactured housing loans that were current as to payment but which we had determined to be impaired 
the remaining million of the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the estimated losses on commercial and manufactured housing loans 
impairment charges decreased from million in to million in impairment charges in included million on a debt security collateralized by manufactured housing loans and million on a debt security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables 
other than temporary impairment charges were recorded as a result of the carrying value of the debt securities referenced above exceeded their estimated fair value and we determined that the carrying value would likely exceed the fair value for the foreseeable future 
impairment charges for included million on manufactured housing loan securities and million on delinquent property tax receivable securities 
gain on sale of investments for included a million gain from the sale of securitized finance receivables with a carrying value of million  net of allowance for loan losses of million  and the de recognition of the associated securitization financing bonds with a carrying amount of million 
we received a net million in proceeds from the sale of these receivables 
this gain was partially offset by a million loss on the sale of our ohio delinquent property tax receivable investment 
we reported a preferred stock charge of million for the year ended december   which represents a decline of million from the preferred stock benefit of million reported for the year ended december  this decrease in the preferred stock charge benefit was due to the recapitalization completed in and the tender offer completed in described in more detail above 
average balances and effective interest rates the following table summarizes the average balances of interest earning assets and their average effective yields  along with the average interest bearing liabilities and the related average effective interest rates  for each of the periods presented

average balances exclude funds held by trustees of   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
effective rates are calculated excluding non interest related non recourse securitization financing expenses and provision for credit losses 
compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to basis points from basis points for the year ended december  this decrease in the net interest spread is due to declining yields on interest earning assets  due principally to decreased interest income as a result of the sale of approximately million of securitized finance receivables during the second quarter of and the sale of approximately million in receivables during the fourth quarter of the net interest spread contribution for the receivables sold was basis points and basis points for the three and twelve month periods ended december  and basis points and basis points  respectively during the three and twelve month periods ended december  the proceeds from the sale of these investments have generally been invested in cash and short term securities 
in addition during  the securitization financing that backed variable rate single family loans was replaced with libor based repurchase agreement financing  which is recourse to us  and which carries a weighted average spread to libor of basis points 
the securitization financing had an effective spread to libor of basis points 
the net interest spread reflects the reduce yield on increased investments in cash and cash equivalents and also reflects the amortization of premiums and discounts on both the assets and the liabilities 
the overall yield on interest earnings assets  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the overall yield declined by basis points as higher rate loans continued to be prepaid during the period 
in addition to declining asset yields  interest bearing liability costs increased from to as a result of the overall increase in market interest rates  including libor rates  and the repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
approximately of our interest bearing liabilities re price monthly and are indexed to one month libor  which averaged for  compared to for compared to the net interest spread for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december  this decrease can be generally attributed to the prepayment of higher coupon investments  principally securitized finance receivables  and the resulting reinvestment of net proceeds available as a result of these prepayments into lower yielding cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  net interest spread declined approximately from the non accrual status of a delinquent property tax receivable in compared to  and declined approximately as a result of net asset premium and bond discount amortization expense from the unexpected prepayment of approximately million in commercial mortgage loans during the overall yield on interest earnings assets  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the overall yield declined by as a result of the non accrual status in of a delinquent property tax receivable security  with the balance of the decline due to the prepayment of higher coupon investments 
in addition to declining asset yields  interest bearing liability costs increased from to as a result of the overall increase in market interest rates  including libor rates  and the repayment of lower cost securitization financing bonds pursuant to the terms of the securitization trust 
approximately of our interest bearing liabilities re price monthly and are indexed to one month libor  which averaged for  compared to for in addition  interest bearing liability costs increased by approximately a net for bond discount amortization resulting from the prepayment of approximately million of securitization financing related to commercial loans which prepaid during the year

this table excludes non interest related securitization financing expense  other interest expense and provision for credit losses 
credit exposures as discussed in item above  our predominate securitization structure is non recourse securitization financing  whereby loans and securities are pledged to a trust  and the trust issues bonds pursuant to an indenture 
generally  these securitization structures use over collateralization  subordination  third party guarantees  reserve funds  bond insurance  mortgage pool insurance or any combination of the foregoing as a form of credit enhancement 
from an economic point of view  we generally have retained a limited portion of the direct credit risk in these structures 
in many instances  we retained the first loss credit risk on pools of loans and securities that we have securitized 
apart from these investments  we have not otherwise retained material amounts of credit risk 
the following table summarizes the aggregate principal amount of our investments in securitized finance receivables and subordinate securities  the direct credit exposure retained by us from those investments represented by the amount of over collateralization pledged and subordinated securities owned by us  net of the credit reserves and discounts maintained by us for such exposure  and the actual credit losses incurred for each year 
our credit exposure  net of credit reserves has sequentially decreased from year to year as a result of the sale and derecognition of investments  and as a result of additional provisions for loan losses on loans where we have credit risk 
from to  we sold or assets were otherwise paid down by  million  resulting in the reduction of our credit risk by million 
credit reserves and actual credit losses in millions outstanding loan principal balance credit exposure  net of credit reserves actual credit losses credit exposure  net of credit reserves to outstanding loan balance the following tables summarize single family mortgage loan and commercial mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding commercial securitized finance receivables balance for those securities in which we have retained a portion of the direct credit risk 
the delinquencies as a percentage of all outstanding securitized finance receivables balance have decreased to at december  from at december  primarily as a result of certain commercial loans that were delinquent in being paid off during and the continued strong performance of the residential real estate market 
we monitor and evaluate our exposure to credit losses and have established reserves based upon anticipated losses  general economic conditions and trends in the investment portfolio 
at december   management believes the level of credit reserves is appropriate for currently existing losses 
single family mortgage loan delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding loan balance decreased by approximately to at december  from at december  the decline in delinquencies is primarily due to the continued strong performance of the residential real estate market during the the following table provides the percentage of delinquent single family loans at december   and  respectively 
single family loan delinquency statistics december  to days delinquent to days delinquent days and over delinquent total for commercial mortgage loans  the delinquencies as a percentage of the outstanding securitized finance receivables balance have decreased to at december  from at december  primarily due to five commercial loans which prepaid during  which was partially offset by two loans that became delinquent in commercial mortgage loan delinquency statistics december  to days delinquent to days delinquent days and over delinquent total includes foreclosures and real estate owned 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or the application of which may have a material impact on our financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
consolidation of subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements represent our accounts after the elimination of inter company transactions 
we consolidate entities in which we own more than of the voting equity and control of the entity does not rest with others 
we follow the equity method of accounting for investments with greater than and less than a interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures or when we are able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee but own less than of the voting equity 
for all other investments  the cost method is applied 
impairments 
we evaluate all securities in our investment portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
a security is generally defined to be other than temporarily impaired if  for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters  the carrying value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and we estimate  based on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants  that the fair value will remain below the carrying value for the foreseeable future 
if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist  we record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its estimated fair value 
in certain instances  as a result of the other than temporary impairment analysis  the recognition or accrual of interest will be discontinued and the security will be placed on non accrual status 
we consider an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its recorded cost basis 
impairments of other investments are generally considered to be other than temporary when the fair value remains below the carrying value for three consecutive quarters 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded in order to adjust the carrying value of the investment to its estimated value 
allowance for loan losses 
we have credit risk on loans pledged in securitization financing transactions and classified as securitized finance receivables in our investment portfolio 
an allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently existing probable losses 
factors considered in establishing an allowance include current loan delinquencies  historical cure rates of delinquent loans  and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are liquidated 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and estimated timing and amount of probable credit losses  using the above factors  as well as industry loss experience 
where loans are considered homogeneous  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a pool basis 
otherwise  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan specific basis 
provisions made to increase the allowance are a current period expense to operations 
single family loans are considered impaired when they are days past due 
commercial mortgage loans are evaluated on an individual basis for impairment 
generally  a commercial loan with a debt service coverage ratio of less than one is considered impaired 
however  based on a commercial loan s details  commercial loans with a debt service ratio less than one may not be considered impaired  conversely  commercial loans with a debt service coverage ratio greater than one may be considered impaired 
certain of the commercial mortgage loans are covered by loan guarantees that limit our exposure on these loans 
the level of allowance for loan losses required for these loans is reduced by the amount of applicable loan guarantees 
our actual credit losses may differ from the estimates used to establish the allowance 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a variety of sources 
our primary source of funding for our operations today is the cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  which includes net interest income and principal payments and prepayments on these investments 
from the cash flow on our investment portfolio  we fund our operating overhead costs  including the servicing of our delinquent property tax receivables  pay the dividend on the series d preferred stock and service the remaining recourse debt 
our investment portfolio continues to provide positive cash flow  which can be utilized by us for reinvestment or other purposes 
we have utilized our cash flow to repay recourse debt outstanding and to purchase loans and securities for our investment portfolio 
the cash flow from our investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively  excluding proceeds from the sales of investments and the above refunding of repurchase agreements 
such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on the associated non recourse securitization financing ie  non recourse debt outstanding 
we also sold investments in which generated net cash proceeds of million 
excluding any cash flow derived from the sale or re securitization of assets  and assuming that short term interest rates remain stable  we anticipate that the cash flow from our investment portfolio will continue to decline in compared to as the investment portfolio continues to pay down absent reinvestment of our capital 
we anticipate  however  that we will have sufficient cash flow from our investment portfolio to meet all of our obligations on both a short term and long term basis 
our cash flow from our investment portfolio is subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses 
we currently have a substantial portion of our available capital invested in cash or highly liquid  short term instruments 
at december   this amount was million  which represents a significant portion of our overall equity capital base 
we intend to maintain high levels of liquidity for the foreseeable future given the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities as a result of the absolute low level of interest rates  the flat yield curve  and the historically tight spreads on fixed income instruments 
we redeemed of our series d preferred stock in january this redemption reduced the series d preferred stock outstanding by approximately million  saving us approximately million in dividends annually 
the board of directors of dynex also approved the redemption of up to one million shares of common stock of dynex upon completion of the redemption of the series d preferred stock 
the redemption of any shares of common stock is likely to occur if alternative uses of the capital are not available and if accretive to book value per common share 
upon completion of the redemption of the preferred stock  we will have an estimated million in remaining investable capital 
through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  we have issued non recourse debt in the form of non recourse securitization financing to fund the majority of our investment portfolio 
the obligations under the securitization financing are payable solely from the securitized finance receivables and are otherwise non recourse to us 
the maturity of each class of securitization financing is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral and is not subject to margin call risk 
each series is also subject to redemption according to specific terms of the respective indentures  generally on the earlier of a specified date or when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds 
at december   we have million of non recourse securitization financing outstanding  all of which carries a fixed rate of interest 
we redeemed approximately million of securitization financing in the second quarter of  financing the redemption of the bonds outstanding with cash of million and repurchase agreement financing of million 
as a result of paydowns on the associated securitized finance receivables  the remaining balance of the securitization financing bonds at the end of was million 
we were financing the remaining million with cash of million and repurchase agreement financing of approximately million 
as the redeemed bonds have not been legally extinguished  we could reissue these bonds  generating estimated proceeds in excess of million  which would be used to repay the repurchase agreement financing  and the balance of which would increase our cash and cash equivalents 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table shows expected cash payments on our contractual obligations as of december  for the following time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations non recourse securitization financing repurchase agreements operating lease obligations mortgage servicing obligations total as the master servicer for certain of the series of non recourse securitization financing securities which we have issued  and certain loans which have been securitized but for which we are not the master servicer  we have an obligation to advance scheduled principal and interest on delinquent loans in accordance with the underlying servicing agreements should the primary servicer fail to make such advance 
such advance amounts are generally repaid in the same month as they are made  or shortly thereafter  and the contractual obligation with respect to these advances is excluded from the above table 
amounts presented for long term debt obligations include estimated principal and interest on the related obligations 
securitization financing is non recourse to us as the bonds are payable solely from loans and securities pledged as securitized finance receivables 
payments due by period were estimated based on the principal repayments forecast for the underlying loans and securities  substantially all of which is used to repay the associated securitization financing outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not believe that any off balance sheet arrangements exist that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

the increase in net income during the second quarter of relates primarily to the gain of approximately million recognized on the sale of million of manufactured housing loans and securities and the derecognition of the related non recourse securitization financing of million 
the negative net interest spread on interest earning assets resulted from the impact of certain commercial loans being on non accrual and an increase in amortization expense related to deferred costs on our commercial securitizations resulting from higher than anticipated prepayments on those securitizations

factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following reinvestment 
asset yields today are generally lower than those assets sold or repaid  due to lower overall interest rates and more competition for these assets 
we have generally been unable to find investments which have acceptable risk adjusted yields 
as a result  our net interest income has been declining  and may continue to decline in the future  resulting in lower earnings per share over time 
in order to maintain our investment portfolio size and our earnings  we need to reinvest a portion of the cash flows we receive into new interesting earning assets 
if we are unable to find suitable reinvestment opportunities  the net interest income on our investment portfolio and investment cash flows could be negatively impacted 
economic conditions 
we are affected by general economic conditions 
an increase in the risk of defaults and credit risk resulting from an economic slowdown or recession could result in a decrease in the value of our investments and the over collateralization associated with its securitization transactions 
as a result of our being heavily invested in short term high quality investments  a worsening economy  however  could also benefit us by creating opportunities for us to invest in assets that become distressed as a result of the worsening conditions 
these changes could have an effect on our financial performance and the performance on our securitized loan pools 
investment portfolio cash flow 
cash flows from the investment portfolio fund our operations  the preferred stock dividend  and repayments of outstanding debt  and are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses  particularly given the high degree of internal structural leverage inherent in our securitized investments 
based on the performance of the underlying assets within the securitization structure  cash flows which may have otherwise been paid to us as a result of our ownership interest may be retained within the structure 
cash flows from the investment portfolio are likely to sequentially decline until we meaningfully begin to reinvest our capital 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to find suitable investment alternatives for our capital  nor can there be assurances that we will meet our reinvestment and return hurdles 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from our estimates or exceed reserves for losses recorded in the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from our estimate as a result of economic conditions 
actual defaults on adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
in addition  commercial mortgage loans are generally large dollar balance loans  and a significant loan default may have an adverse impact on our financial results 
such impact may include higher provisions for loan losses and reduced interest income if the loan is placed on non accrual 
interest rate fluctuations 
our income and cash flow depends on our ability to earn greater interest on our investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by us generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
approximately million of our investments  including loans and securities currently pledged as securitized finance receivables and securities  are fixed rate and approximately million of our investments are variable rate 
we currently finance these fixed rate assets through million of fixed rate securitization financing and million of variable rate repurchase agreements 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing has no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
third party servicers 
our loans and loans underlying securities are serviced by third party service providers 
as with any external service provider  we are subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services 
many borrowers require notices and reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and foreclosures 
a substantial increase in our delinquency rate that results from improper servicing or loan performance in general could harm our ability to securitize our real estate loans in the future and may have an adverse effect on our earnings 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans we securitized may have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
our exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yielding investments 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market in which we compete with a number of institutions with greater financial resources 
in purchasing portfolio investments and in issuing securities  we compete with other mortgage reits  investment banking firms  savings and loan associations  commercial banks  mortgage bankers  insurance companies  federal agencies and other entities  many of which have greater financial resources and a lower cost of capital than we do 
increased competition in the market and our competitors greater financial resources have adversely affected dynex  and may continue to do so 
competition may also continue to keep pressure on spreads resulting in us being unable to reinvest our capital on an acceptable risk adjusted basis 
regulatory changes 
our businesses as of and for the year ended december  were not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect us and the performance of our securitized loan pools or our ability to collect on our delinquent property tax receivables 
we are a reit and are required to meet certain tests in order to maintain our reit status as described in the earlier discussion of federal income tax considerations 
if we should fail to maintain our reit status  we would not be able to hold certain investments and would be subject to income taxes 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of based on our current market capitalization  we do not anticipate that we will be required to be compliant with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of in however  the measurement date for determining the compliance deadline is june  failure to be compliant may result in doubt in the capital markets about the quality and adequacy of our internal disclosure controls 
this could result in our having difficulty in or being unable to raise additional capital in these markets in order to finance our operations and future investments 
other 
the following risks  which are discussed in more detail in risk factors in item a above  could also affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows we may be unable to invest in new assets with attractive yields  and yields on new assets in which we do invest may not generate attractive yields  resulting in a decline in our earnings per share over time 
our ownership of certain subordinate interests in securitization trusts subjects us to credit risk on the underlying loans  and we provide for loss reserves on these loans as required under gaap 
certain investments employ internal structural leverage as a result of the securitization process  and are in the most subordinate position in the capital structure  which magnifies the potential impact of adverse events on our cash flows and reported results 
our efforts to manage credit risk may not be successful in limiting delinquencies and defaults in underlying loans or losses on our investments 
prepayments of principal on our investments  and the timing of prepayments  may impact our reported earnings and our cash flows 
we finance a portion of our investment portfolio with short term recourse repurchase agreements which subjects us to margin calls if the assets pledged subsequently decline in value 
we may be subject to the risks associated with inadequate or untimely services from third party service providers  which may harm our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations can have various negative effects on us  and could lead to reduced earnings and or increased earnings volatility 
our reported income depends on accounting conventions and assumptions about the future that may change 
failure to qualify as a reit would adversely affect our dividend distributions and could adversely affect the value of our securities 
maintaining reit status may reduce our flexibility to manage our operations 
we may fail to properly conduct our operations so as to avoid falling under the definition of an investment company pursuant to the investment company act of we are dependent on certain key personnel 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
the statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the most significant change resulting from this statement is the requirement for public companies to expense employee share based payments under fair value as originally introduced in sfas no 
this statement is effective for public companies as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june   or december  for small business issuers 
we will adopt this statement effective january  and do not expect the adoption of fas r to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previous guidance required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
we do not believe sfas will have an impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
key provisions of sfas include a broad fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest only strips and principal only strips from derivative accounting under paragraph of fas thereby narrowing such exception  a requirement that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  clarification that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and elimination of the prohibition on a qspe holding passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument 
in general  these changes will reduce the operational complexity associated with bifurcating embedded derivatives  and increase the number of beneficial interests in securitization transactions  including interest only strips and principal only strips  required to be accounted for in accordance with fas we do not believe that sfas will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in march the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
this statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations and to initially measure those servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value  if practicable 
sfas permits an entity to measure each class of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities by either amortizing the servicing asset or liability and assessing the mortgage servicing asset or servicing liability for impairment at each reporting date 
alternatively  an entity may choose to measure the servicing asset or servicing liability at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the period the changes occur 
sfas permits  at its initial adoption  a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by entities with recognized servicing rights  without calling into question the treatment of other available for sale securities under statement  provided that the available for sale securities are identified in some manner as offsetting the entity s exposure to changes in fair value of servicing assets or servicing liabilities that a servicer elects to subsequently measure at fair value 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of its first fiscal year that begins after september  we are currently evaluating the potential impact this statement may have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of our market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest income comprises the primary component of our earnings and cash flows 
we are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of our interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
we monitor the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and estimated market value of our investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
we focus on the sensitivity of our investment portfolio cash flow  and measures such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
we estimate our net interest income cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the forward libor curve based on day eurodollar futures contracts as of december  once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
cash flow changes from interest rate swaps  caps  floors or any other derivative instrument are included in this analysis 
the following table summarizes our net interest income cash flow and market value sensitivity analyses as of december  these analyses represent management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow and value expressed as a percentage change of shareholders equity  given a parallel shift in interest rates  as discussed above 
other investments are excluded from this analysis because they are not considered interest rate sensitive 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   one month libor was and six month libor was 
the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting our portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to our portfolio  and no change to our liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in our investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by us 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
basis point increase decrease in interest rates projected change in net interest margin cash flow from base case projected change in value  expressed as a percentage of shareholders equity base our interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates and to the level of short term interest rates 
approximately million of our investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
approximately million of our investment portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately  and of the adjustable rate loans underlying our securitized finance receivables are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor  one year constant maturity treasury rate cmt and prime rate  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  our net interest income earned and the corresponding cash flow on our investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i fixed rate loans and investments financed with variable rate debt  ii the lag in resets of the adjustable rate loans underlying the securitized finance receivables relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings  and iii rate resets on the adjustable rate loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as to item i  we have substantially limited our interest rate risk by match funding fixed rate assets and variable rate assets 
as to items ii and iii  as short term interest rates stabilize and the adjustable rate loans reset  the net interest margin may be partially restored as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to market conditions 
net interest income may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the adjustable rate loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that we have entered into such agreements
