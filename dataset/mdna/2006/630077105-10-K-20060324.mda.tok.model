our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including those set forth in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form k could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
overview we are an innovator in the field of metrology systems for the semiconductor manufacturing industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and provide increased production yields and performance 
capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  especially in asia  and their suppliers are critical to our success 
the demand by these manufacturers and suppliers is driven by the expected market demand for new products and new applications 
the increasing complexity of the mm manufacturing processes for semiconductors is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems 
the incorporation of smaller features sizes  copper interconnect technology and optical critical dimension technology are expected to result in increased demand 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are primarily derived from product sales  which includes sales of accessories  but also from customer service for the installed base of our products 
in  we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 

table of contents important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
recently  the industry emerged from an exceptionally long  cyclical downturn 
changing trends in the semiconductor industry is increasing the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include conversion to mm wafer size 
semiconductor manufacturers are converting to mm wafers to achieve better production efficiencies 
most facilities are incorporating this wafer size  and our newest products are well positioned to serve these facilities 
it is important that we are successful in product evaluations with these new mm facilities in order to continue to gain market share 
incorporation of optical critical dimension metrology in the patterning process 
our customers use phototlithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
our proprietary optical critical dimension systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 
copper interconnect technology 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the subtractive aluminum interconnect process with copper damascene technology 
this new copper processing technology has driven the need for new metrology techniques such as non destructive laser profiling and the use of optical critical dimension ocd technology for control of the copper process 
incorporation of nm and nm feature sizes 
in an effort to reduce costs and increase device performance  semiconductor manufacturers are decreasing both the dye size and feature size 
monitoring the increased tolerance requirements on smaller features sizes requires increased use of metrology systems 
our thin film and critical dimension metrology systems are well suited and are being adopted for these next generation processes 
reduced number of customers 
because of the escalating cost of mm manufacturing facilities  fewer semiconductor manufacturers can afford the significant investment in these next generation facilities 
therefore  fewer opportunities for semiconductors equipment companies exist 
given that the available number of potential customers is decreasing  pre existing customer relationships  product positioning and critical mass take on greater importance 
adoption of new types of thin film materials 
manufacturers are adopting new processes and technologies that increase the importance and utilization of thin film metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers are utilizing copper and new  low dielectric constant low k insulating materials 
our advanced metrology solutions are required in the manufacturing process to characterize these materials 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and standalone metrology systems throughout the fab to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making 
table of contents judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue includes hardware and also software that is incidental to the products 
for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition generally occurs at the time of shipment  as our terms are fob shipping point  if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment 
all other product revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance including deemed acceptances 
in japan  where risk of loss and title transfers to the customer upon customer technical acceptance  revenue is recognized upon customer technical acceptance 
all of our products are assembled prior to shipment to our customers 
we often perform limited installation for our customers  however such installation is inconsequential and perfunctory as it is also performed by third parties 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized generally upon shipment and is included as part of service revenue 
service revenue also includes service contracts and non warranty  billable repairs of systems 
whereas service revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period under contract  service revenue related to billable repairs of systems is recognized as services are performed 
on occasion  customers request a warranty period longer than our standard month warranty 
in those instances where extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer  we follow the guidance of financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  associated revenue is deferred and recognized to income ratably over the term of the contract 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in deferred revenue 
furthermore  generally we do not provide our customers with any return rights 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer when the warranty period expires 
in limited situations we have multiple deliverables in our customer arrangements 
those situations arise with the sale of repair services and parts together 
revenues on such sales are recognized when both the services and parts have been delivered 
we also provide technical support to our customers as part of our warranty program 
upon recognition of product revenue  a liability is recorded for anticipated warranty costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our risk associated with smaller rather than larger customers and that our reported allowances are adequate 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventories we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our 
table of contents assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the age of the inventory and potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional reserves may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market value 
product warranties we sell the majority of our products with a twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of acceptance which generally represents the date of shipment 
we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to the cost of products sold 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage  labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  we may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide us in estimating our warranty accrual 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation we currently account for stock based compensation issued to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  an amendment of fasb statement no 
under the intrinsic value method  we do not recognize any compensation expense  as the exercise price of all stock options is equal to the fair market value at the time the options are granted 
we disclose the pro forma effect of recognizing compensation expense on stock options granted to employees in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
these pro forma effects are based on the fair value of the options using the black scholes valuation model using assumptions which are based on our historical experience 
our accounting treatment of stock options will significantly change in the first quarter of due to our planned adoption of sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  see recent accounting pronouncements and note below for more information

table of contents years ended december   january   and january  total net revenues 
our net revenues were comprised of the following categories years ended percentage change december  january  automated systems integrated systems tabletop systems service total net revenues years ended percentage change january  january  automated systems integrated systems tabletop systems service total net revenues in  total net revenues increased slightly to million from million in net revenues from automated systems decreased by primarily due to decreased sales of our flat panel display  or fpd  products of approximately million from see sale of flat panel display business unit  below 
decreases in fpd revenues were offset by increases in other automated stand alone systems  particularly our atlas automated metrology product as our customers continue to expand their capacity for mm production 
revenue from integrated systems increased by from their level  primarily due to increased penetration in the japanese market for our integrated metrology systems through our oem relationship with ebara 
the increase in product revenues resulted from greater demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment  particularly in the us and asia 
we believe that this increased demand was attributable primarily to customers adding capacity in semiconductor production facilities as demand for semiconductors increased as a result of continuing favorable economic conditions in the us and asia in service revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of parts and services in the us and asia in  which we believe was due to a growing installed base of systems that have passed their warranty periods 
the weakening of the japanese yen during the year reduced revenues by approximately million 
in  revenue from automated systems increased by and integrated system revenue increased by from their levels  primarily due to higher volume sales for each product group 
the higher volume of sales for each product group is primarily due to our mm products  such as the atlas automated metrology 
table of contents product and integrated metrology system 
the increase in product revenue resulted from greater demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment and flat panel display equipment  particularly in the us and asia 
we believe that this increased demand was attributable primarily to customers adding capacity in semiconductor production facilities as demand for semiconductors increased as a result of the continuing economic recoveries in the us and japan in service revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of parts and services in the us and asia in  which we believe is due to a growing installed base of systems that have passed their warranty periods 
the strengthening of the japanese yen accounted for approximately million of total net revenues in cost of products 
cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in due primarily to the decline in profitability of our fpd products see sale of flat panel display business unit  below and to a lesser extent  a higher provision for obsolete inventory as compared to the prior year 
cost of products as a percentage of product revenue decreased to in from in due primarily to increased product sales volume in resulting in lower per unit manufacturing costs 
the decrease in cost of products as a percentage of product revenue in was partially offset by a write down of million in slower moving inventory in based on our estimate that future forecasted sales for certain product lines had permanently declined 
the warranty accrual at january  was million  an increase of compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from increased sales volume and the associated warranty costs 
cost of service 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue increased slightly to in from in primarily as a result of higher customer service levels from our growing customer base  particularly in asia 
cost of service as a percentage of service revenue increased from in to in primarily as a result of higher service costs from an increase in headcount and related overhead to provide additional support for our growing customer base  particularly in asia 
we could not fully recoup these costs in either year due to higher service demands from our customer base 
research and development 
research and development expenses were essentially flat with a slight decrease of to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to a research grant received from the korean of million and reflective of our cost cutting initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of including the sale of our fpd business unit in japan 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily from lower materials expenses in resulting from cost cutting measures in the first half of the year 
in the united states  our research and development efforts are focused on semiconductor metrology 
in south korea  our research and development efforts are focused on the overlay metrology 
in japan  our research and development efforts are focused on tabletop metrology 
we are committed to the development of new and enhanced products and believe that new product introductions are required for us to maintain a competitive position 
we expect research and development expenses to remain at current levels for the immediate future 
selling 
selling expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to headcount reductions in sales and personnel related expenses 
selling expenses increased slightly to million in as compared to million in the increase in selling expenses was due to higher sales commissions in over levels as a result of higher sales volume in this increase in was partially offset by the redeployment of some resources into service support  which resulted in a decrease of about of our selling expenses in japan 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a result of professional services associated with compliance with regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act  legal expenses related to our ongoing patent infringement lawsuits  increased headcount as we have expanded and enhanced our finance function and expenses associated with the restatement of our financial results for and the first two quarters of general and administrative 
table of contents expenses increased from million in to million in due in part to higher regulatory expenses 
merger termination fee 
on january   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with august technology corporation 
on june   we and august technology corporation announced the termination of the merger agreement 
on that date  in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  august technology paid us a merger termination fee of million and also paid us million as reimbursement of our expenses associated with the merger agreement which we had capitalized in the first and second quarters of asset impairment 
in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to certain assets in our fpd business unit 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we should assess the recoverability of assets when events become known which would indicate potential impairment 
we evaluated the estimated future cash flows of certain asset groups in our fpd business unit and determined the undiscounted estimated future cash flows would be insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets 
the impairment charge was measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset groups in excess of the associated discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge during the second quarter of total other income  net 
total other income  net  which primarily consists of interest income  interest expense and foreign currency transaction gains losses  increased to  in from  in primarily due to higher yields on cash investments and  to a lesser extent  higher cash investment balances 
the increase in interest income was offset by higher currency transaction losses  primarily due to the weakening japanese yen 
total other income decreased from  in to  in primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses as well as lower interest income in provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and respectively 
our income tax expense in and was primarily a result of foreign income taxes as our us federal income taxes were primarily offset by a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
the tax expense in resulted from a provision for income taxes of million which primarily represented a charge to record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets 
the charge was taken as a result of pretax losses incurred over the past several quarters coupled with uncertainty about future expected income in the then existing market environment  making it more likely than not at that time that the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
in the future  we will continue to review our expectations for future taxable income to determine the amount of valuation allowance necessary to reserve against deferred tax assets 
sale of flat panel display business unit during  our fpd business unit experienced a significant decline in net revenues and related gross profit as other competitors entered the market for these products 
for  flat panel sales declined to approximately million  and less than gross margin  from approximately million of sales and gross margins of approximately for the corresponding prior year 
because of the expected continued decline in profitability  we decided to exit this market 
in september  we entered into an agreement to sell our fpd business unit to toho technology corporation  or toho  effective october toho received a non exclusive perpetual license to use and sell our film thickness measurements systems in the flat panel market in exchange for million 
in addition  toho will pay us a royalty on future sales in excess of million 
toho also purchased certain other existing assets from us including million of inventory and million of equipment related to the fpd business unit 
we did not recognize a gain or loss on this transaction as we had previously evaluated the estimated future cash flows of the fpd asset group and determined the undiscounted estimated future cash flows would be insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets and we recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal see asset impairment above 

table of contents we have also agreed with toho to continue to provide sales efforts for fpd products and maintenance service for installed units in certain asian countries 
we will receive a commission from toho on their future sales of fpd products in certain designated countries 
as a result of the sale of the fpd business unit  we do not expect this revenue will be replaced except to the extent that we receive future sales commissions from toho 
we expect the sale of the fpd business unit to have an accretive effect to future operating results and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million compared to million at january  and million at january  the short term investments consist of us treasury bills 
our working capital of million at december  increased from million at january  and million at january  operating activities provided net cash of million in this source of cash in resulted primarily from net income  including the merger termination fee of million  and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of operating activities provided net cash of million in this source of cash in resulted primarily from net income and non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and higher levels of current liabilities 
these sources of cash were offset to a large extent by higher accounts receivable resulting from our revenue increase of in the increase in accounts receivable was due to the higher concentration of revenue in the third and fourth quarters of as compared to investing activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in the timing of purchases and the initial maturities of us treasury bills result in their classification as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments 
the increase in cash from investing activities was primarily attributable to a net reduction in the maturities of our us treasury bills such that they were classified as cash equivalents at december  our capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenditures in were used primarily to continue the process of internalizing our manufacturing capacity in the united states through  for example  the purchase of a machine shop  machining equipment and improvements to our building 
this internalization process was completed in the first quarter of and as a result capital expenditures decreased in subsequent periods 
financing activities provided net cash of million in  million in and million in primarily resulting from the sale of shares under our stock option plans  offset to some extent by the net repayment of debt obligations by our japanese subsidiary 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
some of these activities might require significant cash outlays 
however  we believe that our working capital  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  will be sufficient to meet our needs at least through the next twelve months 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  we may seek outside financing opportunistically in the future 
we believe our existing working capital  together with expected cash flows from operations and available sources of bank  equity and equipment financing  will be sufficient to support our operations in the future 
on january   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with accent optical technologies accent 
we have agreed to loan accent an aggregate of million to fund its operating activities between the signing of the merger agreement and closing  which is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of fiscal  subject to customary closing conditions 
as of march   we have advanced a total of  to accent under this agreement 
in addition  if the merger is consummated  it may result in cash outflows related to integration activities 
estimates of these outflows are not currently known 
our management and the management 
table of contents of accent are in the process of making these assessments 
notwithstanding the cash outflows that may result from integrating the two companies  we believe the merger  if consummated  will enhance our liquidity and capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total payments due by period less than year years years more than years debt obligations revolving line of credit operating lease obligations our debt obligations primarily relate to the expansion of our japanese facilities and do not include interest  which we are obligated to pay 
we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components 
our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of december  was approximately million 
actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition  the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or cancelled 
certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements

in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk a substantial part of our business consists of sales made to customers outside the united states  and of sales in  and  respectively 
a portion of the net revenues we receive from such sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our costs of net revenues and our other operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and denominated in local currencies 
foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of million  and million in and  respectively and a gain of million in in addition  our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from current intercompany accounts in which costs primarily product costs from the united states are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in us dollars and the net payable to the united states parent amounted to million as of december  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate at december  would result in less than million increase or decrease in transaction gains or losses which would be included in our net income 
in foreign locations we have approximately million of net assets  including long term loans payable to the united states parent  and  as a result  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate at december  would result in approximately million increase or decrease in the net assets and a corresponding increase or decrease in other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the short term nature of these investments  interest rate changes would not have a material impact on their value at december  and january  we also have fixed rate yen denominated debt obligations in japan that have no interest rate risk 
at december  and january   our total debt obligation was million and million  respectively  with a long term portion of million and million  respectively 
in addition  at december   we have borrowed million at under a revolving line of credit 
a hypothetical change in interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on our results of operations
