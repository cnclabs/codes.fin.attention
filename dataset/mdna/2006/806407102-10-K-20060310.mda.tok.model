recent developments during the third quarter ended september   we reached a decision to divest our hospital supply business hospital supply business which is a component of our healthcare distribution business 
the primary reason for this decision was that the hospital supply business does not focus on our core customer  namely the office based practitioner  and therefore provides little or no synergies with our core operations 
we have classified the operating results of the hospital supply business as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in connection with this divestiture  we assessed our long lived assets for impairment  which resulted in us recording in the third quarter an impairment charge of million million after tax for the full write down of all long lived assets  including goodwill of million 
on march   we entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets of our hospital supply business  as well as our extended care business the results of which are not material 
the purchase price is million  with million due at closing and million due days after closing  subject to certain post closing contingent payments by us described below 
the closing is conditioned upon the buyer obtaining financing and our entering into a transition services agreement with the buyer  as well as other customary closing conditions 
based on this sale agreement  we expect to record a loss on disposal  net 
table of contents of tax  of between million and million or and per diluted share  at the time of closing  which will be presented as part of the results from discontinued operations 
we agreed to make payments to the buyer  up to a maximum of million  contingent upon the collection of specified accounts receivable within one year and contingent upon the maintenance of a specified level of aggregate sales of the hospital supply business during the two year post closing period 
any payments made in connection with these contingencies will be presented as part of the results from discontinued operations 
executive level overview we believe we are the largest distributor of healthcare products and services primarily to office based healthcare practitioners in the combined north american and european markets 
we serve more than  customers worldwide  including dental practices and laboratories  physician practices and veterinary clinics  as well as government and other institutions 
we believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than years of experience distributing healthcare products 
we are headquartered in melville  new york  employ nearly  people and have operations in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  the netherlands  belgium  germany  france  austria  portugal  spain  the czech republic  luxembourg  italy  ireland  switzerland  israel  australia and new zealand 
we also have an affiliate in iceland 
we have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency 
this infrastructure  together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices  and a strong commitment to customer service  enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers needs 
our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid  accurate and complete order fulfillment 
we conduct our business through two reportable segments healthcare distribution and technology 
these segments offer different products and services to the same customer base 
the healthcare distribution reportable segment aggregates our dental  medical including veterinary and international operating segments 
products distributed consist of consumable products  small equipment  laboratory products  large dental equipment  branded and generic pharmaceuticals  vaccines  surgical products  diagnostic tests  infection control products and vitamins 
our dental group serves office based dental practices  schools and other institutions in the combined united states and canadian dental market 
our medical group serves office based physician practices  surgical centers  other alternate care settings  veterinarian clinics and other institutions throughout the united states 
our international group serves countries outside of north america and is what we believe to be a leading european healthcare supplier serving office based practices 
our technology group provides software  technology and other value added services to healthcare providers  primarily in the united states and canada 
our value added practice solutions include practice management software systems for dental and medical practices and veterinary clinics 
our technology group offerings also include financial services and continuing education services for practitioners 
industry overview in recent years  the healthcare industry has increasingly focused on cost containment 
this trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices 
it also has accelerated the growth of hmos  group practices  other managed care accounts and collective buying groups  which  in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices  tend to favor distributors 
table of contents capable of providing specialized management information support 
we believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for practice management systems and software that can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management 
our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies and transactions we undertook to expand our business  domestically and internationally  in part to address significant changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation of healthcare distribution companies  potential healthcare reform  trends toward managed care  cuts in medicare and collective purchasing arrangements 
industry consolidation the healthcare products distribution industry  as it relates to office based healthcare practitioners  is highly fragmented and diverse 
this industry  which encompasses the dental  medical and veterinary markets  was estimated to produce revenues of approximately billion in in the combined north american and western and central european markets 
the industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices 
due in part to the inability of office based healthcare practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices  the distribution of healthcare supplies and small equipment to office based healthcare practitioners has been characterized by frequent  small quantity orders  and a need for rapid  reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment 
the purchasing decisions within an office based healthcare practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant  and supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor  with one generally serving as the primary supplier 
we believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors  particularly those with limited financial and marketing resources  seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities 
this consolidation may also continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base 
our trend with regard to acquisitions has been to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry 
this trend has resulted in expansion into service areas that complement our existing operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with  and thus strengthen  the acquired businesses 
as industry consolidation continues  we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this trend  as we believe we have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure 
in the us dental market  we estimate that there are currently more than smaller distributors holding approximately of the market 
in the us medical market  we estimate that more than smaller distributors hold approximately of the market  and in the european dental market  we estimate that more than competitors hold approximately of the market 
as the healthcare industry continues to change  we continually evaluate possible candidates for merger or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our role as a provider of products and services to the healthcare industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue any such opportunity or consummate any such transaction  if pursued 
if additional transactions are entered into or consummated  we would incur additional merger and acquisition related costs  and there can be no assurance that the integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful 
aging population and other market influences the healthcare products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population  increased healthcare awareness  the proliferation of medical technology and testing  new pharmacology 
table of contents treatments and expanded third party insurance coverage 
in addition  the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing shifting from hospitals to alternate care sites  particularly physicians offices 
as the cosmetic surgery and elective procedure markets continue to grow  physicians are increasingly performing more of these procedures in their offices 
the healthcare market continues to benefit from the increasing growth rate of the population of elderly americans 
the january us bureau of the census estimates that the elderly population in the united states will more than double by the year in  four million americans were aged or older  the segment of the population most in need of healthcare services 
by the year  that number is projected to more than triple to more than million 
the population aged to years is projected to more than double in the same time period 
as a result of these market dynamics  the annual expenditures for healthcare services continue to increase in the united states 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms published national health care expenditures projections indicating that total national healthcare spending reached trillion in  or of the nation s gross domestic product 
healthcare spending is projected to reach trillion in  an estimated of the nation s gross domestic product  the benchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the united states 
governmental influences the healthcare industry is subject to extensive government regulation  licensure and operating compliance procedures 
national healthcare reform has been the subject of a number of legislative initiatives by congress 
additionally  government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care 
the balanced budget act passed by congress in significantly reduced reimbursement rates for nursing homes and home healthcare providers  affecting spending levels and the overall financial viability of these institutions 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act the medicare act is the largest expansion of the medicare program since its inception  and provides participants with voluntary prescription drug benefits through an interim drug discount card 
the medicare act also includes provisions relating to medication management programs  generic substitution and provider reimbursement 
based upon current information  we believe the medicare act may create additional volume demand and provide incentives for additional use of generic drugs  both of which have potentially positive implications for our pharmaceutical distribution business 
product integrity certain pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers are in discussions with legislators about the risks of counterfeit products in the supply chain and manufacturers concerns about the impact of secondary market distribution on counterfeiting 
as a distributor of such products  we continue to work with our suppliers to help minimize the risks associated with counterfeit products in the supply chain and potential litigation

as a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks throughout our industry  our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies 
additionally  we realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in our healthcare distribution segment 
these higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of software products combined with the nature of the software industry  in which developers realize higher gross margins to recover investments in research and development

liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include the funding of acquisitions  working capital needs  capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock 
working capital requirements generally result from increased sales  special inventory forward buy in opportunities  and payment terms for receivables and payables 
because sales tend to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory forward buy in opportunities are most prevalent just before the end of the year  our working capital requirements have generally been higher from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of the following year 
we finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations  revolving credit facilities  private placement debt and stock issuances 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers for  and supply by our vendors of  our products and services 
given current operating  economic and industry conditions  we believe that demand for our products and services will remain consistent in the foreseeable future 
we do not expect the loss of cash flows from discontinued operations to have a material impact on our future liquidity or capital resources 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
this net change of million was due primarily to our increased sales and profit and our management of working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the net change of million was primarily due to a combination of items including lower payments for business acquisitions and net cash receipts from the settlements of foreign exchange contracts  partially offset by increased capital expenditures and investments 
we expect to invest approximately million during fiscal year in capital projects to modernize and expand our facilities and computer systems infrastructure and to integrate certain operations 
approximately million of such expected capital expenditures relate to a new distribution center in france 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the prior year period

table of contents in  we completed an issuance of million of convertible debt 
these notes are senior unsecured obligations bearing a fixed annual interest rate of and are due to mature on august  interest on the notes is payable on february and august of each year  which commenced on february  the notes are convertible into our common stock at a conversion ratio of shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes  which is the equivalent conversion price of per share  under the following circumstances if the last price of our common stock is above of the conversion price measured over a specified number of trading days  during the five business day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading prices for the notes for that trading day period was less than of the average conversion value for the notes during that period  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change or specified corporate transactions  as defined in the note agreement 
upon conversion  we are required to satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the principal amount of the notes to be converted  in cash  with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock 
we currently have sufficient availability of funds through our million revolving credit facility discussed below along with cash on hand to fully satisfy the cash portion of our conversion obligation

this program previously allowed us to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock  which represented approximately of shares outstanding on the announcement date 
on october   our board authorized an additional million of shares in our common stock to be repurchased under this program 
as of december   we had repurchased million or  shares under this initiative  with million remaining 

table of contents some minority shareholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right at certain times to require us to acquire their ownership interest in those entities at a price that approximates fair value pursuant to a formula price as defined in the agreements 
additionally  some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash consideration if certain profitability targets are met 
we accrue liabilities that may arise from these transactions when we believe the outcome of the contingency is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
we finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least months 
funding requirements are based on forecasted profitability and working capital needs  which  on occasion  may change 
consequently  we may change our funding structure to reflect any new requirements 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets  and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our currently foreseeable short term and long term capital needs 
e commerce traditional healthcare supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions 
our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition 
the advancement of online commerce will require us to cost effectively adapt to changing technologies  to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
through our proprietary  technologically based suite of products  we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives 
we believe that our tradition of reliable service  our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships position us well to participate in this growing aspect of the distribution business 
we continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our internet presence and capabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  industry and market trends  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  by their nature  estimates are subject to various assumptions and uncertainties 
reported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions  judgments and estimates  including the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were to be applied 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  which have been discussed with our audit committee  affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of dental  medical and veterinary consumable products  as well as equipment  software products and services and other sources 
provisions for discounts  rebates to customers  customer returns and other contra revenue adjustments are recorded based upon historical data and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are recognized 

table of contents revenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped to customers 
such sales typically entail high volume  low dollar orders shipped using third party common carriers 
we believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating the completion of the earnings process because we have no post shipment obligations  the product price is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when products are delivered to customers 
such sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily by equipment service technicians 
some equipment sales require minimal installation  which is completed at the time of delivery 
revenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products are shipped to customers 
such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training due to the nature of its design 
revenue derived from post contract customer support for software  including annual support and or training  is recognized over the period in which the services are provided 
revenue derived from other sources including freight charges  equipment repairs and financial services  is recognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when the services are provided 
accounts receivable and reserves the carrying amount of accounts receivable reflects a reserve representing our best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected 
in addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable  we consider many factors in estimating our reserve  including historical data  experience  customer types  credit worthiness and economic trends 
from time to time  we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect collectibility 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to accounts receivable and reserves are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results 
inventory and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined primarily by the first in  first out method 
in performing our lower of cost or market valuation  we consider many factors including the condition and salability of the inventory  historical sales  forecasted sales and market and economic trends 
from time to time  we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any of these or other factors expected to affect salability 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to inventory and reserves are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment analyses 
such impairment analyses require the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of reporting units 
measuring fair value of a reporting unit is generally based on valuation techniques using multiples of sales or earnings  unless supportable information is available for using a present value technique  such as estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
we regard our reporting units to be our operating segments dental  medical including veterinary  international and technology 
goodwill was allocated to such reporting units  for the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses  based on a specific identification basis 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets annually and on an interim basis whenever events or 
table of contents changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger an interim impairment review  include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of income 
vendor rebates vendor rebates are included as a reduction to cost of sales and are recognized as they are earned 
the factors we consider in estimating vendor rebate accruals include forecasted inventory purchases and sales  in conjunction with vendor rebate contract terms  which generally provide for increasing rebates based on either increased purchase or sales volume 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect our financial results 
long lived assets long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 
definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of non compete agreements  trademarks  trade names and customer relationships 
when an impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions used in determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
stock based compensation through december   we accounted for stock option awards to employees under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  no compensation expense is recorded provided the exercise price is equal to or greater than the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date 
we make pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting the alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation had been applied as required by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value based method requires us to make assumptions to determine expected risk free interest rates  stock price volatility  dividend yield and weighted average option life 
as of january   in connection with our adoption of fas r share based payment  discussed below stock based compensation is included in our results of operations 
the method and assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation under fas r are similar to those used under fas

r  share based payment 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement changes the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in fas as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  and applies to all outstanding and unvested stock based payment awards at the date of adoption 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which discussed the sec s interpretation of fas r and the related valuation of share based compensation for public companies 
we are assessing the requirements of both fas r and sab and the impact that these pronouncements will have on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we anticipate the adoption of fas r will affect our results of operations to an extent similar to that as presented in our fas pro forma disclosure included in the accompanying audited financial statements

previously  apb opinion no 
required most voluntary changes in accounting to be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change in accounting in net income in the period of change 
this statement also requires a change in method of depreciation  amortization or depletion for a long lived asset be accounted for as a change in estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
fas is effective for us beginning january  when adopted  this statement could have an impact on prior year consolidated financial statements if we have a change in accounting 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue  the meaning of conventional convertible debt instrument in eitf issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock

we do not anticipate this issue will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar and each other 
we attempt to minimize these risks by using interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency forward and swap contracts 
these hedging activities provide only limited protection against interest rate and currency exchange risks 
factors that could influence the effectiveness of our programs include volatility of the interest rate and currency markets and availability of hedging instruments 
all interest rate swap and foreign currency forward and swap contracts that we enter into are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated interest rate and currency exposure 
we do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements we have fixed rate senior notes of million at and million at 
during  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange these fixed interest rates for variable interest rates 
the variable rates are comprised of libor plus the spreads and reset on the interest due dates for the senior notes 
as a result of these interest rate swap agreements  as well as our existing variable rate credit lines and loan agreements  we are exposed to risk from changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
as of december   the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements recorded in other non current liabilities was million  which represented the amount that would be paid upon unwinding the interest rate swap agreements based on market conditions at that time 
changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements are reflected as an adjustment to non current assets or liabilities with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the million notes as such hedges are deemed fully effective 
foreign currency agreements the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings  all of which are expressed in us dollars 
where we deem it prudent  we engage in hedging programs  using primarily foreign currency forward and swap contracts  aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on earnings 
we purchase short term ie  twelve months or less foreign currency forward and swap contracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with long term intercompany loans due from our international subsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign vendors 
we do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into us dollars  as we regard this as an accounting exposure  not an economic exposure 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward and swap contracts with notional amounts of million  of which million related to intercompany debt and million related to the purchase of merchandise from foreign vendors 
the contracts hedge currency fluctuations against the us dollar for euros million  british pounds million  australian dollars million  swiss francs million  japanese yen thousand and canadian dollars million 
in addition  our international business entered into hedges against currency fluctuations relative to local functional currencies 
the notional amount of such contracts was million 
a hypothetical change of the value of the us dollar would change the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements by million 
as of december   the fair value of our foreign currency exchange agreements  which expire through december   recorded in other current assets was million  as determined by quoted market prices 
for the year ended december   we had realized net gains of thousand and unrealized gains of million relating to such agreements
