item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
we generate revenues from the sale of semiconductor devices that we have designed and developed 
almost all of our revenues in any given year come from the sale of semiconductors that are developed prior to that year 
for example  the majority of our revenues in came from parts developed in and earlier 
after an individual product is completed and announced it may take several years before that device generates any significant revenues 
our current revenue is generated by a portfolio of more than products 
in addition to selling  general and administrative costs  we expend a substantial amount every year for the development of new semiconductor devices 
we determine the amount to invest in the development of new semiconductors based on our assessment of the future market opportunities for those components  and the estimated return on investment 
to compete globally we must invest in businesses and technologies that are both growing in demand and cost competitive in the geographic markets that we serve 
demand for the majority of the products and solutions that we sell is largely driven by the capital spending of service providers in the telecommunications industry  and traditionally our sales in this market area have represented the majority of our annual revenues approximately in 
demand for our products and solutions that are driven by the capital spending of corporations  enterprises  and smaller businesses  have represented a smaller portion of revenues approximately in 
on february   we completed the acquisition of the former storage semiconductor business of agilent for approximately million in cash  subject to a final inventory adjustment 
we expect that beginning in  the mix of our combined total networking revenues will shift to approximately from the telecommunications market and from the enterprise and storage markets 
in order to align our fiscal year end with the calendar year end  fiscal consisted of weeks compared to in net revenues millions change change net revenues net revenues for decreased million  or compared to net revenues for revenues were lower than in due to a lower volume of units sold in the first half of compared to the first half of due to an inventory rebalancing by our customers that began in the third quarter of and continued into quarterly revenues have increased sequentially since the fourth quarter of but are still below levels recorded in early in the first half of  revenues increased sequentially for several reasons 
first  reduced levels of inventories at end customers led to stronger orders  second  telecom related capital 
table of contents spending in our end markets continued to increase  especially in the metro transport area  and third  product cycles in the enterprise storage markets favored the company s product offering 
increases in revenues in the second half of were due in large part to improved activity levels in edge routing multi service switching  enterprise storage  and our laser printer business 
net revenues for increased million  or over net revenues in during the first half of  we saw increased revenues from the markets for our telecommunication service provider products  particularly for asymmetric digital subscriber line  or adsl  wireless  and wireline infrastructure applications in china and north america  improving demand for equipment that incorporates our metro optical transport products and relatively low levels of supply chain inventories  resulting in new orders for pmc products 
during the second half of we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues due to telecom and enterprise customers working down their inventory levels and lower order rates from china 
this inventory rebalancing was not specific to any one customer or area of our business  but was related to customers in general adjusting inventory levels down to reflect shorter component lead times and lower equipment demand levels 
in the third quarter of  we approved a routine request from one of our distributors to dispose of certain slow moving inventory  and we completed a specific inventory reduction program  which resulted in net revenue of million 
companies in the semiconductor industry periodically undertake such initiatives to reduce slow moving inventory in sales channels so that customers maintain a mix of inventory suitable for current market demand 
all criteria for revenue recognition were met as the inventory was delivered  title was transferred  payment was received and the price became fixed at the time the inventory was disposed of 
all of the economic incentives offered to the distributor were included in our third quarter results of operations as revenue reductions 
over the past three years  we have seen significant growth in net revenues generated in asia 
net revenues from asia have grown to of total net revenues in  from in  and in we attribute this trend primarily to increased manufacturing outsourcing into asia by our oem customers as well as increased levels of activity at asian customers 
gross profit millions change change gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit for increased by million over gross profit in  which increased by million  or over gross profit in despite overall lower sales volumes in  gross profit improved due in part to the centralizing of our manufacturing logistics teams into a single location through our restructuring activities  as well as tightly managing our manufacturing costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in as a result of the following factors yield improvements and procurement cost reductions  which increased gross profit by approximately percentage point  
table of contents engineering fees charged to customers for engineering we undertook on their behalf increased from million in to million in  increasing gross profit by percentage point  and fixed manufacturing costs were spread over lower shipment volumes  reducing gross profit by percentage point 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this increase resulted from the following factors higher shipment volumes resulted in manufacturing costs being spread over a greater number of units  increasing gross profit by percentage points  and a greater portion of our sales were from our higher margin products  which increased gross profit by approximately percentage points 
expenses millions change change research and development percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative percentage of net revenues restructuring costs percentage of net revenues research and development expenses our research and development  or r d  expenses were million  or  lower in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of million less in personnel costs resulting from workforce reductions initiated in  which were partially offset by an incremental week in the first quarter and compensation increases in the second quarter of in addition  development costs were lower by million due to the timing of design completions 
these decreases were offset by higher hardware and software costs of million  increased depreciation of million  and higher travel costs of million 
amortization of intellectual property was higher by million due to purchases of intellectual property in the second half of  and other costs were lower by million 
our research and development  or r d  expenses were million  or  higher in compared to due primarily to a million increase in personnel and contractor costs and a million increase in amortization of intellectual property related to developed technology acquired in fiscal these increases were offset by a million reduction in depreciation expense as equipment and development tools became fully depreciated and were not replaced 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million  or higher in compared to our sg a personnel and related costs increased by million due to an incremental week in the first quarter and compensation adjustments 
in addition  increased recruitment  travel and training activities resulted in higher costs of approximately million 
facilities costs allocated to sg a increased by million 
of the remaining increase  was due to higher professional fees from incremental tax consulting and internal audit  million was attributable to higher commissions  and other expenses increased by million 
these increases were offset by a million reversal of a provision for doubtful accounts receivable based on the completion of an analysis of the credit status of a significant customer due to a change in ownership 
sg a expenses were lower by a further million because we eliminated a provision for employee related taxes on completion of a payroll tax audit in that year 
our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million  or less than higher in compared to due primarily to a million increase in personnel and contractor costs which was offset by a million reduction in depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated and were not replaced 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we eliminated a million provision as described above 
restructuring costs and other charges restructurings during  we carried out various restructuring activities aimed at streamlining production and reducing our operating expenses 
in the first quarter  we recorded restructuring charges of million in severance costs related to the termination of employees across all business functions 
in the second quarter  we expanded the workforce reduction activities initiated during the first quarter and terminated r d employees from research and development located in our santa clara facility 
in addition  we consolidated our two manufacturing facilities santa clara  california and burnaby  british columbia into one facility burnaby  which involved the termination of employees from production control  quality assurance  and product engineering 
as a result  we recorded total second quarter restructuring charges of million  including million for termination benefits and a million write down of equipment and software assets whose value was impaired as a result of these plans 
in the third quarter  we consolidated our facilities and vacated excess office space in the santa clara location  and recorded a restructuring charge of million for excess facilities and million in severance costs 
as of december   the software assets have been disposed of and million severance costs remain to be paid in payments related to the excess facilities will extend to on completion of these plans we expect to achieve annual savings of approximately million 
restructurings and in and  we implemented three restructuring plans aimed at focusing development efforts on key projects and reducing operating costs in response to the severe and prolonged economic downturn in the semiconductor industry 
cost reductions in all other functional areas were also implemented  as fewer resources were required to support the reduced level of development and sales activities during these periods 

table of contents the january restructuring included the termination of employees and the closure of design centers in maryland  ireland and india 
to date  we have recorded restructuring charges of million related to workforce reduction  lease and contract settlement costs  and the write down of certain property  equipment and software assets whose value was impaired as a result of this restructuring plan 
we have disposed of the property improvements and computer equipment  and software licenses have been cancelled or are no longer being used 
cash payments made to date under this plan have been million 
a million reversal of excess restructure provision relating primarily to workforce reduction was recorded in the october restructuring plan included the termination of employees  the consolidation of excess facilities  and the curtailment of certain research and development projects  resulting in a restructuring charge of million  including million of asset write downs 
to date  we have made cash payments under this plan of million  including the purchase and sale of mission towers two in santa clara  ca  for million and million  respectively  in the third quarter of to date  we have reversed million of excess restructure provision  primarily related to mission towers two 
due to the continued downturn in real estate markets  the facilities costs are expected to be higher than anticipated in the original plan and as a result  we recorded additional provisions for abandoned office facilities of million in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for a restructuring plan that included the termination of employees across all business functions  the consolidation of a number of facilities and the curtailment of certain research and development projects 
to date  we have made cash payments of million under this plan 
due to the continued downturn in real estate markets  we expect these costs to be higher than anticipated in the original plan 
as a result  we recorded additional provisions for abandoned office facilities of million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we have completed the activities contemplated in these restructuring plans  but have not yet terminated the leases on our surplus facilities 
efforts to exit these sites are ongoing  but the payments related to these facilities could extend to the activity related to excess facility accruals under all plans during the three years ended december   and activity related to the accrual for severance  were as follows excess facility costs in thousands january october march total balance at december  reversals and adjustments charges cash payments balance at december  reversals and adjustments charges cash payments balance at december  charges cash payments balance at december  severance costs in thousands january october march total balance at december  charges cash payments balance at december  these restructuring plans have changed only the scope  and not the nature  of our operations 
through these restructuring activities we streamlined production and refocused our product development and sales activities on a smaller number of products and end users 
other income and expenses millions change change interest income  net percentage of net revenues foreign exchange loss percentage of net revenues gain loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of debt issue costs percentage of net revenues gain on sale of investments percentage of net revenues 
table of contents interest income  net net interest income increased by million in compared to at december   million of our convertible subordinated notes were outstanding 
on january   we redeemed these notes for a total of million in cash  which included million in accrued interest and a million call premium  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million for compared to in the fourth quarter of  we issued million senior convertible notes  resulting in higher net interest income of approximately million as the yield on the short term deposits exceeded the interest rate on the notes 
we earned an additional million due to higher average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments 
in our interest income increased million compared to due to interest expense savings of million from the repurchase of a portion of our convertible subordinated notes 
these savings were partially offset by a decline in interest revenue of million due to a decline in cash balances and average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments 
foreign exchange loss foreign exchange loss increased to million in compared to million in and million in we have a significant design presence outside the united states  especially in canada 
the majority of our operating expense exposures to changes in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar have been hedged through december the foreign exchange loss for all years presented relates primarily to the re measurement of accrued income tax amounts in our canadian subsidiary 
we do not hedge our accrual for canadian income taxes in the ordinary course of business see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gain loss on extinguishment of debt and amortization of debt issue costs on january   we redeemed our remaining outstanding convertible subordinated notes as described above 
we expensed the million call premium and the remaining unamortized debt issue costs of million  resulting in an aggregate net loss on redemption of million 
we recognized a loss of million in  and gain of million in  as a result of repurchasing portions of these notes 
amortization of debt issue costs related to these notes was million in and million in in the fourth quarter of  we issued million senior convertible notes and recognized amortization of debt issue costs of million 

table of contents gain on sale of investments in february  we recorded a gain on sale of investments when we received million that had been in escrow for one year pending final settlement of the sale of our investment in a private technology company 
in february we recorded a gain of million from this sale  which excluded the escrowed portion of the proceeds 
in march  we received million as final satisfaction of the mortgage owed to us for a property we sold in as part of the agreement we surrendered an option to purchase the property 
the difference between the proceeds and the carrying value of the mortgage receivable was recorded as a gain of million 
provision for income taxes our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was recovery of  recovery of compared to a united states federal statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate represents a rate that is applicable to all of our operations crossing multiple tax jurisdictions with tax rates that are different than the united states federal statutory tax rate 
we also operate in tax jurisdictions that have regulations that permit the carry back of current period tax losses and credits to prior periods when income taxes were paid 
our effective tax rate in all years presented reflects recoveries and refunds of prior year taxes paid and tax credits received by our canadian subsidiary for research and development expenses incurred  offset by valuation allowances on losses carried forward 
our provision for income taxes was affected by three factors 
first  we decreased our expected annual effective tax rate from to based on a sensitivity analysis that considered tax credits available to offset forecast levels of net income 
second  we reversed a million accrual for state taxes based on the completion of a tax audit 
third  we recovered million in r d tax credits in excess of amounts that had previously been recorded 
in  we estimated that the effective tax rate applicable to our operations was 
however  we reduced our tax liabilities associated with current period income primarily for amounts we have or expect to recover from prior year taxes as a result of agreements and assessments with the canada revenue agency 
for the year ended december  we estimated our effective tax rate to be 
however  primarily as a result of additional initiatives undertaken to identify and carry back tax losses to prior periods when taxes were paid  our tax rate for the period was a recovery of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report as assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are reasonable in the circumstances 
these estimates could change under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgment and involve complex estimation 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies of revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to major distributors  however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates as they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
restructuring charges facilities in calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities we had to estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount of sublease revenues 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs for the affected facilities  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease each site 
to form our estimates for these costs we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
during  we recorded total charges of million for the restructuring of excess facilities as part of two restructuring plans 
after elimination of the lease obligation related to mission towers two during  we performed a review of our assumptions relating to the remaining lease commitments using current market conditions for the timing and rates to sublet or cancel the lease for each of the remaining facilities 
based on this analysis we determined that an additional charge of million was required for facilities closure costs due to further deterioration in facilities leasing markets 
based on a similar analysis performed in the fourth quarter of we determined that an additional million was required due to further deterioration in facilities leasing markets 
the accrual at the end of of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for those affected sites 
in the first quarter of  we announced a further restructuring of our operations  which resulted in the closing of an additional four product development sites two in ireland  one in india and our maryland site and in we recorded total charges of million when we abandoned usage of these sites 
the amount unpaid at the end of of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for the affected sites 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we recorded charges of million for the restructuring of excess facilities in connection with the restructuring plans implemented in the total remaining estimate of million represents of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for the site 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until lease termination  or the amounts and timing of offsetting sublease revenues may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
if our actual costs exceed our estimates  we would incur additional expenses in future periods 
income taxes in estimating our annual effective tax rate we review our forecasted net income for the year by geographic area and apply the appropriate tax rates 
we also consider the income tax credits available in each tax jurisdiction 
based on an analysis performed in the first quarter of  we reduced our effective tax rate from to 
our operations are conducted in a number of countries with complex tax legislation and regulations pertaining to our activities 
we have recorded income tax liabilities based on our estimates and interpretations of those regulations for the countries we operate in 
however our estimates are subject to review and assessment by the tax authorities and the courts of those countries 
the timing of any such review and final assessment of our liabilities by local authorities is substantially out of our control and is dependent on the actions by those authorities in the countries we operate in 
any re assessment of our tax liabilities by tax authorities may result in adjustments of the income taxes we pay or refunds that are due to us 
in certain jurisdictions we have incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce our tax liability on those earnings 
as we are uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  we have taken a valuation allowance against all domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
investment in private entities we have investments in private companies and a venture capital fund  which we review periodically to determine if there has been a non temporary decline in the market value of those investments below our carrying value 
our assessment of impairment in carrying value is based on the market value trends of similar public companies  the current business performance of the entities in which we have invested  and if available  the estimated future market potential of the companies and venture funds 
in we recorded a charge of million for impairment of our investments in private entities 
we did not record such an impairment charge in or when we perform future assessments of these investments  a further decline in the value of these companies may require us to recognize additional impairment on the remaining carrying value of our investments 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we review property and equipment  goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events may include a change in business strategy  significant declines in our sales forecast or prolonged negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
for long lived assets  an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
for goodwill  an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent than the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
in we recorded a million charge for impairment of purchased intangible assets as part of the restructuring activities 
in we recorded a charge for impairment of purchased intangible assets 
we did not identify any impairment to goodwill or purchased intangibles during our annual assessments in business outlook on february   we completed our previously announced acquisition of the former storage semiconductor business of agilent technologies  inc pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement dated october  between pmc and avago technologies pte 
limited avago for approximately million in cash  subject to a final inventory adjustment 
we expect that revenue from this acquisition for the month of march will likely be between and million 
excluding the impact of this acquisition  we expect our revenues for the first quarter of to be approximately to million based on typical order patterns 
as in the past  and consistent with business practice in the semiconductor industry  a portion of our revenues are likely to be derived from orders placed and shipped during the same quarter  which we call our turns business 
our turns business varies from quarter to quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  net orders booked and shipped within the quarter were approximately of quarterly sales 
our long term average turns percentage is approximately 
however  due to the shortening of lead times on some products  the turns percentage is expected to increase slightly in the first quarter of  to approximately to 
we expect that we will incur significant acquisition related costs and expenses in the first quarter of including amortization of purchased intangible assets 
we anticipate that interest income will decrease in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of due to the cash paid for the acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity at december  was million in cash and short term investments 
on february   we spent approximately million of this amount to acquire the former agilent storage semiconductor business 

table of contents in  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
changes in working capital accounts included an million increase in accounts receivable  which increased our calculated number of days outstanding at the end of to compared to at the end of as a result of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  acquisition of memec  our main distributor  by avnet  which is slower to pay than memec  and a reversal of million of our allowance for doubtful accounts in the second quarter of  a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of payments including million higher trade accounts payable and million increase in accrued personnel related costs  a million increase in net income tax liabilities due to an million increase for accrual of current year taxes  million increase from re measurement from canadian dollars into us dollars  million reduction for recoveries of prior year taxes and additional income tax credits and reduction for installments net of re assessments  a million reduction in inventory purchases  which increased the calculated number of times our inventory turned over on an annualized basis from at the end of to at the end of  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets  due primarily to amortization of software maintenance and rentals that had not been renewed as of the end of  a million increase in deferred income due to greater levels of shipments to our major distributor  avnet  and a increase to accrued restructuring costs due the additional charges of million during  offset by million in payments made related to all restructuring plans for severance and rent 
in cash flows from our investment activities included cash proceeds of million from the sale or maturities of short term and long term debt investments  the purchase of million of long term and short term debt investments  investment of million in property  equipment  and intangible assets  purchase of million in strategic investments  cash proceeds of million from the sale of investments  property and other assets during the year  and cash proceeds of million from the refund of wafer fabrication deposits 

table of contents in cash flows from our financing activities included cash proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior convertible notes in october  net of million debt issuance costs  repurchase of million of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in january  and cash proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under our equity based compensation plans 
as of december  we have the following commitments in thousands total after contractual obligations operating lease obligations minimum rental payments estimated operating cost payments long term debt principal repayment interest payments purchase of storage semiconductor business purchase and other obligations on october   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due and have recorded these notes as long term debt 
issuance costs of million have been deferred and will be amortized over seven years 
the notes are subordinated to all of our future senior indebtedness and mature on october  unless earlier redeemed by us at our option  or converted or put to us at the option of the holders 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  commencing on april  we may redeem all or a portion of the notes at par on and after october  the holders may require that we repurchase notes on october   and respectively 
holders may convert the notes into the right to receive the conversion value i when our stock price exceeds of the approximately per share initial conversion price for a specified period  ii in certain change in control transactions  and iii when the trading price of the notes does not exceed a minimum price level 
for each  principal amount of notes  the conversion value represents the amount equal to shares multiplied by the per share price of our common stock at the time of conversion 
if the conversion value exceeds  per  in principal of notes  we will pay  in cash and may pay the amount exceeding  in cash  stock or a combination of cash and stock  at our election 
on february   we completed the acquisition of the former storage semiconductor business of agilent for million in cash 
purchase obligations are comprised of commitments to purchase design tools and software for use in product development 
included in the purchase commitments above is million in 
table of contents design software tools  which will be spent in the first quarter of we have not included open purchase orders for inventory or other expenses issued in the normal course of business in the purchase obligations shown above 
we estimate these other commitments to be approximately million at december  for inventory and other expenses that will be received in the coming days and that will require settlement days thereafter 
we have a line of credit with a bank that allows us to borrow up to million provided we maintain eligible investments with the bank equal to the amount drawn on the line of credit 
at december  we had committed million under letters of credit as security for office leases 
we expect to use approximately million of cash in for capital expenditures including purchases of intellectual property 
based on our current operating prospects  we believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our projected operating  working capital  capital expenditure  purchase obligations  and remaining restructuring requirements through the end of while we believe our current liquidity will be sufficient to meet our long term needs for capital  we operate in an industry that is subject to rapid technological and economic changes 
in addition  we may contemplate mergers and acquisitions of other companies or assets as part of our business strategy 
consequently in the future we may determine that our sources of liquidity are insufficient and we may proceed with financing or other activities  which may dilute your investment or impact our liquidity and operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the requirements of an entity to measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost of such award will be recognized over the period during which an option holder is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r on a modified prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal and this adoption of fas r will have a significant adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact on our results of operations would have approximated the impact shown in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
cash equivalents  short term investments and investments in bonds and notes we regularly maintain a short and long term investment portfolio of various types of government and corporate debt instruments 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
maturities of these instruments are less than two and one half years  with the majority being within one year 
to minimize credit risk  we diversify our investments and select minimum ratings of p or a by moody s  or a or a by standard and poor s  or equivalent 
we classify these securities as available for sale 
investments in instruments with both fixed and floating rates carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we were to sell securities that have declined in market value because of changes in interest rates 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our investment portfolio by a shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in a decline or increase in portfolio value of approximately million  million and million respectively 
foreign currency our sales and corresponding receivables are denominated primarily in united states dollars 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the united states including canada  europe  the middle east and asia 
we are subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
through our operations in canada and elsewhere outside the united states  we incur research and development  customer support costs and administrative expenses in canadian and other foreign currencies 
we are exposed  in the normal course of business  to foreign currency risks on these expenditures  particularly in canada 
in our effort to manage such risks  we have 
table of contents adopted a foreign currency risk management policy intended to reduce the effects of potential short term fluctuations on our operating results stemming from our exposure to these risks 
as part of this risk management  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts on behalf of our canadian subsidiary 
these forward contracts offset the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted cash flows or firm commitments 
we limit the forward contracts operational period to months or less and we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
because we do not engage in foreign exchange risk management techniques beyond these periods  our cost structure is subject to long term changes in foreign exchange rates 
as at december   we had seven currency forward contracts outstanding that qualified and were designated as cash flow hedges 
the us dollar notional amount of these contracts was million and the contracts had a fair value of million 
we regularly limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from our canadian dollar net asset or liability positions 
we do not hedge our accruals for canadian income taxes in the ordinary course of business  and consequently in we incurred a million foreign exchange loss relating to this item 
our profitability would be materially impacted by a shift in the foreign exchange rates between united states and canadian currencies 
for example  if the value of the united states dollar decreased by relative to the canadian dollar  our profitability would decrease by million 
debt at december   million of our senior convertible notes were outstanding 
because we pay fixed interest coupons on our notes  market interest rate fluctuations do not impact our debt interest payments 
however  the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes will fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of our common stock  changes in market interest rates and changes in our credit worthiness 
our senior convertible notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  but have been traded over the counter  on the portal market or under rule of the securities act of the exchange prices from these trades are not always available to us and may not be reliable 
trades under the portal market do not reflect all trades of the securities and the figures recorded are not independently verified 
the price of our senior convertible notes on the portal market on december  was per in face value  resulting in an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
there were no reported trades on december  the notes are subordinated to all of our future senior indebtedness and mature on october  unless earlier redeemed by us at our option  or converted or put to us at the option of the holders 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  commencing on april  we may redeem all or a portion of the notes at par on and after october  the holders may require that we repurchase notes on october   and respectively 
holders may convert the notes into the right to receive the conversion value i when our stock price exceeds of the approximately per share initial conversion price for a specified period  ii in certain change in control transactions  and iii when the trading price of the notes 
table of contents does not exceed a minimum price level 
for each  principal amount of notes  the conversion value represents the amount equal to shares multiplied by the per share price of our common stock at the time of conversion 
if the conversion value exceeds  per  in principal of notes  we will pay  in cash and may pay the amount exceeding  in cash  stock or a combination of cash and stock  at our election 
at december   million of our convertible subordinated notes were outstanding 
on january  we redeemed the remaining million of these notes for a total of million in cash  which included million in accrued interest and a million call premium
