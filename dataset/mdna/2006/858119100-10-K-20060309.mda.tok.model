forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statements that may project  indicate or imply future results  events  performance or achievements 
we refer you  however  to the sections denominated forward looking statements and risk factors in this report for a more detailed discussion of some of the many factors  variables  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may have expected or anticipated 
we caution that any forward looking statement reflects only our reasonable belief at the time the statement is made 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and respective notes appearing elsewhere in this filing 
operations we are one of the largest steel producers in the united states based on an estimated annual steelmaking capability of million tons  with consolidated shipments totaling million tons 
we produce steel principally from steel scrap  using electric arc melting furnaces  continuous casting and automated rolling mills 
our operations are currently comprised of the following three primary steelmaking facilities our flat roll division which produces flat roll sheet steel and sells a broad range of hot rolled  cold rolled and coated steel products  including a large variety of specialty products such as thinner gauge hot rolled  galvanized and painted products 
our structural and rail division which produces and sells structural steel beams  pilings and other steel components 
this facility is also designed to produce and sell a variety of standard and premium grade rail for the railroad industry 
this division shipped limited amounts of industrial quality rail throughout  and anticipates shipping standard rail during the first half of our bar products division which produces and sells special bar quality and merchant bar quality rounds and round cornered squares and limited amounts of rebar 
our steel operating divisions sell directly to end users and service centers 
our products are used in numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
we also have other operations which include a scrap substitute manufacturing facility  referred to as iron dynamics  two steel fabrication facilities which produce trusses  girders  steel joists and steel decking  referred to as new millennium building systems  and a owned trading and processing facility that receives revenue from the further processing  or slitting  and sale of certain secondary and excess prime steel products 
income statement classifications net sales 
our total net sales are a factor of net tons shipped  product mix and related pricing 
our net sales are determined by subtracting product returns  sales discounts  return allowances and claims from total sales 
we charge premium prices for certain grades of steel  dimensions of product  or certain smaller volumes  based on our cost of production 
we also charge marginally higher prices for our value added products 
these products include hot rolled and cold rolled galvanized products  cold rolled products  and painted products from our flat roll division and certain special bar quality products from our bar products division 
costs of goods sold 
our costs of goods sold represents all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products 
the principal elements of these costs are steel scrap and scrap substitutes  alloys  natural gas  argon  direct and indirect labor and related benefits  electricity  oxygen  electrodes  depreciation  materials and transportation  and freight 
our metallic raw materials  steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant component of our costs of goods sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales  finance and accounting  and administrative departments 
these costs include labor and benefits  professional services  financing cost amortization  property taxes  profit sharing expense and start up costs associated with new projects 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt agreements as described in the notes to our financial statements net of capitalized interest costs that are related to construction expenditures during the construction period of capital projects 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash balances and any other non operating income activity  including gains on certain short term investments 
other expense consists of any non operating costs 
operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted share during  compared with million or per diluted share during when compared to  our average consolidated selling price per ton shipped decreased we experienced a compression of in our gross margin percentage not only due to reduced product pricing  but also due to increased costs associated with our manufacturing processes caused by a change in the types of products produced and higher energy costs 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased slightly to billion while our consolidated shipments increased  tons  or  to million tons  when compared to the increase in shipments was primarily due to increased shipments of  tons from our structural and rail division  as a result of increased demand for structural products for the commercial construction industry and  tons from our bar products division  as a result of the division s continued efforts to penetrate the special bar quality market 
the special bar quality market is dominated by long term customer supply contracts 
our bar products division started operations in january and since that time has been selling into the spot market and commissioning various products for customer testing and certification to develop customer relationships and pursue long term customer supply contracts 
the bar products division will be completing construction of a bar finishing facility during the first quarter of to add processing and inspection capabilities critical to developing longer term supply arrangements 
as depicted by the following graph  our fourth quarter of average consolidated selling price per ton shipped decreased compared with the fourth quarter of  and increased compared with the third quarter of currently we have orders for the first quarter of that suggest we will achieve slightly higher average selling prices than experienced during the fourth quarter of domestic demand for flat rolled products was weaker than expected during the first half of due to excessive inventories at steel service centers and end users 
inventories declined through the first half and the market for flat rolled products improved early in the second half and stabilized through year end 
scrap prices fluctuated significantly through the year but did not reach the historic highs seen in non residential construction activity improved throughout resulting in stronger demand for structural steel  fabricated steel joists and decking and flat rolled steel products 
graphic the following table depicts our product mix by major product category based on tons shipped for the indicated periods 
generally  we incur higher production costs when manufacturing value added products  such as cold rolled  galvanized  and painted flat roll steels  and special bar quality steels 
during  we also experienced an increase in electricity and natural gas costs 
combined electricity and natural gas costs were and of total costs of goods sold during and  respectively  however  these costs increased to of our total costs of goods sold during the second half of as energy costs increased and as some of our previously hedged gas positions expired at lower costs 
given our existing hedged position and current market dynamics  we expect to continue to experience somewhat higher natural gas costs  however  we have experienced a moderation in the costs from the highs realized in the third quarter of  and we do not expect this to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in as natural gas consumption is a much less significant component in the production of steel through electric arc furnace operations  such as ours  than in traditional steel manufacturing blast furnace operations 
flat roll hot band pickled oiled cold rolled cold rolled galvanized hot rolled galvanized post anneal painted structural wide flange beams h piling bar sbq merchant shapes rail industrial fabrication joist  girders decking alternative iron units liquid briquette iron indicates shipments of less than metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our most significant manufacturing cost 
our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed decreased during as compared to historically our metallic raw material costs represented between and of our total manufacturing costs  however  during the last two years this percentage has increased to and during and  respectively  as the industry has experienced historically high steel scrap prices 
this increase in the cost of our primary raw material as a percentage of our total manufacturing costs necessitated the initiation of a surcharge mechanism which was adopted by the steel industry during the first quarter of the surcharge is derived from an indexed scrap number and designed to pass some of the increased costs associated with rising metallic prices to our customers 
as these costs decrease  the surcharge also declines 
during a portion of the second and third quarters of  steel scrap prices were below the indexed surcharge numbers  and in some instances  no surcharge was utilized in determining prices for our products 
during the fourth quarter of  our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed increased as compared to the third quarter  and surcharges were utilized 
we anticipate relatively flat metallic raw material consumption costs during the first quarter of on a linked quarter comparison 
graphic selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
our total selling  general and administrative expenses represented and of net sales  during and  respectively 
included in our selling  general and administrative expenses are costs related to our performance based profit sharing plan  which is based on of pretax earnings  and totaled million and million during and  respectively 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense decreased million  or  to million  and capitalized interest decreased million to  as compared to this decrease in gross interest expense was the result of interest expense of million that was recorded during in conjunction with a one time short term us treasury bond transaction 
the interest capitalization that occurred during these periods resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products division and structural rail division 
we currently anticipate gross interest expense to remain relatively consistent with levels throughout the next twelve months 
other income expense 
other income was million during  as compared to million during during the third quarter of  we recorded gains of million from the sale of certain equity securities 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a short term us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains 
this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter  and we recorded associated gains of million during income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during the same period in our effective income tax rate was increased to for the second half of due to increased profitability 
we further increased our effective income tax rate to beginning january  in anticipation of the year s expected profitability levels and the resulting impact to our state income taxes 
we currently expect the effective income tax rate to remain at for operating results vs 
net income was million or per diluted shared during  compared with million or 
per diluted share during this increase in our net income during was due to increased selling values and shipping volumes 
gross profit 
during  our net sales increased billion  or  to billion  and our consolidated shipments increased  tons  or  to million tons  compared with the increase in consolidated shipments was primarily due to increased shipments to external customers of  tons from our bar products division  which started commercial operations during the first quarter of  and an increase of  tons from our structural and rail division  which completed its second full year of operations 
our average consolidated selling price for increased to per ton compared with we experienced an increase in demand and product base pricing during  however  our increase in selling values during that time was also due in part to the steel industry s initiation of a surcharge mechanism at the beginning of this surcharge is derived from an indexed scrap number and designed to pass some of the increased costs associated with rising metallic prices through to the industry s customers 
our average annual metallic raw material cost per net ton charged increased when compared with metallic raw materials  specifically steel scrap and scrap substitutes  represent the most significant cost component of our steel operation s production processes 
as a percentage of total costs of goods sold during  these costs represented  an increase of compared with this increase in the cost of our primary raw material as a percentage of our total manufacturing costs necessitated the surcharge 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million during  as compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributed to increased profit sharing and bonus compensation expense of million  which correlates to the increase in our pretax earnings 
our profit sharing pool is calculated as a percentage of our pretax earnings 
during  and the first half of  the profit sharing pool was based on of pretax earnings 
during the second half of  upon approval of our board of directors  the allocation was increased to 
during and  selling general and administrative expense represented of net sales 
interest expense 
during  gross interest expense increased to million and capitalized interest decreased  to million  as compared to during  we recorded interest expense of million in conjunction with a one time short term us treasury bond transaction 
the interest capitalization that occurred during resulted from the interest required to be capitalized with respect to construction activities at our bar products and structural and rail divisions 
other income expense 
other income was million during  as compared to other expense of  during during the first quarter of  we entered into a short term us treasury bond transaction to generate net interest income in an increasing interest rate environment and to generate capital gains 
this transaction was completed during the fourth quarter and we recorded associated gains of million during we also recorded a million gain from the early extinguishment of debt associated with our structural and rail division during the second quarter of income taxes 
during  our income tax provision was million  as compared to million during our effective income tax rate was throughout and for the first half of we fully utilized all of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards during we increased our effective income tax rate to effective july  due to increased profitability during the year 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our steelmaking and finishing operations and to remain in compliance with environmental laws 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity  long term borrowings  state and local grants and capital cost reimbursements 
working capital 
during  our operational working capital position  representing our cash invested in trade receivables and inventories less trade payables and accruals increased million to million compared to december  due to decreased selling prices  trade receivables decreased million  or  during to million  of which were current or less than days past due 
our largest customer is an affiliated company  heidtman steel  which represented and of our outstanding trade receivables at december  and  respectively 
during  our inventories increased million  or  to million 
raw materials and supplies increased million  while finished goods inventories decreased million 
the increase in raw material and supplies was driven by the increased costs and volumes of alloys required as product diversification increases at our bar products division and by the addition of inventories at our new millennium lake city  florida plant  which began operations during the first quarter of the decrease in our finished goods inventories resulted from record shipments at our structural rail division which reduced finished goods inventories by  tons  or  during our trade payables and accruals decreased million  or  during  due to the timing of funding certain payables 
capital expenditures 
during  we invested million in property  plant and equipment  of which million  or  related to the expansion of our joist and deck operations  and the remainder represented improvement projects for our existing facilities 
we believe these capital investments will increase our net sales and related cash flows as each project develops 
capital resources 
during  our total outstanding debt  including unamortized bond premium  decreased million to million 
our long term debt to capitalization ratio  representing our long term debt divided by the sum of our long term debt and our total stockholders equity  was and at december  and  respectively 
long term debt 
on september   we replaced our million year revolving credit facility with a new year million senior secured revolving credit facility  which includes a provision to increase the new facility by as much as million under certain circumstances 
the proceeds from the revolver will be available for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including merger and acquisition activity 
as a result of this refinancing  we expensed million of previously capitalized financing costs associated with the refinanced debt and capitalized million in costs associated with the new facility 
at december  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under the then existing revolving credit facilities 
the senior secured credit agreement is secured by substantially all of our and our wholly owned subsidiaries receivables and inventories and by pledges of all shares of capital stock and inter company debt held by us and each of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the senior secured credit agreement contains financial covenants and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  enter into transactions with affiliates  make restricted payments or investments  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities 
our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial covenants and other covenants contained in the senior secured credit agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december   and expect to remain in compliance during the next twelve months 
due to the increasing interest rate environment during and anticipated in  we entered into three forward interest rate agreements during to lock the six month libor in arrears setting of our million fair value interest rate swap through march  we recorded gains of million during as a result of these contracts being recorded at fair market value 
at december   one forward interest rate agreement remained in place locking the six month libor in arrears setting at through march  share repurchases 
on april   we announced the approval of our board of directors to increase the shares available for the company to repurchase from million shares to million shares pursuant to the share repurchase program 
at september   we had repurchased the entire million shares  of which million shares were purchased during  pursuant to the program  in the open market at an average price of per share 
announced merger 
on october   we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to merge with roanoke electric steel corporation 
pursuant to the merger agreement  roanoke stockholders will receive a fixed consideration equal to 
shares of our common stock plus in cash for each share of roanoke stock outstanding at the effective date of the merger 
at february   roanoke had  shares outstanding 
we plan to use current cash reserves to fund the cash portion of this acquisition 
completion of the merger is subject to roanoke stockholder approvals  certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions 
the definitive merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both parties  including a provision for a termination fee of million plus expenses to be paid to us if the transaction is terminated under certain circumstances 
roanoke has steel manufacturing facilities in roanoke  virginia and huntington  west virginia 
these facilities produce angles  rounds  flats  channels  beams  special sections and billets  which are sold to steel service centers  fabricators  original equipment manufacturers and other steel producers 
roanoke also has subsidiaries involved in steel fabrication  including steel joist and truck trailer beams  and has two steel scrap processing locations 
other 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which  in turn  will depend upon general economic  financial and business conditions  along with competition  legislation and regulation factors that are largely beyond our control 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our operating results  cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future 
we believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds  including additional borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement  will be adequate for the next two years for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  funding working capital requirements and funding anticipated capital expenditures 
during  we currently anticipate spending approximately million on capital improvement projects at our existing facilities and on  among others  the following capital projects approximately million in connection with an addition of a paint line at our jeffersonville galvanizing facility  million in connection with construction of a bar finishing facility at our bar products division  million in connection with construction of a rail welding facility at our structural and rail division  and million of various smaller individual projects at our existing operations 
these amounts do not include capital requirements that may arise from our involvement in new joint ventures or merger and acquisition activity that may occur throughout the year 
during  we received benefits from state and local governments in the form of real estate and personal property tax abatements and credits of approximately million 
based on our current abatements and incentive credits  and utilizing our existing long lived asset structure  we estimate the remaining annual effect on future operations to be approximately million  million  million  million  million  million  million   and  during the years through  respectively 
contractual obligations and other long term liabilities we have the following minimum commitments under contractual obligations  including purchase obligations  as defined by the us securities and exchange commission 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
other long term liabilities are defined as long term liabilities that are reflected on our balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
based on this definition  the following table includes only those contracts which include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
the following table provides aggregated information about outstanding contractual obligations and other long term liabilities as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total after long term debt estimated interest payments on debt and interest rate swap payments purchase obligations construction commitments total the long term debt payment information presented above assumes that our senior unsecured notes and our convertible subordinated notes remain outstanding until maturity 
the earliest dates at which redemption or repurchase may occur for our million senior unsecured notes is march  and for our million convertible subordinated notes is december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our long term debt 
the estimated interest payments shown above assume interest rates of on our million senior unsecured notes due march   on our million convertible subordinated notes due december   and on our other fixed rate debt of approximately million 
purchase obligations include commitments we have for the purchase of natural gas and its transportation to be utilized within our production process 
these arrangements have take or pay or other similar commitment provisions 
we have fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years under these contracts 
construction commitments relate to firm contracts we have with various vendors for the completion of certain construction projects at our various divisions at december  other matters inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
environmental and other contingencies we have incurred  and in the future will continue to incur  capital expenditures and operating expenses for matters relating to environmental control  remediation  monitoring and compliance 
during  we incurred costs related to the monitoring and compliance of environmental matters in the amount of million and capital expenditures related to environmental compliance of  approximately of the costs incurred during for monitoring and compliance were related to the normal transportation of certain types of waste produced in the steelmaking process in accordance with legal requirements 
no environmental remediation costs were incurred during  and there were no outstanding contingent matters related to environmental remediation  therefore  there were no related accruals recorded at december  we believe  apart from our dependence on environmental construction and operating permits for our existing and proposed manufacturing facilities  that compliance with current environmental laws and regulations is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  however  environmental laws and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years  and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments in note to our consolidated financial statements  we discuss new accounting policies adopted by steel dynamics during and the expected financial impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r fas r  share based payments 
fas r requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as our employee stock option plans  as an expense in the financial statements 
based on our preliminary research and evaluations  we believe that our adoption of fas r on january   will result in a reduction of first quarter net earnings by approximately  or 
per diluted share 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate the appropriateness of these estimations and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we recognize revenues from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales when the title of the product transfers upon shipment 
provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience 
if the historical data used in our estimates does not reflect future returns and claims trends  additional provision may be necessary 
our steel joist and steel decking operation  new millennium building systems  recognizes revenues from construction contracts on a percentage of completion method based on steel consumed to date as a percentage of the estimated total steel required for each contract 
new millennium accounted for of our net sales 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by our customers  which are principally intermediate steel processors and service centers that sell our products to numerous industry sectors  including the automotive  construction  commercial  transportation and industrial machinery markets 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on known credit risks  historical loss experience and current economic conditions affecting our customers 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations and taking further action when necessary  such as requiring letters of credit or other security interests to support the receivable from our customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowance may be required 
impairments of long lived assets 
in accordance with the methodology described in fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we are required to estimate our income taxes as a part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to interest rate changes 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings 
we generally maintain fixed rate debt as a percentage of our net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage 
a portion of our debt has an interest component that resets on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the following table represents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date for our long term debt as of december  in thousands interest rate risk fixed rate variable rate expected maturity date principal average rate principal average rate thereafter total fair value commodity risk in the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of steel products and to the purchase of commodities used in our production process  such as metallic raw materials  electricity  natural gas and alloys 
our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand 
during  approximately of our net sales were under fixed price contracts with greater than twelve month commitments 
our risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within our production process has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities 
certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for periods of up to years 
during the years ending december   and  we have commitments for natural gas and its transportation with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we fully utilized all such take or pay requirements during the past three years and purchased million  million and million  during the years ended december   and  respectively  under these contracts 
we believe that our production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
we also purchase electricity consumed at our flat roll division pursuant to a contract which extends through december the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement
