item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we operate primarily through three business segments the companion animal group cag  water testing business water and the food diagnostics group fdg 
cag is comprised of the following product and service categories instruments and consumables  rapid assays  reference laboratory and consulting services  practice information management and digital radiography systems  and pharmaceuticals 
water develops  designs  manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water 
fdg develops  designs  manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and dairy products 
other items that are not included in our reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development and interest income 
for the three years ended december   revenues by product and service categories were as follows in thousands december  cag revenue instruments and consumables    rapid assay products    reference laboratory and consulting services   practice information management and digital radiography systems    pharmaceutical products    net cag revenue    net water revenue    fdg revenue production animal products    dairy testing products    net fdg revenue    net revenue    the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 
companion animal group in the cag segment  we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings 
the breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution  permits us to offer integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point of care and outside laboratory testing  and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting practice information software systems  including connecting the electronic health record with laboratory test data  in clinic test data from our idexx vetlab suite of analyzers  and radiographic data in the idexx pacs software taken by our digital radiography systems 
in the us  we sell instrument consumables  rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily through distributors  and  therefore  our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors  rather than sales to veterinarians  the end users 
because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate  sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product 
therefore  we closely track sales of these products by our us distributors to the veterinarians practice level sales  which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products 
in the discussion of results below  we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced  positively or negatively  by changes in distributor inventories 
instruments and consumables 
our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that  individually and together  provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic  enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and  in doing so  achieve their practice objectives  including growth and economic success 
we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments 
during the early stage of an instrument s life cycle  we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements  while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline 
we have a large installed base of vettest chemistry analyzers  and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales  although in recent years we have grown the annual number of unit instrument placements through sales  lease  rental and other programs 
our long term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition  customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments 
to increase utilization  we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 
we purchase the consumables used in vettest chemistry analyzers from ortho under a supply agreement that continues through this supply agreement provides us with a long term source of slides at costs that improve annually through  and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume 
under this agreement  we are developing and expect to introduce a next generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the ortho dry slide technology  and ortho will supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the vettest chemistry analyzer 
we do not expect this next generation analyzer to be commercially available before the latter part of in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the lasercyte hematology analyzer  which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform  the vetautoread hematology analyzer 
a substantial portion of lasercyte placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our vetautoread hematology analyzers 
although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables  lasercyte consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of vetautoread consumables 
because the gross margin percentage of lasercyte consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the vetautoread consumables  gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the lasercyte hematology analyzer 
our gross margins on lasercyte hematology analyzer sales have been low in the early years of the program due to higher manufacturing  service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer 
as we have gained experience with the analyzer  we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs  which have improved gross margins on these products  particularly in while we expect that lasercyte gross margins will continue to improve  they will continue to have a negative impact on overall cag gross margins 
with all of our instrument lines  we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of diagnostic menu  flexibility of menu selection  accuracy  reliability  ease of use  ability to handle compromised samples  time to result  analytical capability of software  integration with the idexx vetlab system  education and training  and superior sales and customer service 
our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy 
rapid assays 
our rapid assay business comprises single use kits for in clinic testing and microwell based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions 
our rapid assay strategy is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs 
as in our other lines of business  we also seek to differentiate our products through superior sales and customer service 
these products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities  and which we believe do not include a similar level of support 
we augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 
reference laboratory and consulting services 
we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx reference laboratories 
we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality  customer service  technology employed and specialized test menu 
revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers  including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories 
in  we acquired a laboratory in columbus  ohio  opened a laboratory in seattle  washington  and acquired vet med lab  which is based in germany and is the largest european veterinary reference laboratory 
in  we acquired laboratories in switzerland  the united kingdom  and france and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the us and germany 
profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements 
new laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability 
acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements 
therefore  in the short term  new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business 
practice information management and digital radiography systems 
these businesses consist of veterinary practice information management systems pims including hardware and software and veterinary specific digital radiography systems 
our strategy in the pims business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions  backed by superior customer support and education  to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice s business objectives 
we differentiate our software systems through continually enhanced functionality through regular software releases 
our veterinary specific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals 
the digital radiography systems also incorporate idexx pacs picture archiving and communication software developed by idexx that allows for image enhancement  manipulation  storage and retrieval  and integration with the practice information software 
our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price  backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the companion animal group 
water our strategy in the water testing business is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary products with superior performance  supported by exceptional customer service 
our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important 
over the past several years  the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration 
international sales of water testing products represented of total water product sales in  and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales 
growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line 
most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation  and  in many countries  a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body 
as a result  we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries  primarily in europe 
food diagnostics group production animal services 
we develop  manufacture  market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry  cattle and swine diseases and conditions  and have an active research and development and in licensing program in this area 
our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics 
disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable  and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated 
in response to outbreaks  testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods 
conversely  successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products 
the performance of this business  therefore  can be subject to fluctuation 
in  approximately of our sales in this business was international 
because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales  the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 
in  we received usda approval of our postmortem test for bse mad cow disease and  in february  we were informed that this test was approved by the european commission for sale in eu member countries 
while bse testing is very limited in the us  a larger market for bse testing exists in europe 
dairy testing 
our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop  manufacture and sell antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance 
these testing products use  almost exclusively  the snap platform and manufacturing processes of our rapid assay business  incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection 
sales of dairy testing products have declined slightly over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market 
to increase sales of dairy testing products  we look to increase penetration in geographies outside the united states and in the farm segment of the dairy market  and to develop product line enhancements and extensions 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets  warranty reserves  income taxes  contingencies  and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this form k describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on results of operations 
certain major components of inventory are discussed in more detail below 
lasercyte hematology analyzer 
at december  and  our net inventories included million and million  respectively  of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument 
in addition  we had firm purchase commitments for an additional million of component parts as of december  at december  and  million and million of the net lasercyte inventory  respectively  required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods 
at december  and  the inventory subject to rework was net of million and million write downs  respectively  for inventory estimated to be obsolete 
we expect to fully realize our net investment in inventory and purchase commitments 
however  if we alter the design of this product  we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory 
vettest chemistry slides 
at december  and  our net inventories included million and million  respectively  of slides used in our vettest chemistry analyzers 
the decrease in slide inventory at december   compared to december   was primarily due to the delay of inventory receipts from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of most of the slides have a shelf life of months at the date of manufacture 
the average remaining shelf life at december  was months 
in addition  we are required to purchase a minimum of million of slides from ortho through december  during the quarter ended december   we entered into a new contract with ortho  which extended the term of the supply agreement through and left the contract minimum purchase commitments unchanged 
in june  we further amended this agreement to  among other things  extend its term from to as a result of the current and projected demand for vettest slides  our commitment to develop a next generation chemistry analyzer that will utilize these slides  and the ratable decrease in required annual slide purchases from ortho through  we believe that we will not incur a loss under the contract 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this form k for additional discussion of our development commitment 
nitazoxanide 
our nitazoxanide product  navigator  for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis epm was approved by the fda in november at december   our inventories included million of inventory associated with navigator  consisting of million of finished goods and million of active ingredient and other raw materials 
in december  we entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which we paid the supplier million in january and the supplier agreed until to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longer dated material 
the payment was capitalized as inventory cost 
we believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets  other than goodwill  are valued at fair value when acquired 
if a market value is not readily available  the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on expected cash flows of the associated business acquired that are attributable to the intangible asset 
goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the other net assets acquired 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  failure to obtain regulatory approval of certain products  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant advancements or changes in technology  and cancellation or significant changes in contractual relationships 
we continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

if an impairment review is triggered  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
in determining expected future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups 
the cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we are required to perform annual tests of goodwill for impairment or additional tests whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
for our annual impairment tests  we identify our reporting units  allocate assets and liabilities including goodwill to the reporting units and compare the reporting units net book value to their estimated fair value 
the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
the cash flow estimates used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if a reporting unit s net book value exceeds its fair value  then the implied fair value of goodwill is determined 
if the net book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
no impairment has been identified as a result of the annual reviews 
warranty reserves we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue at the time revenue is recognized 
our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates  which are based on historical data  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
at december  and  we had accrued million and million for estimated warranty expense  respectively  including warranty reserves of million and million  respectively  for lasercyte hematology analyzers 
warranty expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in the warranty liability during  compared to  was due to the improved reliability of the lasercyte hematology analyzer  partially offset by the impact of the growing installed base of lasercyte hematology analyzers 
the increase in warranty liability during compared to was due to the impact of the growing installed base of lasercyte hematology analyzers  partially offset by a reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments 
we charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period 
cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period  but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
the reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of million and million in cost of product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable  respectively  and a deferred tax liability or asset  as the case may be  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
we periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies 
any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income  respectively  in the period such determination was made 
we consider the operating earnings of non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states  the cumulative amount of which was million at december  no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of non united states subsidiaries 
during  we repatriated approximately million under the american jobs creation act of and recorded a tax provision of million related to this repatriation 
should we repatriate non united states earnings in the future  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made 
estimates for certain contingencies under our workers compensation insurance policy for us employees for the years ended december   and  we retain the first  in claim liability per incident and million  million and million  respectively  in aggregate claim liability 
we entered into a similar workers compensation insurance policy effective january  we estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims 
based on this analysis  we have recognized cumulative expenses of million  million and million for claims incurred during the years ended december   and  respectively 
under our employee health care insurance policy  we retain claims liability risk up to  per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month  which was estimated to be million at december  we estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage  our claims experience  the number of employees enrolled in the program  and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported 
should actual employee health care claims liability exceed estimates  we are liable for up to an additional million for potential uninsured obligations at december  we have insurance coverage of million for claims above the aggregate limit 
should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage  we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage 
from time to time  we are notified that a claim is being made against us 
we evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim 
if warranted  we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four criteria are met 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products sold through distributors  as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery to the common carrier 
we recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered  except as noted below 
our distributors do not have the right to return products 
we recognize revenue from the sales of instruments  noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and completion of training if applicable and the customer s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no significant further obligations 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements  we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under the emerging issues task force consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers 
the deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
the delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings  which may give customers credits  award points  or trade in rights 
awards points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and or toward future purchase of our products and services 
we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years 
revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits  points actually awarded  and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue 
for the snap up the savings program  estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers 
for our practice developer volume discount program  we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures 
during  we notified customers that  effective november   unused points awarded prior to january   including points issued under the snap up the savings program  would be canceled and  that on november of each subsequent year  unused points issued prior to january of the prior year would also be canceled 
the value of points canceled in was less than million 
we may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future 
for trade in rights  we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average trade in value 
we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required

distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices  who are the end users 
distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying end user demand for our products 
fluctuations in distributors inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying end user demand 
therefore  we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of end user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth 
where growth rates are affected by changes in end user demand  we refer to the impact of practice level sales on growth 
where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics  we refer to the impact of changes in distributors inventories 
if during the comparable period of the prior year  distributors inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current year  then changes in distributors inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales in the current period 
conversely  if during the comparable period of the prior year  distributors inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year  then distributors inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales in the current period 
the increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to increased sales volume 
the increased sales volume of consumables was due primarily to higher worldwide practice level sales of vettest slides 
to a lesser extent  increased domestic sales of consumables used with our vetlyte electrolyte analyzers and higher practice level sales of tubes used with our hematology instruments also resulted in increased sales volume of consumables 
increased vettest chemistry and hematology consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments throughout and the increase in sales of vetlyte consumables was due  in part  to lower sales in the fourth quarter of due to product unavailability  which had a favorable impact of on the growth rate for instruments and consumables during increased instrument sales volume resulted mainly from higher sales of lasercyte hematology analyzers and  to a lesser extent  the launch of our vetstat electrolyte and blood gas analyzer 
the increase in sales of rapid assay products was due primarily to increased domestic practice level sales volume of our canine combination test  the snap dx canine test  and to higher average unit sales prices for canine and feline products 
the increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of and in and  to a lesser extent  the impact of price increases and higher testing volume 
incremental sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of and in contributed approximately to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth during the increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems resulted from increased sales volume of digital radiography instruments 
the increase in digital radiography revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems sold  including sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of incremental sales from this acquired business contributed approximately to practice information management and digital radiography systems revenue growth during the increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from increased practice level demand and  to a lesser extent  from price increases on certain products 
we expect pharmaceutical revenue for  as a percentage of revenue  to grow at a lower rate of to 
water 
revenue for water increased million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
the increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide sales volume  partly offset by lower average unit sales prices attributable to both greater price competition in certain geographies and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices 
the favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of million  or less than  to the increase in water revenue

the decrease in sales of dairy testing products resulted primarily from the divestiture of the parallux product line and from lower average unit sales prices attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices 
these decreases were partially offset by higher unit sales of snap tests 
gross profit total company

r  share based payment and will expense share based compensation beginning on january   which will have a negative impact on our future gross profit percentages and on operating margins for all of our segments 
companion animal group 
gross profit for cag increased million  or  to million from million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the cag product lines 
as a percentage of revenue  cag gross profit was approximately constant at 
the gross profit percentage was positively impacted by relatively higher selling prices  particularly for laboratory and consulting services and rapid assay products  lower product and service costs associated with the lasercyte hematology analyzer and lower product cost of slides sold for use in our vettest chemistry analyzers under the agreement with our supplier  and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies  net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 
the increases in the gross profit percentage were largely offset by higher overall net product and service costs  apart from the favorable lasercyte and slide costs mentioned above  greater relative sales of lower margin products and services  mainly from higher sales growth of laboratory services  and write downs of excess pharmaceutical product inventory 
water 
gross profit for water increased million  or  to million from million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume  partly offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage to from 
the gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by costs related to a manufacturing issue during the third quarter of and by lower average unit sales prices 
these decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies  net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses 
food diagnostics group 
gross profit for fdg increased million  or  to million from million for the prior year due to increased sales volume  partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to from 
during the same period of the prior year  a reduction of approximately million in an estimated liability for a third party claim was accounted for as a reduction in cost of revenue and increased the gross profit percentage by four percentage points 
for  an unfavorable impact on the gross margin percentage of two percentage points was attributable to incremental acquisition integration costs 
the gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products and by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies  net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses  partially offset by higher net product costs 
operating expenses and operating income total company 
total operating expenses increased million to million from million for the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  operating expenses increased to from for the prior year 
operating income increased million to million from million for the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  operating income decreased to from 
during  operating income was reduced by acquisition integration costs associated with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of and in  including costs incurred in connection with the centralization of our european production animal diagnostics operations in bern  switzerland

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we operate subsidiaries in foreign countries and transact business in local currencies 
we attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than months 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals  as appropriate  and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods 
our hedging strategy provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year  which is complete by the end of the preceding year 
quarterly  we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following twelve months 
accordingly  our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle 
at december   we had million in net unrealized gains on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income  which is net of million in taxes 
our currency rate exposure at december  consisted of local currency revenues and expenses  the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company s or its subsidiaries functional currency 
based on our overall currency rate exposure  excluding unrealized gains of million at december  and unrealized losses of million at december  on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately million for and a strengthening of the us dollar from december  would have reduced operating income for by approximately million 
a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies at december  would increase operating income by approximately million in a weakening of the us dollar from december  would have increased operating income by approximately million in as of december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would reduce operating income by approximately million in  compared to million in  and the effects of a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would increase operating income by approximately million in  compared to million in
