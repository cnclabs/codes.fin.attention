item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our condensed consolidated financial statements and results appearing elsewhere in this report 
throughout this section  we make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of you can often identify these and other forward looking statements by terms such as becoming  may  will  should  predicts  potential  continue  anticipates  believes  estimates  seeks  expects  plans  intends  or comparable terminology 
these forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  our expectations about revenue and various operating expenses 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  and we have based these expectations on our beliefs and assumptions  such expectations may prove to be incorrect 
our actual results of operations and financial performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to competition in the eda market  magma s ability to integrate acquired businesses and technologies  potentially higher than anticipated costs of litigation  uncertain outcome of synopsys litigation  potentially higher than anticipated costs of compliance with regulatory requirements  including those relating to internal control over financial reporting  any delay of customer orders or failure of customers to renew licenses  adoption of products by customers  weaker than anticipated sales of magma s products and services  weakness in the semiconductor or electronic systems industries  the ability to manage expanding operations  the ability to attract and retain the key management and technical personnel needed to operate magma successfully  the ability to continue to deliver competitive products to customers  and changes in accounting rules 
magma undertakes no additional obligation to update these forward looking statements 
executive summary magma design automation provides eda software products and related services 
our software enables chip designers to reduce the time it takes to design and produce complex integrated circuits used in the communications  computing  consumer electronics  networking and semiconductor industries 
our products are used in all major phases of the chip development cycle  from initial design through physical implementation 
our focus is on software used to design the most technologically advanced integrated circuits  specifically those with minimum feature sizes of micron and smaller 
see item  business for a more complete description of our business 
as an eda software provider  we generate substantially all our revenue from the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their research and development budgets 
as a result  our revenue is heavily influenced by our customers long term business outlook and willingness to invest in new chip designs 
the semiconductor industry is highly volatile and cost sensitive 
our customers focus on controlling costs and reducing risk  lowering research and development r d expenditures  cutting back on design starts  purchasing 
table of contents from fewer suppliers  and requiring more favorable pricing and payment terms from suppliers 
in addition  intense competition among suppliers of eda products has resulted in pricing pressure on eda products 
to support our customers  we have focused on providing the most technologically advanced products to address each step in the ic design process  as well as integrating these products into broad platforms  and expanding our product offerings 
our goal is to be the eda technology supplier of choice for our customers as they pursue longer term  broader and more flexible relationships with fewer suppliers 
our accomplishments during fiscal include we continued to penetrate our market  and during fiscal we added new customers and now have approximately customers 
we successfully completed three transactions during fiscal to broaden our product offerings and to incorporate key technologies into our existing products 
our total headcount increased to as of april  up from as of march  most of the additional headcount represents additions to our r d and application engineering organizations 
our investments in these organizations will enable us to continue to provide leading edge design solutions for our customers in all key areas of chip design 
revenue for fiscal was million  up percent from the prior year 
license sales for both fiscal and accounted for approximately percent of total revenue 
within the total revenue for fiscal  percent was for orders recognized on a ratable basis or due and payable or cash receipts basis  and percent was for short term time based and perpetual licenses recognized up front 
domestic sales revenue increased by million or percent in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to large orders executed during fiscal in north america 
these orders came from new customers and existing customers who extended license periods and added license capacity due to the continued proliferation of existing and new magma products  amongst their design group designers 
for fiscal  cash flows generated from operations were million  or percent of fiscal revenue 
recent acquisitions we have acquired companies and purchased technologies that enable us to expand into new markets 
we believe that these acquisitions are a significant factor in magma being able to compete successfully in the eda industry and we expect to make similar acquisitions in the future 
these acquisitions increased our headcount and increased our research and development and sales and marketing expenses 
acquisitions may decrease our liquidity in the short term if earnout milestones are achieved and we must pay contingent cash consideration under the terms of some of these acquisitions 
business combination on november   we acquired acad corporation acad  a privately held company that develops circuit simulation software  to broaden our product portfolio into simulation  addressing a new market  and to enhance certain other existing magma products  all of which help ic manufacturers produce higher quality chips more efficiently 
the acquisition of acad further supports magma s focus to deliver effective eda software to ic manufactures  enabling ic designers to meet critical time to market objectives  improve chip performance  and handle multimillion gate designs 
we acquired acad for an initial consideration of approximately  in cash and assumption of its net liabilities of approximately million 
we also agreed to pay up to million of cash in contingent consideration to the acad shareholders upon achieving or exceeding certain financial and technical milestones 
as of april  none of the contingent consideration has been earned 

table of contents asset purchases on march   we acquired certain patents and intellectual property of reshape  inc reshape  a privately held developer of eda and design flow technology 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we paid reshape total consideration of  in cash upon close of the transaction 
on june   we acquired a technology license from international business machines corporation ibm to copyrighted material pertinent to technology relating to electronic design automation  as well as other intellectual property owned by ibm 
also in connection with the technology license agreement  ibm and magma entered into an amendment extending to the term of magma s patent license agreement with ibm dated march  these two licenses cover ibm s patents and significant technology with respect to the development of eda tools and products that perform physical implementation 
the total fee for the licenses was million paid on june  in connection with the license agreements  we also entered into a warrant agreement pursuant to which ibm is entitled to purchase up to  shares of magma common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable immediately and expires on the earlier of june  or immediately prior to a change of control of magma 
the warrant may be exercised by payment of the exercise price in cash or pursuant to a cashless net exercise provision 
the fair value was estimated to be million in total for the common stock warrant 
during fiscal  a total of million of contingent cash consideration was earned on the achievement of certain technology milestones as outlined in various prior asset purchase and business combination agreements with mojave  aplus  lemmatis and pdat  of which million  net of deferred compensation and forfeitures  remains payable as of april  critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the most significant potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we consider the following accounting policies related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  asset purchases and business combinations  income taxes and valuation of long lived assets to be our most critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  as modified by sop  which generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on evidence that is specific to us 
if evidence of fair value does not exist for each element of a license arrangement and maintenance is the only undelivered element  then all revenue for the license arrangement is recognized over the term of the agreement 
if evidence of fair value does exist for the elements that have not been delivered  but does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which recognition of revenue for the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual license fee is recognized as revenue immediately 
our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements on this form k 
management has made significant judgments related to revenue recognition  specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature we must evaluate whether our fee is fixed or determinable and we must assess whether collectibility is probable 
these judgments are discussed below 

table of contents the fee is fixed or determinable 
with respect to each arrangement  we must make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is fixed or determinable  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of software assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each period subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized ratably 
except in cases where we grant extended payment terms to a specific customer  we have determined that our fees are fixed or determinable at the inception of our arrangements based on the following the fee our customers pay for our products is negotiated at the outset of an arrangement and is generally based on the specific volume of products to be delivered 
our license fees are not a function of variable pricing mechanisms such as the number of units distributed or copied by the customer or the expected number of users of the product delivered 
in order for an arrangement to be considered fixed or determinable  of the arrangement fee must be due within one year or less from the order date 
we have a history of collecting fees on such arrangements according to contractual terms 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond months are considered not to be fixed or determinable 
collectibility is probable 
in order to recognize revenue  we must make a judgment about the collectibility of the arrangement fee 
our judgment of the collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial positions and ability to pay 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash receipts basis as each payment is collected 
license revenue we derive license revenue primarily from licenses of our design and implementation software and  to a much lesser extent  from licenses of our analysis and verification products 
we license our products under time based and perpetual licenses 
we recognize license revenue after the execution of a license agreement and the delivery of the product to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties surrounding the product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  collection is probable and there are no remaining obligations other than maintenance 
for licenses where we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe for maintenance  we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
for these licenses  license revenue is recognized in the period in which the license agreement is executed assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for licenses where we have no vsoe for maintenance  we recognize license revenue ratably over the maintenance period  or if extended payment terms exist  based on the amounts due and payable 
for transactions in which we bundle maintenance for the entire license term into a time based license agreement  no vsoe of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement 
for these agreements  where the only undelivered element is maintenance  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms that is  where payment for less than of the license  services and initial post contract support is due within one year of the contract date we recognize revenue to the extent of the lesser of the portion of the amount due and payable or the ratable portion of the entire fee 
for our perpetual licenses and some time based license arrangements  we unbundle maintenance by including maintenance for up to the first year of the license term  with maintenance thereafter renewable by the customer at the substantive rates stated in their agreements with us 
in these unbundled licenses  the aggregate 
table of contents renewal period is greater than or equal to the initial maintenance period 
the stated rate for maintenance renewal in these contracts is vsoe of the fair value of maintenance in both our unbundled time based and perpetual licenses 
where the only undelivered element is maintenance  we recognize license revenue using the residual method 
if an arrangement involves extended payment terms  revenue recognized using the residual method is limited to amounts due and payable 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts invoiced relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from consulting and training for our software products and from maintenance fees for our products 
most of our license agreements include maintenance  generally for a one year period  renewable annually 
services revenue from maintenance arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the maintenance term 
because we have vsoe of fair value for consulting and training services  revenue is recognized as these services are performed or completed 
our consulting and training services are generally not essential to the functionality of the software 
our products are fully functional upon delivery of the product 
additional factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include  but are not limited to degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on our ability to recognize the software license fee 
unbilled accounts receivable unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of being invoiced to the customer 
in all cases  the revenue and unbilled receivables are for contracts which are non cancelable  there are no contingencies and where the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
we typically generate invoices days in advance of contractual due dates  and we invoice the entire amount of the unbilled accounts receivable within one year from the contract inception 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is appropriate using the factors described above 
we also monitor our accounts receivable for concentration in any one customer  industry or geographic region 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
if actual losses are significantly greater than the allowance we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reported net loss 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our allowance  this would decrease our general and administrative expenses and our reported net income would increase 
accounting for asset purchases and business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired assets and business combinations to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 

table of contents critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts  acquired workforce and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulting in changes in the purchase price allocation 
goodwill impairment statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of the reporting units 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for the reporting unit 
any impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of intangibles and long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that we record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based on the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many factors 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the amount of income taxes we pay could be subject to audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed adjustments 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  we cannot guarantee that the final outcome of these tax matters will be no different than what has been reflected in our historical income tax provisions 
we also assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize the deferred tax assets  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
future increases or decreases in our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

table of contents strategic investments in privately held companies our strategic equity investments consist of preferred stock and convertible notes that are convertible into preferred or common stock of several privately held companies 
as of april   million of the notes has been converted into an investee company s preferred stock 
the carrying value of our portfolio of strategic equity investments in non marketable equity securities privately held companies and convertible notes totaled million at april  our ability to recover our investments in private  non marketable equity securities and convertible notes  and to earn a return on these investments is primarily dependent on how successfully these companies are able to execute on their business plans and how well their products are accepted  as well as their ability to obtain additional capital funding to continue operations 
in the current equity market environment  their ability to obtain additional funding as well as to take advantage of liquidity events  such as initial public offerings  mergers and private sales  may be significantly constrained 
under our accounting policy  the carrying value of a non marketable investment is the amount paid for the investment unless it has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its estimated fair value 
for equity investments where our ownership interest is between to  we record our share of net equity income loss of the investee based on our proportionate ownership 
we review all of our investments periodically for impairment  however  for non marketable equity securities  the fair value analysis requires significant judgment 
this analysis includes assessment of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and technology  its projected results and cash flows  the likelihood of obtaining subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual equity preferences held by us or others 
if an investee obtains additional funding at a valuation lower than our carrying amount  we presume that the investment is other than temporarily impaired  unless specific facts and circumstances indicate otherwise  such as when we hold contractual rights that give us a preference over the rights of other investors 
as the equity markets have declined significantly over the past few years  we have experienced substantial impairments in our portfolio of non marketable equity securities 
if equity market conditions do not improve  as companies within our portfolio attempt to raise additional funds  the funds may not be available to them  or they may receive lower valuations  with more onerous investment terms than in previous financings  and the investments will likely become impaired 
however  we are not able to determine at the present time which specific investments are likely to be impaired in the future  or the extent or timing of individual impairments 
we recorded impairment charges and share of equity loss related to these non marketable equity investments of million during fiscal results of operations revenue overview revenue consists of licenses revenue and services revenue 
license revenue consists of fees for time based or perpetual licenses of our products 
services revenue consists of fees for services  such as post contract customer support pcs  customer training and consulting 
we recognize revenue based on the specific terms and conditions of the license contracts with our customer for our products and services as described in detail above in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for management reporting and analysis purposes we classify our revenue into the following four categories ratable due payable cash receipts turns or up front perpetual or time based we classify our license arrangements as either bundled or unbundled 
bundled license contracts include maintenance with the license fee and do not include optional maintenance periods 
unbundled license contracts have separate maintenance fees and include optional maintenance periods 

table of contents we use this classification of license revenue to provide greater insight into the reporting and monitoring of trends in the components of our revenue and to assist us in managing our business 
it is important to note that the characterization of an individual contract may change over time 
for example  a contract originally characterized as ratable may be redefined as cash receipts if that customer has difficulty in making payments in a timely fashion 
in cases where a contract has been re characterized for management reporting purposes  prior periods are not restated to reflect that change 
the following table shows the breakdown of license revenue by category as defined for management reporting and analysis purposes year ended april  of revenue year ended march  of revenue revenue category licenses revenue ratable bundled and unbundled   due payable unbundled   cash receipts unbundled   turns unbundled   total licenses revenue services revenue total revenue bundled and unbundled licenses ratable 
for bundled time based licenses  we recognize license revenue ratably over the contract term  or as customer payments become due and payable  if less 
the revenue for these bundled arrangements for both license and maintenance is classified as license revenue in our statement of operations 
for unbundled time based with a term of less than months  we recognize license revenue ratably over the license term  or as customer payments become due and payable  if earlier 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to both these types of licenses generally as ratable and we generally refer to all time based licenses recognized on a ratable basis as long term  independent of the actual length of term of the license 
we classify unbundled perpetual or time based licenses with a term of fifteen months or greater based on the payment term structure  as due and payable  cash receipts or turns unbundled licenses due and payable time based licenses with long term payments 
for unbundled time based licenses where the payment terms extend greater than one year from the arrangement effective date  we recognize license revenue on a due and payable basis and we recognize maintenance and services revenue ratably over the maintenance term 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license generally as due and payable long term time based licenses 
unbundled licenses cash receipts 
we recognize revenue from customers who have not met our predetermined credit criteria on a cash receipts basis to the extent that revenue has otherwise been earned 
such customers generally order short term time based licenses or separate annual maintenance 
we recognize license revenue as we receive cash payments from these customers 
maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term after the customer has remitted payment 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license revenue as cash receipts 
unbundled licenses turns perpetual license or time based licenses with short term payments 
for unbundled time based and perpetual licenses  we recognize license revenue upon shipment as long as the payment terms require the customer to pay of the license fee and the initial period of pcs within one year from the agreement date and payments are generally linear 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance term 
in all of these cases  the contracts are non cancelable  and the customer has taken delivery of both the software and the encryption key required to operate the software 
for management reporting and analysis purposes  we refer to this type of license generally as turns  where the license is either perpetual or time based 

table of contents our license revenue in any given quarter depends upon the mix and volume of perpetual or short term licenses ordered during the quarter and the amount of long term ratable or due and payable  and cash receipts license revenue recognized during the quarter 
in general  we refer to license revenue recognized from perpetual or time based licenses during the quarter as up front or turns revenue  for management reporting and analysis purposes 
all other types of revenue are generally referred to as revenue from backlog 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain mix of short term licenses 
the precise mix of orders fluctuates substantially from period to period and affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve our target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we have more than expected long term licenses or may exceed them if we have more than expected short term or perpetual licenses 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we may not meet our revenue targets as described in the risk factors under part i  item a  risk factors

table of contents revenue licenses revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to large orders executed during fiscal in north america and europe 
these orders came from new customers and existing customers who extended license periods and added license capacity due to the continued proliferation of existing and new magma products  amongst their design group designers 
the increase in domestic revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from japan in fiscal compared to fiscal one customer accounted for greater than of the revenue for both fiscal and fiscal license revenue as a percentage of revenue was fairly consistent for both fiscal and fiscal license revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to large orders executed during the fiscal periods in north america  europe and japan 
these orders came from existing customers who extended license periods and added license capacity due to the continued proliferation of existing and new magma products  principally blast fusion apx into their design groups 
one customer accounted for greater than of the revenue generated in fiscal and two customers each accounted for greater than of the revenue generated in fiscal license revenue as a percentage of revenue slightly decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in maintenance revenue 
the increase in maintenance revenue was primarily due to our large customers accelerating their deployment of our licenses and placing additional service orders 
services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our large customers accelerating their deployment of our licenses and placing additional services orders 
domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal increased from to as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to a one time  non recurring payment for the termination of an existing customer s license agreement 
the payment arose from sale of this customer s semiconductor division to a third party 
the third party  also an existing magma customer  purchased additional software licenses for use by engineers transferred in the acquisition 
the increase in domestic revenue was also due to a customer in north america purchasing additional capacity for existing licenses and licenses to new technology products during fiscal domestic revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to our existing customers in north america purchasing additional licenses and the new technology products 
domestic revenue as a percentage of total revenue slightly increased in fiscal compared to fiscal international revenue as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal decreased from to as compared to fiscal primarily due to our existing customers in japan and europe requiring less capacity for existing licenses and fewer licenses to new technology products

cost of revenue also includes personnel and related costs to provide product support  consulting services and training  as well as asset depreciation  allocated outside sale representative expenses and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
cost of revenue increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million in amortization on certain developed technologies 
the amortization on these 
table of contents developed technologies was included in operating expenses in fiscal we began recognizing revenue from products based on these developed technologies during fiscal accordingly  the amortization on these developed technologies  including additional earnouts in fiscal  was recorded as cost of revenues  instead of operating expenses  during fiscal the increase was also due to a million increase in amortization related to new developed technologies  including earnouts related to previous acquisitions  acquired during fiscal and the remaining increase in cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of personnel and related costs for application engineers that corresponded to higher consulting and maintenance activities in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million  or  in amortization of acquired developed technology and other intangible assets resulting from additional business combinations and asset acquisitions completed during fiscal and this increase was partially offset by the lower growth rate of related to payroll related expenses for application engineers

table of contents acquisitions 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was also caused by higher allocated common expenses eg  information technology and facility related expenses of million compared to fiscal the increases in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal were partially offset by a decrease in software maintenance costs of million due to the fact that a major software maintenance contract expired in the last quarter of fiscal the remainder of the fluctuation in research and development expense was accounted for by other individually insignificant items 
research and development expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in payroll related expenses of million  resulting from an approximate increase in our research and development headcount through direct hiring and business acquisitions

stock compensation expense recognized prior to adoption of sfas r using variable accounting will not be reversed upon adoption 
as prescribed by sfas r  we will be required to recognize the compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in our financial statements  using the fair value method  starting from our first fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will increase our share based compensation expense significantly  however we cannot quantify the amount of such increase at this time 
in addition  with the adoption of sfas r in the first fiscal quarter of  the deferred compensation will no longer be presented as a separate line on our statement of operations  instead  it will be reflected throughout our other operating expenses such as research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses

net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash from customers  a million decrease in payments associated with accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a million increase in cash from interest income 
these increases in cash flow were partially offset by a million increase in costs and expenses  and a million increase in payments associated with prepaid and other assets balances

the increase in cash from customers was primarily due to growth in revenue and strong cash collection during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in prepaid expenses was primarily caused by decreases in prepaid commission expense and prepaid software maintenance expense 
prepaid commission decreased during fiscal primarily due to orders recorded in fiscal of approximately million for which we paid advance commissions but where the entire order value has not been recognized as revenue in fiscal the advance commission balance decreases during years after fiscal as these orders are recognized as revenue in subsequent periods 
the payment of accrued liabilities during fiscal was primarily related to a payout of accrued bonuses during the period

table of contents million of repayment received for the notes receivable from stockholders 
these cash inflows were offset by our million repayment of notes payable to a bank and our repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million in order to minimize the dilutive effect of the debt offering 
capital resources we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure requirements in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may use cash or need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in more dilution to our existing stockholders 
financing arrangements may not be available to us  or may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
our acquisition agreements related to certain business combination and asset purchase transactions obligate us to pay certain contingent cash and stock considerations based on meeting certain booking or project milestones and continued employment 
total amounts of cash and stock contingent consideration that could be paid or issued under our acquisition agreements  assuming all contingencies are met  were million and million  respectively  as of april  the number of contingent shares to be issued depends on the market price of our common stock near when the milestones are achieved 
contractual obligations as of april   our principal commitments consisted of operating leases  with an aggregated future obligation amount of million through fiscal  for office facilities  capital leases for computer equipment  and repayment of the convertible subordinated notes of million due in fiscal although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate a substantial increase in our capital expenditures and lease commitments with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure  and personnel 
the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations at april   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations convertible subordinated notes purchase obligations total purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of april  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
in may  we repurchased  in privately negotiated transactions  an additional million face amount of the convertible subordinated notes 
the repurchase left approximately million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes outstanding 

table of contents in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
indemnification obligations we enter into standard license agreements in the ordinary course of business 
pursuant to these agreements  we agree to indemnify our customers for losses suffered or incurred by them as a result of any patent  copyright  or other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to our products 
these indemnification obligations have perpetual terms 
our normal business practice is to limit the maximum amount of indemnification to the amount received from the customer 
on occasion  the maximum amount of indemnification we may be required to make may exceed its normal business practices 
we estimate the fair value of its indemnification obligations as insignificant  based on our historical experience concerning product and patent infringement claims 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for indemnification under these agreements as of april  we have agreements whereby our officers and directors are indemnified for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have a directors and officers insurance policy that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of april  in connection with recent business acquisitions  we agreed to assume  or cause our subsidiaries to assume  indemnification obligations to the officers and directors of acquired companies 
warranties we offer our customers a warranty that our products will conform to the documentation provided with the products 
to date  there have been no payments or material costs incurred related to fulfilling these warranty obligations 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these warranties as of april  we assess the need for a warranty accrual on a quarterly basis  and there can be no guarantee that a warranty accrual will not become necessary in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term and long term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which mature within the next twenty four months 
as of april   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a  decline in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt  due to differences between market interest 
table of contents rates and rates in effect at the inception of our debt obligation 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt have no impact on our cash flows or consolidated financial statements 
credit risk we completed an offering on may  of million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due may  concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into convertible bond hedge and warrant transactions with respect to our common stock  the exposure for which is held by credit suisse first boston international 
both the bond hedge and warrant transactions may be settled at our option either in cash or net shares and expire on may  the transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes 
subject to the movement in the share price of our common stock  we could be exposed to credit risk in the settlement of these options in our favor 
based on a review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of credit suisse first boston international and its affiliates  we believe that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk arising from these option transactions 
in may and may  we repurchased million and million  respectively  face value of our convertible notes for million and million  respectively 
in doing so  we liquidated investments that generated a realized loss of approximately  and  respectively 
we believe that it was in the best interests of the stockholders to reduce the balance sheet debt despite the one time loss resulting from the liquidation of marketable securities 
our investments that matured in the months following the repurchase were reinvested in short term instruments in order to take advantage of rising short term rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we transact some portions of our business in various foreign currencies  primarily related to a portion of revenue in japan and operating expenses in europe  japan and asia pacific 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of april   we had no currency hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not currently use financial instruments to hedge revenue and operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis
