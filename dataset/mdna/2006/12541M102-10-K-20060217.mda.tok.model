item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand energy group and central hudson 
please note that the executive summary below is provided as a supplement to  and should be read together with  the remainder of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other information included in this k annual report 
executive summary business overview energy group is a holding company with four business segments central hudson s regulated electric utility business  central hudson s regulated natural gas utility business  griffith s and  prior to its merger with griffith as of december   scasco s fuel oil  propane  and motor fuels distribution business  and chec s investments in renewable energy supply  energy efficiency  an energy venture capital fund  and other investments of energy group  consisting primarily of money market investments 
central hudson contributed approximately of energy group s revenue and of its net income in  the fuel distribution segment contributed approximately of energy group s revenue and of its net income in  and the investment segment contributed less than of energy group s revenue and of its net income in energy group intends to deliver shareholder value through a consistent dividend currently per share annually and growth in earnings per share 
energy group is targeting annual growth in earnings per share  on average  over the next several years 
central hudson central hudson delivers electricity and natural gas to approximately  customers in a defined service territory in the mid hudson valley region of new york state 
central hudson was significantly transformed in by the psc s electricity industry restructuring under which formerly vertically integrated electric utilities such as central hudson divested most or all of their electric generating plants to unaffiliated parties 
since then  central hudson s earnings have been derived primarily from delivery charges levied upon end users of its electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution systems in its service territory 
central hudson continues to procure supplies of electricity and natural gas for a majority of its customers 
in doing so  central hudson recovers its actual costs through cost adjustment clauses and without deriving profits from these activities 
central hudson s delivery customers are gradually migrating to third party providers for their energy supplies  a process which central hudson is working to facilitate 
central hudson s delivery volumes have grown steadily in recent years due to the addition of new customers  particularly residential customers  as home construction in its service territory has been robust 
this is due to continued migration to central hudson s service territory  primarily from the new york city metropolitan area  and is in response to expansion of the regional economy and favorable relative housing costs 
in addition  per customer consumption of electricity and natural gas has gradually increased due to the construction of larger homes and the proliferation of end uses for electricity  such as computers and other electronic equipment 
while these favorable trends are expected to continue  they could be impacted by an economic recession  dampening of the housing market by rising interest rates  and or reduced consumption by customers in response to higher energy costs 
central hudson s rates are regulated by the psc  which is responsible for setting rates at a level that will recover the cost of providing safe and reliable service while providing a fair and reasonable return on invested capital 
central hudson has focused its management attention for many years on managing its costs and maintaining high customer satisfaction so that its costs will be fully recovered and a reasonable rate of return can be earned under applicable regulatory agreements 
central hudson has achieved substantial success through its efforts  consistently ranking as the lowest cost electric utility in new york state  and ranking in the top quartile in overall customer satisfaction among utilities in the eastern united states  as reported by jd power and associates in its electric utility residential customer satisfaction study 
in july  for the first time in over a decade  central hudson filed for a proposed increase in its electricity and natural gas delivery rates 
this proposed increase is intended to cover cumulative inflation  the cost of capital on an increasing investment base  costs of providing employee benefits  including costs deferred under the currently applicable regulatory agreement  environmental and safety compliance costs  and certain other costs 
the proposed rate increase is currently pending  with a decision by the psc anticipated in the second quarter of this decision will be a key driver of central hudson s earnings and cash flows once it goes into effect 
central hudson s sales growth and its ability to continue to effectively manage its cost of operations will also play significant roles in determining central hudson s future earnings and cash flows 
central hudson s investments in plant and equipment  to safely and reliably serve the growing demand for energy in its service territory  are expected to provide an opportunity for increased earnings over time  and are expected to provide a significant portion of energy group s earnings per share growth 
fuel distribution businesses griffith serves more than  customers in parts of connecticut  delaware  the district of columbia  maryland  massachusetts  new york  pennsylvania  virginia  and west virginia 
for the purposes of the following discussion  references to griffith should be read as applicable to both griffith and scasco for and prior periods 
griffith s business environment has recently been challenging and remains so due to high wholesale fuel oil  propane  and motor fuel prices 
these historically high wholesale prices have required significant infusions of working capital into griffith and have resulted in increased price sensitivity and conservation by griffith s customers 
despite these challenges  griffith s profitability in exceeded the level achieved in customer attrition due to price sensitivity increased in and early  but has since been curtailed  and modest account growth has resumed 
growth through acquisition of smaller companies  within or adjacent to griffith s existing delivery areas  resumed in since  griffith has acquired and integrated small fuel distribution businesses  including seven in energy group views griffith s cost management  strong customer service capabilities  and access to capital as competitive advantages that griffith will endeavor to translate into increased market share  both through internal marketing and selective acquisitions  in chec s investments and other items from time to time  chec has made investments in the competitive energy markets 
in  chec made a second renewable energy investment in a wind energy venture  this follows an investment in late in an ethanol production project that began operation as of the end of january chec continues to strive to find investments for energy group s available cash reserves and to utilize energy group s potential debt capacity by finding appropriate investments in the energy markets 
chec s approach has been cautious  both due to energy group s limited risk tolerance and strong competition from other investors 
passage of the energy act in has increased incentives to invest in certain portions of the energy markets  and certain state and federal legislative actions have increased demand for renewable energy 
chec is evaluating these opportunities but remains cautious about undue reliance on government incentives 
chec s ability to find investments that provide attractive returns with acceptable risks will be a key factor in determining whether energy group is able to achieve its goal of annual growth in earnings per share over the next several years 
chec s other investments in energy efficiency projects  a venture capital fund  and other small partnerships are not expected to play a significant role in energy group s strategy going forward 
energy group s other investments consist primarily of money market investments  income from which fluctuates with market rates of interest 
over time  energy group intends to draw down the balance of its money market portfolio  primarily for investment in its subsidiaries 
risk management energy group s common stock has historically exhibited relatively low volatility  and energy group recognizes its shareholder base as having a relatively low risk tolerance 
in view of this  energy group has an enterprise wide risk management process in place  which identifies and manages the risks inherent in energy group s businesses in a cost effective manner 
in addition to a comprehensive insurance program  energy group employs various strategies to moderate volatility in energy prices and interest rates and to reduce potential earnings volatility resulting from the effects of weather 
corporate governance energy group has embraced the corporate governance changes that have been implemented through the sarbanes oxley act of and related rulemakings by the sec and the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange 
a detailed discussion of energy group s corporate governance processes can be found in energy group s definitive proxy statement 
energy group believes that its current corporate governance processes effectively serve the interests of its shareholders 
credit quality energy group believes that creditworthiness and liquidity are important factors for its long term success 
in light of this  energy group has maintained conservative financial policies at its primary subsidiary  central hudson  which enjoys a solid a bond rating  and at griffith 
in addition  committed lines of credit of million at each of energy group and central hudson have been established to provide sufficient liquidity in the currently volatile wholesale energy markets 
in review earnings were per share basic in versus the per share basic posted during  an increase of per share 
increased investment earnings  higher energy delivery revenues  improved fuel distribution business profitability  and lower income taxes together were more than sufficient to offset higher interest rates  the expiration of incentives associated with the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets  and rising operating expenses 
regulated electric and natural gas businesses central hudson s contributions to earnings per share was  a per share reduction from however  a total of per share of regulatory incentives and revenue adjustments related to prior years were included in earnings but not in earnings due to their expiration at the end of deliveries to electric customers increased by  largely due to hotter summer weather but also due to growth in the number of customers 
deliveries to firm gas customers increased due largely to an increase in the number of customers 
fuel distribution businesses the fuel distribution businesses of chec improved their annual earnings contribution by per share to per share for the year as compared to results 
the improvement was due to an increase in margins and service profitability  as well as the addition of earnings from acquisitions made during the course of the year 
other energy group the holding company and chec s partnership and other investments contributed per share  an increase of per share from levels 
lower income taxes  increased returns on short term investments  and improved earnings from chec s other holdings contributed to the strong performance 
regulatory matters rate proceedings electric and natural gas on july   central hudson filed an application for increased electric and natural gas rates with the psc 
central hudson s current electric and natural gas delivery rates have been in effect since november   and have not been increased since and  respectively 
for further information regarding central hudson s current rate agreement and most recent electric and natural gas rate filings  see note regulatory matters under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas 
other psc proceedings stray voltage on january   the psc issued an order that requires each new york state electric utility  including central hudson  to institute a comprehensive stray voltage testing and inspection program for all of its electric facilities  with each such facility to be tested annually and inspected at least every five years 
central hudson s existing inspection program is consistent with the order s inspection requirements 
for more information regarding central hudson s stray voltage testing  see note regulatory matters under the caption other regulatory matters 
non utility land sales commencing april   central hudson filed notices of intent with the psc to sell parcels of non utility real property 
on july   the psc issued an order stating that the filings would be reviewed further under public service law section to determine the disposition of and the accounting for the potential gains 
on august   central hudson filed a petition for rehearing with the psc  requesting that the psc reconsider and find that section does not apply to transfers of non utility property under the circumstances presented in the case 
neither energy group nor central hudson can predict the outcome of these filings at this time 
electric reliability performance on september   the psc issued an order establishing an assessment with respect to electric reliability performance targets that were established in a prior rate proceeding for frequency and duration of electric service outages 
central hudson recorded amounts of  and  for failure to meet reliability targets for the years and  respectively  and also recorded an estimate of  for on october   central hudson filed a petition for rehearing with the psc that presents central hudson s position that the psc made errors of fact and law in reaching its determinations in the september  order 
neither energy group nor central hudson can predict the final outcome of this matter

results of operations the following discussion and analyses include explanations of significant changes in revenues and expenses between the twelve months ended december   and  and the twelve months ended december   and  for the regulated electric and natural gas business  the fuel distribution businesses  and the other competitive businesses 
earnings earnings per share basic and diluted of energy group s common stock are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares outstanding basic and diluted during the subject year 
the number of average shares outstanding of energy group common stock  the earnings per share  and the rate of return earned on average common equity  which is net income as a percentage of a monthly average of common equity  are as follows average shares outstanding in thousands basic    diluted    earnings per share basic diluted return earned on common equity as compared to energy group s consolidated earnings per share basic for were per share  an increase of per share basic from earnings of 
details for the change in earnings are as follows regulated electric and natural gas businesses earnings from central hudson s electric and natural gas operations decreased per share in as compared to  due to the following o a decrease of per share due to the expiration in december of the amortization of central hudson s share of the gain from the sales of its interests in its major generating assets 
o a decrease of per share due to an increase in depreciation and amortization of utility plant assets as a result of an increased balance of utility plant assets 
o a decrease of per share from electric and natural gas regulatory mechanisms 
the decrease reflects per share due to the absence in of the amortization of previously deferred electric delivery revenues and per share from the recording of psc assessments for service interruptions consistent with a psc order issued on september  these reductions in revenues were partially offset by a reduction in shared earnings from electric and natural gas operations and payments received from the nyiso related to adjustments made to energy sales transactions that had occurred in may o an increase of per share due to an increase in electric net operating revenues 
total electric deliveries increased reflecting an increase in deliveries to residential customers and a increase in deliveries to commercial customers  both attributable to increased usage due to hotter summer weather and modest customer growth 
total weather normalized deliveries increased  including a increase in residential deliveries and a nearly increase in commercial deliveries 
weather increased earnings from electric delivery billed sales by per share  after accounting for the effect of weather hedging contracts 
electric residential cooling degree days were higher than in and higher than normal 
o an increase of per share due to an increase in natural gas net operating revenues 
deliveries to firm natural gas customers increased overall as compared to an increase in weather normalized sales of 
deliveries to residential and commercial customers  largely space heating sales  increased and  respectively  due to customer growth 
overall  natural gas residential heating degree days were higher than in but were lower during the heating season months of january through march  and november and december 
the decrease in degree days during these months resulted in an earnings impact of weather on natural gas net revenues of per share 
o an increase of per share due to the net effect of various other items including a reduction in regulatory carrying charges due to customers  which was partially offset by an increase in interest charges resulting from the issuance of long term debt in november and december and an increase in the issuance of short term debt 
the reduction in carrying charges reflects the substantial use of the principal balance of the customer benefit fund by december   for customer refunds and other authorized programs 
see note regulatory matters under the subcaption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for discussion of the customer benefit fund 
fuel distribution businesses earnings from chec s fuel distribution businesses increased per share in as compared to  due to the following o an increase of per share due to an increase in gross margins primarily due to an increase in service profitability  earnings from acquisitions made in  and an increase in average gross margin per gallon in all product categories 
the increase in service profitability contributed approximately per share  earnings from acquisitions contributed approximately per share  and increased average gross margins contributed an additional per share 
o a decrease of per share due to an increase in operating expenses and interest expense 
the increase in operating expenses is due to an increase in general and administrative expenses and additional expenses associated with the acquisitions made in interest expense on the intercompany debt increased by per share 
other businesses earnings from energy group the holding company and chec s partnerships and other investment interests increased per share in as compared to  due to the following o an increase of per share due to lower income taxes for energy group  including a per share adjustment relating to the completion of a tax audit for and adjustments of and per share  respectively  relating to and income tax provisions 
o an increase of per share due to an increase in interest income largely from short term investments held by energy group 
the increase results from higher returns due to higher interest rates 
o an increase of per share due to an increase in income from chec s other investment interests 
as compared to energy group s consolidated earnings per share basic for were per share  a decrease of per share basic from earnings of 
details of the change in earnings are as follows regulated electric and natural gas businesses earnings from central hudson s electric and natural gas operations increased per share due to the following o an increase of per share due to a reduction in regulatory carrying charges due to customers resulting primarily from a declining customer benefit fund balance 
in addition to the continuation of customer refunds in and the funding of economic development initiatives and other programs  the customer benefit fund was also used to offset deferred pension and other post employment benefit costs  as authorized in central hudson s joint proposal approved by the psc effective july  see note regulatory matters under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for more details 
o an increase of per share from electric net operating revenues due to an increase in deliveries 
despite milder winter weather in  electric deliveries increased in due to an increase in usage by existing industrial customers and an increase in residential and commercial delivery sales from customer growth 
the milder weather experienced during the first half of as compared to impacted net electric operating revenues by per share  net of the effect of weather hedging contracts 
o an increase of per share from natural gas net operating revenues 
the increase resulted from an increase in large industrial delivery revenues  growth in firm natural gas delivery sales  and the recovery of increased working capital and bad debt costs 
the milder weather experienced during the first half of as compared to decreased net revenues from natural gas deliveries by approximately per share  net of the effect of weather hedging contracts 
o an increase of per share due to the net effect of various other items including a reduction in income taxes and the favorable impact of a lower number of shares of energy group common stock outstanding 
o a decrease of per share from electric regulatory mechanisms  including an increase in electric shared earnings and potential psc assessments for service interruptions 
the increase in shared earnings resulted from an increase in ratemaking operating income in as compared to and a change in the sharing threshold pursuant to the provisions of the joint proposal effective july  o a decrease of per share due to an increase in depreciation and amortization on utility plant assets as a result of an increased balance of utility plants assets 
o a decrease of per share from an increase in taxes other than income taxes  largely property and payroll taxes 
fuel distribution businesses earnings from chec s fuel distribution businesses were unchanged in as compared to  due to the following o an increase of per share due to a reduction in operating expenses excluding the cost of petroleum  natural gas  and related expenses due to improved operating efficiencies and lower sales due to milder weather experienced in the first half of the year 
o a decrease of per share due to a decrease in gross margins 
net revenues were reduced by a reduction in gross profit from sales of petroleum products resulting from customer conservation due to the increased cost of heating oil 
the reduction in net revenues was partially offset by an increase in service department gross profit 
heating degree days were lower in than  affecting earnings by approximately per share  however this was offset by the effect of weather hedging contracts 
o a decrease of per share due to income derived from scasco s natural gas business unit in and the gain on the disposal of the natural gas business unit in other businesses earnings from energy group the holding company and chec s interests in partnerships and other investments fell by per share due to the following o a decrease of per share from investment income due primarily to the liquidation  by july  of energy group s alternate investment program and reinvestment of the proceeds in low risk and lower yield money market instruments 
o a decrease of per share due to an increase in business development costs 
this increase reflects energy group s intensified efforts to redeploy its available capital in suitable investment opportunities 
o a decrease of per share due to the net effect of various other items  including an increase in other expenses and income taxes  which was partially offset by an increase in net income from chec s partnership and other investment interests 
operating revenues energy group s consolidated operating revenues increased million  or  in as compared to  and decreased million  or  in as compared to details of these revenue changes are presented in the following charts and related discussions concerning the variances increase or decrease from prior year in thousands regulated unregulated fuel electric natural gas distribution other total customer sales  a  b  c  sales to other utilities    energy cost adjustment d    deferred revenues e    miscellaneous   total     increase or decrease from prior year in thousands regulated unregulated fuel electric natural gas distribution other total customer sales  a b  c  sales to other utilities energy cost adjustment d    deferred revenues e   miscellaneous   total     a includes an offsetting restoration of amounts from central hudson s customer benefit fund described under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements of this k annual report for customer refunds to all customers and back out credits for retail access customers 
b includes both firm and interruptible revenues 
c due to increase in average selling price of all petroleum products due to higher wholesale purchase prices 
d changes in energy cost adjustment revenues do not affect earnings since they offset related costs 
e includes the restoration of other revenues from central hudson s customer benefit fund for other authorized programs  the restoration of previously deferred delivery revenues  and the deferral of electric and natural gas shared earnings in accordance with the provisions of central hudson s current rate agreement with the psc described in note regulatory matters to the consolidated financial statements of this k annual report 
regulated electric and natural gas businesses utility electric and natural gas operating revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the higher cost of purchased electricity and increased usage due to hotter than normal weather  and higher cost of purchased natural gas 
electric revenues increased million  or  and natural gas revenues increased million  or  both due largely to an increase in the amounts collected through central hudson s energy cost adjustment mechanisms for the recovery of its cost of purchased electricity and natural gas 
the revenue increase also reflects an increase in deliveries and an increase in sales for resale revenues 
the increase in electric revenues was partially offset by a reduction in revenues from weather hedging contracts  the absence in of the amortization of previously deferred electric delivery revenues  and psc assessments related to service interruptions 
utility electric and natural gas operating revenues decreased million  or  from million in to million in electric revenues decreased million  or  and natural gas revenues increased million  or 
the decrease in electric revenues is due primarily to a decrease in revenues collected through central hudson s energy cost adjustment mechanisms to recover its cost of purchased electricity  a reduction in customer benefit fund revenues offsetting electric reliability program costs which was substantially completed by the end of  and an increase in shared earnings 
changes in revenues related to the recovery of purchased electricity and natural gas costs and the customer benefit fund do not affect earnings since they offset related costs 
the reduction in electric revenues was partially offset by an increase in revenues from the delivery of electricity  including the favorable effect of weather hedging contracts 
natural gas revenues increased due largely to an increase in revenues collected for the recovery of natural gas supply costs  an increase in natural gas sold for resale  and an increase in revenues from sales of natural gas  net of weather hedging contracts 
an increase in shared earnings partially offset the increase in natural gas revenues 
fuel distribution businesses revenues for chec s fuel distribution businesses  net of the effect of weather hedging contracts  increased million  or  from million in to million in due to the significant increase in the price of petroleum products 
revenues from petroleum products increased million  or  from million in to million in due to an increase in the average selling price to cover the increased cost of petroleum products 
motor fuel revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in heating oil revenues also increased million  or  from million in to million in partially offsetting the overall increases in selling price was a reduction in sales volumes 
other revenues related to service and installations  energy services  and propane sales increased million 
revenues for chec s fuel distribution businesses  net of the effect of weather hedging contracts  increased million  or  from million in to million in revenues from petroleum products increased million  or  from million in to million in largely due to an increase in motor fuel revenues 
these revenues increased million  or  from million in to million in due primarily to a rise in the average selling price of motor fuels and an increase in sales volumes 
heating oil revenues also increased million to million largely due to the effect of weather hedging contracts with more favorable terms for than partially offsetting the overall increase in revenues was a reduction of million in natural gas revenues due to the sale of scasco s natural gas business unit 
other revenues related to service and installations  energy services  and propane sales decreased million 
delivery volumes delivery volumes for both central hudson and chec s fuel distribution businesses vary in response to weather conditions 
electric deliveries peak in the summer  and deliveries of natural gas and petroleum products consumed for heating purposes peak in the winter 
regulated electric and natural gas businesses utility deliveries of electricity within central hudson s service territory increased in as compared to deliveries to residential and commercial customers increased and  respectively  resulting from increased usage due to a hotter summer and modest customer growth 
deliveries to industrial customers were flat 
cooling degree days increased over the prior year and were higher than normal 
utility deliveries of natural gas to firm central hudson customers increased in as compared to deliveries to residential and commercial customers increased and  respectively  due to customer growth 
industrial deliveries  which represent less than of total firm deliveries in and  decreased  while deliveries to interruptible customers decreased 
utility deliveries of electricity within central hudson s service territory increased in as compared to deliveries to residential customers increased  deliveries to commercial customers increased  and deliveries to industrial customers increased 
deliveries to residential and commercial customers increased due primarily to customer growth  increased usage despite milder weather in the first half of  and a cooler summer  in each case as compared to industrial deliveries increased due to additional usage by existing customers 
natural gas residential heating degree days in were lower than in and lower than normal 
electric residential cooling degree days for july through september were lower than in and lower than normal 
utility deliveries of natural gas to firm central hudson customers decreased in as compared to residential and commercial deliveries  primarily for space heating  decreased and  respectively  due largely to a decrease in usage resulting from the milder weather experienced in the first half of the decrease in deliveries was partially offset by customer growth 
industrial deliveries  representing approximately of total firm deliveries in and  decreased 
interruptible deliveries increased due largely to an increase in sales to large industrial natural gas transportation customers 
changes in deliveries by major customer classification  including interruptible natural gas deliveries  are set forth below 
increase decrease from prior year electric mwh natural gas mcf residential commercial industrial interruptible n a n a as a result of sharing arrangements established for interruptible natural gas deliveries and interruptible transportation of customer owned natural gas  as described under the caption incentive arrangements below  variations in these deliveries from year to year typically have a minimal impact on earnings 
incentive arrangements under certain earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc  central hudson either shares with its customers certain revenues and or cost savings exceeding predetermined levels or is penalized in some cases for shortfalls from certain performance standards 
earnings sharing formulas are currently effective for interruptible natural gas deliveries  natural gas capacity release transactions  electric service reliability  certain aspects of customer service and customer satisfaction  and certain aspects of market participant satisfaction 
the net results of these and previous earnings sharing formulas also had the effect of decreasing pre tax earnings by million in and increasing pre tax earnings by million and million above the applicable sharing thresholds during and  respectively 
in addition to the above noted items  central hudson shares with customers earnings above the base return on equity roe of on the equity portion of central hudson s rate base 
earnings above roe and up to roe are shared between central hudson and ratepayers  earnings above roe and up to are shared between central hudson and ratepayers  and earnings above roe are added to the customer benefit fund 
during   and central hudson recorded million  million  and million as a regulatory liability for the customer portion of these pre tax shared earnings 
see note regulatory matters of this k annual report under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for a description of earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc for central hudson 
fuel distribution businesses sales of petroleum products decreased million gallons  or  to gallons in from million gallons in this was primarily as a result of a decrease of million gallons  or  in sales of heating oil from million gallons in to million gallons in the decrease in sales was primarily due to a reduction in commercial sales resulting from higher relative prices for heating oil as compared to those for natural gas and a decrease in residential sales due to customer attrition and conservation because of the increased cost of heating oil 
motor fuel sales decreased million gallons  or  from million gallons in to million gallons in while sales of propane decreased slightly from million gallons in to million gallons in motor fuel sales decreased primarily from customer attrition resulting principally from the loss of one large volume  low margin customer 
the decrease in propane sales is largely attributable to customer conservation 
the weather was colder in than in as evidenced by a increase in heating degree days as compared to sales of petroleum products decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons in from million gallons in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in heating oil of million gallons  or  to million gallons in from million gallons in residential sales decreased approximately million gallons  primarily due to warmer weather as evidenced by a average decrease in heating degree days for as compared to and customer conservation due to the increased cost of heating oil 
additionally  the sales of propane decreased million gallons  or  from million gallons in to million gallons in this decrease was also primarily due to the warmer weather in in comparison to partially offsetting these decreases  motor fuel sales increased million gallons  or  from million gallons in to million gallons in due to the sale of scasco s natural gas business unit on october   there were no sales of natural gas in as compared to sales of  mcf in operating expenses regulated electric and natural gas businesses the most significant elements of central hudson s operating expenses are purchased electricity and purchased natural gas 
the following reflects  as a percentage of every revenue dollar related to electric or natural gas deliveries  the amount expended for purchased electricity including nominal amounts spent for fuel used in electric generation and purchased natural gas for   and purchased electricity purchased natural gas central hudson negotiated multi year electricity purchase contracts with the new owners of the major generating assets it divested 
purchases under these contracts are supplemented by purchases from the nyiso and other parties 
for information regarding these electricity purchase contracts  see item properties under the subcaption load and capacity and note regulatory matters under the caption sales of major generating assets 
total utility operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity costs increased million due to an increase in wholesale prices for volumes purchased for full service customers  while natural gas costs increased million due to an increase in wholesale prices and volumes purchased 
other expenses of operation increased million due primarily to an increase in depreciation and amortization of utility plant assets and taxes other than income taxes 
the latter reflects an increase in property taxes and regulatory adjustments related to the new york state income tax 
total utility operating expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity and fuel used in electric generation decreased million due largely to the recording of amounts related to the recovery of electric supply costs via central hudson s energy cost recovery mechanism and an increase in volumes supplied directly by marketers to customers opting for retail access service 
other expenses of operation decreased million  due primarily to a reduction in expenses for central hudson s electric reliability program and a decrease in storm restoration costs 
the electric reliability program was substantially completed in and was funded by the customer benefit fund 
partially offsetting the decrease in utility operating expenses was an increase of million in the cost of purchased natural gas 
this increase was largely driven by an increase in wholesale costs partially offset by a decrease in costs relative to volume and the recording of amounts related to the full recovery of natural gas supply costs 
as discussed under the caption operating revenues for the regulated electric and natural gas business  changes in the cost of purchased electricity and natural gas do not affect earnings since they are offset by changes in related revenues 
fuel distribution businesses operating expenses for the fuel distribution businesses for increased million  or  from million in to million in the cost of petroleum increased million  or  due to higher wholesale market prices 
other operating expenses increased million in due to an increase in general and administrative expenses 
as compared to  operating expenses for increased million  or  from million to million 
the most significant operating expense for the fuel distribution businesses is the cost of petroleum  which increased million due primarily to higher wholesale market prices of petroleum 
this was partially offset by a decrease of million in natural gas costs due to the sale of scasco s natural gas business unit in other operating expenses decreased million largely due to improved operating efficiencies by the fuel distribution businesses and lower sales due to milder weather experienced in the first half of the year 
other income and deductions regulated electric and natural gas businesses other income and deductions for central hudson decreased million  or  in as compared to  due to the completion of the amortization in december of central hudson s share of the gain from the sales of its interests in its major generating assets see subcaption expired amortization below and a reduction in carrying charges due from customers related to pension costs 
in its june rate order adopting the terms of central hudson s joint proposal for rate plan modification  the psc authorized the use of the customer benefit fund to offset pension under collection balances  which reduced the balance upon which regulatory carrying charges for pension costs are determined 
this reduction was partially offset by favorable regulatory adjustments for the change in interest rates on central hudson s variable rate long term debt 
the variations related to central hudson s variable rate long term debt and pension related carrying charges are offset by changes in interest charges relating to these items 
other income and deductions decreased million in as compared to due to lower interest income from temporary cash investments and the early settlement of a balance due to central hudson from the purchaser of its ownership interest in the nine mile plant 
the reduction also reflects a reduction in regulatory carrying charges due from customers related to pension costs  as noted above in the discussion for expired amortization under a prior psc regulatory settlement related to the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets  a portion of the gain recognized on those sales was recorded as other income over a four year period which commenced in and ended in amounts recorded by year  net of tax  were as follows million  million  million  and million 
other businesses other income and deductions for energy group the holding company and chec s investments in partnerships and other investments other than fuel distribution operations increased million in as compared to the increase primarily reflects an increase in interest income from short term investments held by energy group due to higher interest rates  an increase in income from chec s partnership and other investments  and a decrease in business development costs 
other income and deductions decreased million in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in investment income from the liquidation of energy group s alternate investment program and an increase in business development costs 
the alternate investment program was fully liquidated by july and the proceeds were reinvested in low risk and lower yield money market instruments 
the increase in business development costs reflects efforts to redeploy this available capital in suitable investment opportunities 
interest charges regulated electric and natural gas businesses interest charges decreased million in as compared to due to a reduction of regulatory carrying charges due to customers resulting from the substantial use  by december   of the principal balance of the customer benefit fund for customer refunds and other authorized programs 
in accordance with the settlement agreement  carrying charges were accrued on the unused balance deferred for the future benefit of customers 
this reduction in carrying charges was partially offset by an increase in interest charges on long and short term debt 
interest on long term debt increased due to the issuance of medium term notes in november and december and higher interest rates on central hudson s variable rate debt 
additional short term debt was required throughout for working capital needs due to the escalation of fuel prices 
interest charges for central hudson decreased million in as compared to the reduction in interest charges was due largely to a decrease in regulatory carrying charges accrued on central hudson s declining customer benefit fund balance 
in addition to providing additional customer refunds in and continuing to fund economic development initiatives and other programs  the customer benefit fund was also used to offset deferred pension and other post retirement benefit costs

other matters nyiso re pricing adjustment on july   central hudson received a payment from the nyiso for adjustments to energy sales transactions that had occurred in may  when central hudson owned the danskammer plant and a share of the roseton plant 
the adjustments resulted from a decision of the united state court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit court and a subsequent order of the ferc that directed the nyiso to increase the real time pricing on those transactions 
since the payment related to unresolved billing issues existing at june   its impact was recorded in the financial results for that quarter 
the payment resulted in an increase to net income of  or per share 
additionally  as a result of psc regulatory mechanisms in place in  customers received million of the nyiso payments which were returned to them through central hudson s energy cost adjustment mechanism 
the energy policy act of on august   the energy act became law 
the energy act is designed as a comprehensive platform for the modernization  reform  and development of the electric industry  to facilitate the development of cleaner  more environmentally acceptable fuels and greater energy efficiency  and to streamline the related approval processes and consolidate the ferc s regulatory authority over the energy market 
in addition  the energy act repeals puhca  effective february  energy group and central hudson expect that the repeal of puhca will eliminate significant federal restrictions on the scope  structure  and ownership of companies in the electric industry 
energy group and central hudson have reviewed the components of the energy act to assess the impact on its businesses and to ensure compliance with all applicable provisions 
provisions that may affect energy group and central hudson are in the areas of electricity and energy policy  tax incentives  energy efficiency  climate change  oil and natural gas  and incentives for innovative technologies 
energy group and central hudson anticipate that regulations implementing the energy act will be forthcoming 
at the present time  neither energy group nor central hudson can predict the effect that the energy act or these implementing regulations may have on its financial condition or operations 
higher energy prices for most of  central hudson s regulated electric and natural gas delivery customers received higher bills than those they received during  reflecting higher consumption in response to hotter summer weather and higher market prices for electricity and natural gas 
while higher energy prices themselves have little or no impact on earnings due to adjustment mechanisms that recover energy costs from customers  efforts by customers to reduce energy consumption could affect earnings by reducing delivery volumes 
to help manage the impact of higher energy prices on customers  central hudson has implemented an outreach program to assist customers with efforts to manage their energy bills 
coupled with consumer awareness that higher energy prices are expected to continue throughout the heating season  management believes that a change in customer behavior toward increased energy efficiency could occur and could have a negative impact on earnings 
additionally  persistently higher prices or further price increases could lead to an economic slowdown and dampen economic growth in central hudson s service territory 
slower growth could adversely affect the overall volume of electricity and natural gas deliveries  reducing earnings from utility operations 
customers of chec s fuel distribution businesses are also experiencing higher prices and may further alter their behavior as a result of higher prices 
in the portion of the heating season ended december   chec s fuel distribution businesses experienced year over year volume decreases driven by price sensitive customer attrition  conservation and energy efficiency efforts  and fuel switching 
fuel oil prices are currently projected to be higher on average in the heating season than they were in the heating season and continued customer attrition and energy efficiency efforts could further reduce residential fuel delivery volumes 
both central hudson s electricity and natural gas businesses and chec s fuel distribution businesses may also face several other challenges that could result from continued higher prices higher working capital needs driven by lags between disbursements to energy suppliers and receipts from customers  higher bad debt expenses resulting from customers who are unable to pay higher energy bills  and political and regulatory responses to higher energy prices 
management believes that energy group has adequate liquidity to meet the working capital demands of the current and near term energy price environment and is actively monitoring bad debt expense and the political regulatory environment 
chec s investment in ethanol production may realize benefits from higher energy prices in the future through higher prices for the ethanol produced 
these benefits  however  may be partially offset by higher prices for the fuel used in the ethanol production process 
in aggregate  energy group does not expect higher energy prices to have a material effect on its financial results in  but is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate level of energy prices  potential customer response to those prices  and the corresponding financial impact on its operating companies and investments 
natural gas during the third quarter of  two hurricanes in the gulf of mexico caused significant damage to that region s energy infrastructure 
while central hudson s facilities were not affected by the hurricanes  the resulting disruptions in the nation s energy markets may continue in the near term and could have an indirect effect on its business 
as a result of the hurricanes  a significant amount of gulf coast natural gas production feeding into interstate pipelines serving the atlantic seaboard and the northeastern united states became unavailable 
during the heating season  it is possible that a significant amount of this supply source could remain unavailable  causing natural gas supplies in the northeastern united states to tighten 
to mitigate potential impacts  central hudson intends to rely on a diversity of supply sources  including connections to pipelines not affected by the hurricanes  natural gas stored north of any hurricane disruptions  and its own propane air peaking facilities within its service territory 
central hudson made contingency liquified natural gas and canadian natural gas purchases to help ensure that adequate supply is available for central hudson s customers

retirement plan as described more fully in note post employment benefits  central hudson has a non contributory retirement income plan retirement plan covering substantially all of its employees 
the retirement plan is a defined benefit plan which provides pension benefits that are based on an employee s compensation and years of service 
the significant assumptions and estimates used to account for the retirement plan are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on retirement plan assets  the rate of compensation increase  and the method of amortizing gains and losses 
the discount rate is determined each year as of september based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled 
the rate is based on high quality bond yields  after allowing for call and default risk 
central hudson considers high quality corporate bond indices  such as moody s aa  when selecting the discount rate 
central hudson selects the rate after consultation with its actuarial consultant 
central hudson s discount rate was as of the most recent valuation date  september  in determining the expected long term rate of return on retirement plan assets  central hudson considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily united states government bonds  the historical level of risk premiums associated with other asset classes  and the expectations of future returns over a year time horizon on each asset class  based on the views of leading financial advisors and economists 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the retirement plan s target asset allocation 
central hudson also considered expectations of value added by active management  net of investment expenses 
the rate of compensation increase was based on historical and current compensation practices of central hudson giving consideration to any anticipated changes in this practice 
actuarial gains and losses  which include investment returns and demographic experience which are different than anticipated based on the actuarial assumptions  are amortized in accordance with procedures set forth by the psc which require the full gain or loss arising each year to be amortized uniformly over ten years 
the unrecognized net losses are currently million  including losses for the years through therefore  the future annual amortization of these losses will increase pension expense  determined under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 entitled employers accounting for pensions  from its current level unless there are offsetting future gains or other offsetting components of pension expense 
since september   the latest measurement date  there have been no material changes in the level of retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the retirement plan liabilities  or the assumptions regarding expected returns on retirement plan assets 
based on current levels of retirement plan assets and obligations  a change of one quarter percent in the long term rate of return assumption would change pension expense by approximately million and a change of one quarter percent in the discount rate would change pension expense by approximately million 
under the policy of the psc regarding pension costs  central hudson recovers its net periodic pension costs through customer rates with differences from rate allowances deferred for future recovery from or return to customers 
as a result  central hudson expects to fully recover its net periodic pension costs over time 
the retirement plan s liquidity is primarily affected by the cash contributions made by central hudson to the retirement plan 
central hudson contributed million to the retirement plan in central hudson did not make a contribution to the retirement plan in or based on current practice  central hudson s actuarial consultant has estimated that total contributions to the retirement plan for the four year period from to could range from million to million 
the actual contributions could vary significantly based upon economic growth  inflation  and interest rate assumptions

energy group s net cash flows provided by operating activities during were million lower as compared to cash flow decreased primarily because of a substantial increase in customer accounts receivable for central hudson and chec  the absence of proceeds from central hudson s sale of emission allowances in  and an increase in the price paid in by central hudson for natural gas purchased for inventory 
the substantial increase in customer accounts receivable is related to the pass through to customers of the increased costs for purchased electricity  natural gas  and petroleum products  due largely to an increase in the wholesale price of each as compared to the same period in increased sales for central hudson also contributed to this increase in accounts receivable  reflecting customer growth for residential and commercial customer classes and increased usage 
cash flow from operations was also lower in due to the absence of the amended utility service tax refund that central hudson received in slightly offsetting these decreases in cash flow was a reduction in costs related to various programs funded by central hudson s customer benefit fund  including refunds to electric customers 
as authorized in the joint proposal approved by the psc  deferred electric pension and opeb costs  including carrying charges  were offset against the customer benefit fund with no impact to cash flow for the total amount offset in was million as compared to million in central hudson will continue to use the customer benefit fund to offset the cost of various programs

net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change for the period balance at beginning of period balance at end of period net cash provided by operating activities central hudson s net cash flows provided by operating activities reflect principally its energy deliveries and costs of operations 
variations in the volume of energy deliveries are primarily driven by factors external to central hudson  such as weather and economic conditions  including the price of energy 
prices at which central hudson delivers energy to its customers are determined in accordance with rate plans approved by the psc 
in general  changes in the costs of purchased electricity and purchased natural gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not overall net income  as these costs are fully recoverable through central hudson s electric and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms

net cash used in investing activities central hudson s cash flows from investing activities of million in  an increase of million over  were comprised entirely of construction and  to a lesser extent  removal expenditures 
central hudson continues to make significant investments in its electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems 
in addition to upgrades for system reliability  those investments are driven by growth in the number of electric and natural gas customers  the volume of energy delivered to customers  and system peak demand trends 
growth related investments are the primary driver for the year over year increases in net property  plant  and equipment recently experienced by central hudson 
net cash used in financing activities to finance its operations  which reflect variations related to weather and other timing issues from year to year  its capital expenditures  as well as manage its capital structure  central hudson uses a combination of short term and long term borrowing and retains a portion of its earnings 
generally  the growth in its net utility plant is financed by long term debt and retained earnings  while variations related to working capital are financed using short term borrowings 
net cash flows related to financing activities were million higher during as compared to the resulting increase in cash flows was primarily driven by higher net borrowing of short term debt  the absence of any long term debt retirement  and lower dividends paid to energy group in as compared to additionally  central hudson issued million in medium term notes in as compared to million issued in capital structure energy group s consolidated capital structure reflects the external debt and preferred stock of central hudson

the estimated present value of central hudson s total contractual obligations is million  assuming a discount rate of 
central hudson may also have an obligation to fund its retirement plan and other post retirement benefit obligations 
decisions to fund the retirement plan are made annually and are primarily affected by the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations and the projection of retirement plan assets 
based on current practice  central hudson s actuarial consultant has estimated that total contributions to the retirement plan for the four year period from to could range from million to million 
this range depends upon economic growth  inflation  and interest rate assumptions  and actual contributions could be higher 
it is anticipated that any contributions made would be sufficient to eliminate any pension benefit guaranty corporation variable rate premiums or would maintain a gateway current liability funded level 
the federal government is working on pension reform which could have a significant impact on future funding requirements 
contributions to fund other post retirement benefits opeb were million for obligations for future funding depend on a number of factors  including the discount rate  expected return  and medical claims assumptions used 
if these factors remain stable  annual funding for the next few years is expected to approximate the amount 
under the policy of the psc regarding pension and opeb costs  central hudson recovers these costs through customer rates with differences from rate allowances deferred for future recovery from or return to customers 
based on the current policy  central hudson expects to fully recover its net periodic pension and opeb costs over time 
anticipated sources and uses of cash energy group s cash flow is primarily generated by the operations of its subsidiaries  central hudson and chec 
generally  the subsidiaries do not accumulate cash but rather provide cash to energy group in the form of dividends and  in the case of chec  repayments on its intercompany loan 
energy group had million of cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet on december   which included million held by energy group the holding company and designated primarily for investments and acquisitions 
of that amount  approximately million is committed to existing investments and approximately to million is expected to be invested in central hudson by retaining earnings within central hudson that would otherwise be paid as dividends to energy group 
energy group continues to seek new investment and acquisition opportunities through its business development activities 
central hudson s planned capital expenditures for construction and removal during are expected to total approximately million 
for  planned capital expenditures are expected to range from million to million 
capital expenditures are expected to be funded with cash from operations and a combination of short term and long term borrowings 
central hudson may alter its plan for capital expenditures as needed to mitigate the need for future borrowings or as its business needs require 
central hudson is expected to pay a dividend to energy group that will be less than its level of net income in central hudson is expected to retain earnings to fund a portion of its growth in long lived assets  while using long term debt to fund the remainder and to manage its capital structure 
central hudson anticipates issuing the remaining million of its series e medium term notes to meet its long term debt needs in there are no scheduled maturities of long term debt in short term debt is expected to be used to fund seasonal and temporary variations in working capital requirements 
in a stable price environment  central hudson does not expect significant changes in its current level of working capital 
chec s capital expenditures are driven by its fuel distribution businesses and are expected to be approximately million during  excluding any possible acquisitions 
for  capital expenditures  excluding any possible acquisitions  are expected to range from million to million 
chec s fuel distribution businesses continue to explore opportunities to expand through both internal growth and acquisitions  depending on financial performance and opportunities available 
chec may alter its plan for capital expenditures and acquisitions as its business needs require 
assuming normal weather and a stable wholesale fuel price environment  chec s fuel distribution businesses are expected to generate sufficient cash flow to fund normal annual capital expenditures for facilities  equipment  and vehicles as well as partially fund acquisitions or return capital to energy group 
in  the fuel distribution businesses experienced a rising wholesale fuel price environment that caused an increase in working capital requirements 
generally  there is a lag between payments to wholesale fuel suppliers and collection of receipts from retail fuel customers 
increases in funding requirements in were financed by energy group through intercompany loans 
it is difficult to project wholesale fuel oil prices with any certainty in if the wholesale fuel price environment were one in which prices were to remain stable at the levels experienced in the latter months of  management expects the fuel distribution businesses to generate cash flow that would be returned to energy group or used to fund acquisitions 
if the wholesale fuel price environment were one of falling prices  management expects an additional return of working capital to improve free cash flow 
in an environment of rising prices  increased working capital requirements would reduce cash flow and  depending on the magnitude of price increases  could require additional financing from energy group 
financing program in april  energy group amended its million unsecured credit facility with several commercial banks  extending the term of that facility through april the credit facility  along with available cash  is currently earmarked for acquisitions and investments and is described further in note short term borrowing arrangements 
as of december   chec had an unsecured line of credit totaling million 
as more fully discussed in note short term borrowing arrangements  central hudson  pursuant to authority from the psc  entered into a million unsecured credit agreement effective july   through june  in addition  central hudson maintains a committed line of credit of million and certain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks 
these arrangements give central hudson competitive options to minimize the cost of its short term borrowing 
authorization from the psc limits the amount central hudson may have outstanding at any time under all of its short term borrowing arrangements to million in the aggregate

the settlement agreement contains certain dividend payment restrictions on central hudson  including limitations on the amount of dividends payable if central hudson s senior debt ratings are downgraded by more than one major rating agency due to performance or concerns about the financial condition of energy group or any energy group subsidiary other than central hudson 
these limitations would result in the average annual income available for dividends on a two year rolling average basis being reduced to i  if the downgrade were to a rating below bbb  ii if the senior debt were placed on credit watch or the equivalent because of a rating below bbb  or iii no dividends payable if the downgrade were to a rating below bbb 
these restrictions survived the june   expiration of the settlement agreement

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risks for energy group and its subsidiaries are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk  related primarily to purchases of natural gas  electricity  and petroleum products for resale  is mitigated in several different ways 
central hudson  under the settlement agreement  collects its actual purchased electricity and purchased natural gas costs through cost adjustment clauses in its rates 
these adjustment clauses provide for the collection of costs  including risk management and working capital costs  from customers to reflect the actual costs incurred in obtaining supply 
risk management costs are defined by the psc as costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers 
these costs include transaction costs  and gains and losses associated with risk management instruments 
griffith and  prior to december   scasco may increase the prices charged for the commodities it sells in response to changes in costs  however  the ability to raise prices is limited by the competitive market 
depending on market conditions  central hudson and griffith enter into long term fixed supply and long term forward supply contracts for the purchase of these commodities 
central hudson also uses natural gas storage facilities  which enable it to purchase and hold quantities of natural gas at pre heating season prices for use during the heating season 
central hudson and the fuel distribution businesses have in place an energy risk management program to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  various risks associated with their respective operations  namely commodity price risk and sales volatility due to weather 
this risk management program permits the use of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes and does not permit their use for trading or speculative purposes 
central hudson and griffith have entered into either exchange traded futures contracts or over the counter otc contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase of natural gas  electricity  and petroleum products and to hedge the effect on earnings due to significant variances in weather conditions from normal patterns 
the types of derivative instruments used include natural gas futures and basis swaps to hedge natural gas purchases  contracts for differences to hedge electricity purchases  put and call options to hedge oil purchases  and weather derivatives 
otc derivative transactions are entered into only with counter parties that meet certain credit criteria 
the creditworthiness of these counter parties is determined primarily by reference to published credit ratings 
at december   central hudson had open derivative contracts to hedge natural gas prices through march  covering approximately of central hudson s projected total natural gas supply requirements during this period 
in  derivative transactions were used to hedge of central hudson s total natural gas supply requirements as compared to in in its electric operations  central hudson had open derivatives at december   hedging approximately of its required electricity supply through february in  central hudson hedged approximately of its total electricity supply requirements with otc derivative contracts as compared to in in addition  central hudson has in place agreements to purchase electricity produced by certain of its former major generating assets and other generating facilities at fixed prices 
the notional amounts hedged by the derivatives and the electricity purchase agreements for and represent approximately and  respectively  of its total anticipated electricity supply requirements in each year 
at december   griffith and scasco had open otc put and call option positions covering approximately of their combined anticipated fuel oil supply requirements for the period from january through may the percentage hedged at december   for the period january to june was 
in  derivatives were used to hedge of these requirements as compared to in scasco s positions were transferred to griffith upon the merger of scasco into griffith  effective december  derivative contracts are discussed in more detail in note summary of significant accounting policies under the subcaption accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
interest rate risk affects central hudson but is managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates related to central hudson s bonds issued by the new york state energy research development authority and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual refund to  or recovery from  customers 
the variability in interest rates is also managed with the use of a derivative financial instrument known as an interest rate cap agreement  for which the premium cost and any realized benefits also pass through the aforementioned regulatory recovery mechanism 
the current interest rate cap agreement expires on april  central hudson will evaluate available alternatives to replace the interest rate cap in the first quarter of central hudson also repurchases or redeems existing debt at a lower cost when market conditions permit 
please refer to note capitalization long term debt and note financial instruments for additional disclosure related to long term debt 
interest rate risk affects chec through the intercompany debt provided by energy group  which is generally set annually at then prevailing market interest rates 
a year to year increase in the interest rate for chec s intercompany debt may affect chec s earnings if it is unable to offset increased interest expense with a corresponding increase in its operating margin 
energy group is affected by interest rate risk through the interest income on the intercompany loan to chec and the interest income on cash balances and short term investments 
upon consolidation  changes in the rate of interest on the intercompany borrowing arrangements between chec and energy group have no net earnings impact 
energy group s interest income on cash balances and short term investments  however  is directly affected by changes in the market rates of interest available
