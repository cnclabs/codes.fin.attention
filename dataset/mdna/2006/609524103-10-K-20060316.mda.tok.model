the company is a diversified reit 
currently  the company s primary business is the ownership of eleven industrial properties subject to medium term leases and investing in marketable securities 
these securities include securities of other reits and mortgage backed securities 
the company also has loans receivable and inventory related to the sales of manufactured homes

the company s revenue primarily consists of rental and related income from the ownership of the industrial properties  interest and dividend income  and gains on securities transactions 
sales of manufactured homes relates to the sale of inventory which had been repossessed and resold 
although the company currently owns eleven industrial properties  management would consider other types of real estate acquisitions 
management anticipates that the company will acquire approximately  in properties during the current acquisitions environment is competitive and management may not be able to locate suitable properties for acquisition 
rental income and reimbursements increased  or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due mainly to the rent and reimbursements related to the new property acquisitions in and net income decreased  or for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease in net income is mainly due to a decrease in gain on securities transactions  net  a decrease in interest and dividend incom e and increases in real estate taxes  interest expense and depreciation 
the decrease in net income was partially offset by increases in rental income and reimbursements 
the company has financed acquisitions through capital raised through the company s dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  by obtaining mortgages  and from private placement offerings  including the convertible subordinated debentures 
if suitable acquisitions cannot be found during  the company may invest additional capital raised in reit securities or pay down outstanding debt

significant accounting policies estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
for a detailed description of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the company s financial statements included in this form k 
management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
real estate investments the company applies financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to measure impairment in real estate investments 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis without interest from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
securities available for sale investments in liquid real estate assets consist primarily of marketable equity reit securities 
management reviews our marketable securities for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or circumstances occur 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized in earnings and the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as the new cost basis 
management s evaluation includes consideration of events that may be attributable to the unrealized loss  including among other things  the credit worthiness of the issuer  length of time that a security had a continuous unrealized loss  and the financial position of the issuing company 
estimates and revenue recognition estimates are used to establish amounts receivable from tenants for such things as annualized rents  real estate taxes and other cost recoveries 
in addition  an estimate is made with respect to whether a provision for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and loans receivable is necessary 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management s estimate of the amounts of the recorded accounts receivable and loans receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
if cash receipts in subsequent periods vary from our estimates  or if the company s tenants financial condition deteriorates as a result of operating difficulties  additional changes to the allowance may be required
