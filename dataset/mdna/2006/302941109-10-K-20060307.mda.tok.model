as of december   we had revenue generating consultants in our economic consulting practice 
industry overview we compete in the global consulting services industry  focusing on providing forensic litigation technology  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting services 
we believe that the business environment for our industry has become increasingly complex due to heightened public scrutiny  greater regulation  increased competition and globalization as well as the prevalence of high stakes litigation 
there are a number of factors that drive demand for our services increasing need for independent expertise 
we believe that as a result of increased public scrutiny  regulatory complexity and litigation  businesses  their creditors and other institutional stakeholders increasingly engage consulting firms to provide objective and independent expertise 
this is particularly true in highly complex and sophisticated areas such as restructurings  bankruptcies  economic consulting  forensic accounting and high stakes regulatory and legal proceedings 
the emerging trend toward hiring consulting firms unaffiliated with company auditors represents a fundamental shift in the demand for our services and has increased the size of our overall practices 
trends in corporate debt and debt default rates 
we believe that corporate debt levels and related default rates are important indicators of the potential need for restructuring  turnaround  bankruptcy and related consulting services 
according to thomson financial  both us and international companies have continued to rely on debt to finance acquisitions  growth initiatives and working capital requirements  as evidenced by the fact that there were more issuances of us and global long term debt in than  although us and global high yield corporate debt offerings decreased from the prior year 
demand for our services is particularly strong in sectors such as automotive  airline and retail  all of which rely on corporate debt and continue to exhibit sector weakness 
regulatory complexity  public scrutiny and increased litigation 
we believe that heightened focus on corporate mismanagement  fraud related investigations  ongoing regulatory activity  such as sec rulemaking  corporate governance scrutiny and increasing complexity in financial reporting requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  drive demand for our services 
we believe that increasing litigation costs require businesses to focus on better managing risks and the litigation process  particularly in large  complex  multi jurisdiction cases and mass tort claims 
strong economy and growing merger and acquisition activity 
we believe that the overall strength of the economy and the growth in merger and acquisition activity are important drivers for our economic consulting services 
the united states has seen improving economic conditions  as evidenced by growth of the us gross domestic product  or gdp 
during measured from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  real gdp increased percent 
real gdp increased percent during the price index for gross domestic purchases increased percent during  the same increase as during additionally  according to thomson financial  completed us merger and acquisition volume increased from to we believe there are more complex  high stakes litigation and regulatory activity during strong economic conditions

we believe that we are one of the most recognized brand names in the corporate finance restructuring services industry 
in addition  we believe we have leading market positions in both our forensic litigation technology and economic consulting practices based on revenues for those segments 
the strength of our brand name and market positions are enhanced by the reputation of our well recognized consultants  many of whom are leading members of their respective fields 
we have benefited from our strategy of acquiring the leading practitioners in each practice  as well as including in select cases  the continued use of their brand names  either independently or coupled with the fti brand  such as lexecon  ringtail  cambio  and compass 
diversified revenue source

we have begun to focus on renegotiating new long term employment agreements with key senior managing directors 
any new employment agreements entered into with senior managing directors may not have staggered termination dates  so we could face similar retention issues at the end of the terms of those agreements  although this risk could be reduced in light of our intention to include automatic one year renewal options in the new employment agreements beginning at the end of their initial terms unless either party provides to the other prior notice that he or us do not intend to renew

certain recipients of the shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the purchase agreement entered into agreements not to sell  transfer  assign  pledge or otherwise dispose of their shares of our common stock issued in connection with the acquisition for periods ranging from two to five years after the closing 
the restrictions on any such recipient s shares would lapse immediately upon the occurrence of specified change of control events 
in addition  in the case of such a recipient that is employed by us  the restrictions would lapse immediately upon certain employment related events  and  in the event that the recipient is terminated for cause or resigns without good reason  any restrictions on the shares then held by the recipient would be extended for a period ranging from four to eight years from the date of termination or resignation 
we would be required  subject to specified conditions  to register these recipients shares of our common stock for resale on form s or a successor form if  on the nd day after the second anniversary of the closing or on the fifth anniversary of the closing  rule promulgated under the securities act is not available for resales of such shares 
subject to limited exceptions  we granted contractual protection against a decline in the value of our common stock from the closing date value of to recipients of shares of our common stock issued as consideration for the acquisition 
the price protection periods vary from one to four years after the closing date 
the price protection will generally be further extended for any longer period during which the shares are held in escrow 
we are required to make any price protection payments in cash 
ringtail 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the ringtail group 
the total acquisition cost was million  consisting of net cash of million  transaction costs of million and  restricted shares of our common stock valued at million 
the asset purchase agreement that governed the acquisition provides for an earnout over the next three years based on future performance of up to an aggregate of million  or million per year  consisting  in our sole discretion  of all cash  restricted shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and stock 
based on financial results  the first million was earned and accrued at december  the cash portion of the purchase price was financed from cash on hand and our senior secured credit facility 
we have contractually agreed to pay additional consideration if the value of the shares issued as part of the purchase price and earnout is not at least higher than their respective issuance prices on the date such shares or portion thereof first 
table of contents become eligible for resale under rule of the securities act 
if the market value as such value will be determined pursuant to the asset purchase agreement of the stock issued as of february  is less than million  and the earnout stock is up to million  on their respective eligible resale dates  we will be obligated to pay the difference between the actual market value on such date and the protected share value  which will be paid in cash 
on february   we were not obligated to make any price protection payments related to the initial shares of common stock issued in connection with this transaction 
we have substantial experience with the ringtail products and the employees from ringtail who have joined us  as we use ringtail s software in the electronic evidence  repository services and document management services we provide to certain clients 
edward o brien and christopher priestley  ringtail s founders  and other former ringtail employees have joined us 
mr 
o brien has entered into a written three year employment agreement  and mr 
priestley has entered into a written four year employment agreement 
the employment arrangements for the other employees range from one year to three years and may be extended 
the agreements also contain non competition and non solicitation provisions  which in most cases have been designed to comply with australian law 
lexecon 
on november   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of lexecon from its parent company  nextera 
the purchase price for lexecon consisted of cash totaling million  which was financed from a combination of cash on hand and million of borrowings under our senior bank term loan 
the acquisition of lexecon has enabled us to expand the type and sophistication of the economic consulting services that we offer our clients 
in connection with the acquisition  daniel fischel and dennis carlton  two leading experts on economic consulting in the united states  joined the company 
mr 
fischel s areas of expertise are securities  corporation law  regulation of financial markets and the application of economics of corporate finance to problems in those areas 
mr 
fischel has published widely and is the professor of law and business at the northwestern university school of law and kellogg school of management and the lee and brena freeman professor of law and business emeritus at the university of chicago 
dr 
carlton  professor of economics at the graduate school of business at the university of chicago  specializes in the economics of industrial organization  which is the study of individual markets and includes the study of antitrust and regulatory issues 
joseph p 
kalt  a senior economist  also joined us as a senior managing director at that time 
messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt have entered into employment agreements with us that expire december  in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a non competition arrangement with nextera 
during the five year non competition period  nextera has agreed not to  directly or indirectly  offer or provide services of the type offered by lexecon in the united states and canada 
dispute advisory business of kpmg 
on october   we acquired specified assets and assumed liabilities associated with the dispute advisory services  or das  business of kpmg 
we acquired the das business for million in cash  which we financed from our cash reserves 
the das business complements and expands our forensic litigation technology practice in the analysis and resolution of all phases of complex claims and disputes 
twenty eight former kpmg partners or managing directors have entered into written five year employment agreements that expire october  in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a non competition arrangement with kpmg llp 
during the four year non competition period  kpmg has agreed not to  directly or indirectly  offer or provide dispute advisory services of the type offered within months prior to october   with specified exceptions  and market services using the terms das or das services in the united states 
for a period of five years following the closing date of the acquisition  kpmg also agreed not to hire as a partner  director  principal or employee or engage as an agent or contractor  certain former employees that joined us in connection with the acquisition 
we agreed not to solicit for hire or hire any employee employed by kpmg in its investigative and integrity advisory services business for a period of five years following the closing date  unless such person is a former employee who has not been employed by kpmg for a period of six consecutive months 
ten eyck 
on october   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with ten eyck 
through that acquisition we expanded our consulting services to include sec and similar regulatory investigations  securities law litigation  sec accounting and enforcement  fraud investigations and sarbanes oxley mandated requirements 
we acquired the ten eyck business for million in cash  which we financed from our cash reserves  and  restricted shares of our common stock that was then 
table of contents valued at approximately million 
ten eyck complements and expands our forensic litigation technology practice 
five former ten eyck officers and stockholders have entered into written long term employment agreements that expire on october  employment terms 
the form of written long term employment agreement that we use in connection with most acquisitions and new hires of senior professionals at the senior managing director level or higher generally provides for fixed salary  incentive payments which in some cases may be based on financial measures such as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of other intangible assets  or ebitda and  in some cases  long term equity incentives and other incentive bonus and incentive payments 
our long term employment agreements also typically provide for some form of equity incentive in the form of stock options or restricted stock 
they also entitle the professional to participate in our benefit plans 
in many cases  we extend forgivable loans to professionals  provided they are not executive officers  in lieu of paying cash signing bonuses 
we believe that the loan arrangements which require repayment in full if the employee s employment terminates on certain events prior to his contract s expiration date enhance our ability to attract and retain senior professionals 
as of december   unforgiven loans to senior managing directors and other key professionals in the principal amount of million were outstanding and classified as assets on our balance sheet 
we have  in one case  also required that a senior managing director use the proceeds of the loan made to him to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market  and pledge the purchased shares as collateral for such loan  which is otherwise non recourse 
long term employment agreements generally provide for salary continuation benefits  accrued bonuses and other benefits beyond the termination date if the professional leaves our employ for certain reasons prior to the agreement s expiration date 
the length and amount of payments to be paid by us  following the termination or resignation of a professional who is a party to a long term employment agreement  varies depending on whether such person resigned or was terminated with cause or good reason  resigned or was terminated without cause or good reason  died or became disabled  or was terminated as a result of a change of control 
such employment agreements contain non competition and non solicitation covenants  which under various circumstances  may extend beyond the expiration or termination date depending upon the reason for such termination 
under such non competition covenants  the professional generally agrees not to offer or perform consulting services of the type performed during his employment  directly  or indirectly through another person or entity  in competition with us  within specified geographic areas  subject  in some cases  to certain exceptions 
generally  such professionals also agree not to solicit business regarding any case  matter or client upon which such professional worked on our behalf  or to solicit  hire  or influence the departure of  any of our employees  consultants or independent contractors 
under the general terms of his or her long term employment agreement  the professionals also agree to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and affirm that we are the owners of copyrights  trade marks  patents and inventions developed during the course of employment 
as of december   substantially all of the senior managing directors have entered into written employment agreements 
many of these employment agreements will expire between and because of the timing of our acquisitions and our initiative to enter into written long term employment agreements with our senior professionals 
our goal is to renew employment agreements when advisable and to stagger the expirations of the agreements if possible 
because of the high concentration of contract expirations between and  we may experience high turnover  loss of clients and engagements or difficulty staffing engagements  if we are unable to renegotiate employment agreements 
we have begun to focus on renegotiating new long term employment agreements with key senior managing directors 
in connection with those discussions  we may offer a senior managing director the opportunity to participate in all or a portion of the benefits under an incentive compensation package that includes cash  which may be in the form of an unsecured general recourse forgivable loan  and significant additional payments upon the execution and during the term of such employment agreement in the form of stock option and restricted stock awards or  alternatively  cash equivalents if we do not have adequate equity securities available under stockholder approved equity plans 
any new employment agreements entered into with senior managing directors may not have staggered termination dates  so that we could face similar retention issues at the end of the terms of those agreements 
this risk could be reduced in light of 
table of contents our intention to include automatic one year renewal options in our revised form of employment agreement beginning at the end of their initial terms unless either party provides prior notice to the other that he or us do not intend to renew 
while we hope that we enter into new long term employment agreements with a significant number of senior managing directors  there is no assurance we will do so 
the aggregate principal amount of all loans made to senior managing directors through could exceed million  of which some or all of the principal amount and accrued interest will be forgivable by us upon the passage of time  while complying with contractual requirements  or certain other events  such as death or disability or termination by us without cause or by the employee with good reason 
if all the other compensation features described above were to be implemented  the equity awards to such senior managing directors will be significant 
marketing and sales we rely primarily on referrals and our reputation to market our services to new and existing clients since most of our work is repeat work for existing clients or comes from referrals from existing clients or relationships with partners in major law firms or other professionals 
our professionals develop close working relationships with clients and often learn about new business opportunities from their frequent contacts with clients 
in marketing our services  we emphasize our experience  the quality of our services and our professionals particular areas of expertise  as well as our ability to quickly staff new engagements 
while we aggressively seek new business opportunities  we maintain high professional standards and carefully evaluate potential new client relationships and engagements before accepting them 
we employ full time people in our marketing and sales divisions who assist with the marketing of our consulting services 
clients we have cultivated long term relationships with many premier corporations  financial institutions  law firms and private equity firms 
in  we performed work for approximately  clients on about  matters  including about law firms  of which were rated among the top us law firms based on us revenues as measured by the american lawyer magazine  of the largest us bank holding companies based on total assets as of september  as reported by the federal reserve system  corporate clients that were among the fortune in  and a broad range of federal  state and local government agencies 
in  about of our revenues were derived from repeat or referral business 
our largest client represented less than of our revenues 
competition our business is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large organizations  such as the national accounting firms and the large management consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services  to small firms and independent contractors that provide one specialized service 
we compete primarily on the basis of institutional and individual reputations  ability to immediately staff a significant engagement  performance record  quality of work  range of services provided and existing client relationships 
to a lesser extent  we also compete on price  but the critical nature of our services typically reduces price to a secondary consideration 
since our business depends in a large part on professional relationships  our business has low barriers of entry for professionals  including our professionals  wanting to start their own firms or to change employers 

table of contents some national service providers are larger than we are and  on any given engagement  may have a competitive advantage over us with respect to one or more competitive factors 
the smaller local or regional firms  while not offering the range of services we provide  often are able to provide the lowest price on a specific engagement because of their lower overhead costs and proximity to the engagement 
patents  licenses and proprietary information we consider certain of our products and processes  including our trialmax comprehensive trial preparation software  proprietary and confidential 
we consider the ringtail casebook software that we acquired from the ringtail group on february  and the other technologies and software that we acquired in connection with the ringtail transaction to be proprietary and confidential 
a newer version of that software  ringtail legal  has since been issued 
we believe that our non patented software and intellectual property  particularly some of our process software and intellectual property  is important to our forensic litigation technology practice 
we rely upon non disclosure agreements and contractual agreements and a system of internal controls  including  confidentiality and invention disclosure agreements with our employees and independent contractors  and license agreements with third parties  to protect our proprietary information 
despite these safeguards  there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such information 
employees as of december   we had  total employees  including  revenue generating consultants  across us cities  london  england and melbourne  australia 
we also engage independent contractors to supplement our professionals on client engagements as needed 
most of our professionals have many years of experience in their field of practice  and many are well recognized for their expertise and experience 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining contracts or represented by a union 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause our actual results  future operations and financial performance to differ materially from those mentioned in our forward look statements 
our failure to retain qualified professionals or hire additional qualified professionals would have a negative effect on our future growth and financial performance as well as on client engagements  services and relationships 
our business involves the delivery of professional forensic litigation technology  corporate finance restructuring and economic consulting services 
in the consulting business  professional acumen  trust and relationships are critical elements of a company s ability to deliver high quality professional services 
our professionals have highly specialized skills 
they also develop strong bonds with the clients they service 
our continued success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our staff of professionals who have expertise  reputations and client relationships critical to maintaining and developing our business 
we face intense competition in recruiting and retaining highly qualified professionals that we must employ to continue our service offerings 
as of december   substantially all of the senior managing directors had written employment agreements with us 
many of our employment agreements will expire between and because of the timing of our acquisitions and our initiative to enter into written agreements with our senior professionals 
we monitor these expirations carefully to commence dialogues with professionals regarding their employment well in advance of the actual contract expiration dates 
our goal is to renew employment agreements when advisable and to stagger the expirations of the agreements if possible 
because of the high concentration of contract expirations between and  we may experience high turnover or other adverse consequences  such as higher costs  loss of clients and engagements  or difficulty staffing engagements  if we are unable to renegotiate employment arrangements or the costs of retaining qualified professionals become higher 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain enough qualified professionals to maintain or expand our business 
moreover  competition has been increasing our costs of retaining or hiring qualified professionals  a trend which could harm our operating margins and results of operations 
we have begun to focus on renegotiating new long term employment agreements with key senior managing directors 
in connection with those discussions  we may offer a senior managing director the opportunity to participate in all or a portion of the benefits under an incentive compensation package that includes cash  which may be in the form of an unsecured general recourse forgivable loan  and significant additional payments upon the execution and during the term of such employment agreement in the form of stock option and restricted stock awards or  alternatively  cash equivalents if we do not have adequate equity securities available under stockholder approved equity plans 
any new employment agreements entered into with senior managing directors may not have staggered termination dates  so that we could face similar retention issues at the end of the terms of those agreements  although this risk could be reduced in light of our intention to include automatic one year renewal options in the revised form of employment agreement beginning at the end of their initial terms unless either party provides to the other prior notice that he or us do no not intend to renew 
while we hope that we enter into new long term employment agreements with a significant number of senior managing directors  we have not yet and there is no assurance we will do so 
the aggregate principal amount of all loans made to senior managing directors through could exceed million  of which some or all of the principal amount and accrued interest could be forgivable by us upon the passage of time  while complying with contractual requirements  or certain other events  such as death or disability or termination by us without cause or by the employee with good reason 
if all the other compensation features described above were to be implemented  the equity awards to such senior managing directors would also be significant 

table of contents our clients may preclude us from representing multiple clients in connection with the same engagement or competitive matter  our other practices may be precluded from accepting engagements from clients with respect to the same or competitive matter for which another practice has been engaged to provide services  and to forego potential business prospects in order to win engagements  which could harm our revenues  results of operations and client relationships and engagements 
we follow internal practices to assess real and potential issues in the relationships between and among our clients  engagements  practices and professionals 
for example  we generally will not represent parties adverse to each other in the same matter 
under bankruptcy rules  we generally may not represent both a debtor and its creditors in the same proceeding 
under federal bankruptcy laws  we are required to notify the us trustee of real or potential conflicts 
the us trustee could find that we no longer meet the disinterestedness standard because of real or potential changes in our status as a disinterested party  and order us to resign 
in preference actions under bankruptcy law  we could be required to disgorge fees 
new acquisitions may result in us resigning from a current client engagement because of relationship issues that are not currently identifiable 
in addition  businesses that we acquire may not be free to accept engagements they could have accepted prior to our acquiring them because of relationship issues 
our inability to accept engagements from clients or prospective clients  represent multiple clients in connection with the same or competitive engagements  and any requirement that we resign from client engagements may negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
if our former professionals go into business in competition with us or join our competitors  our client engagements and relationships could decline  financial performance and growth could slow or decline  and employee morale could suffer  and we may not have legal recourse 
typically  our professionals have a close relationship with the clients they serve  not only based on their expertise but also on bonds of personal trust and confidence 
although our clients generally contract for services with us as a company  and not with individual professionals  in the event that professionals leave  such clients would not be prohibited from hiring those professionals to perform future engagements 
clients could also decide to transfer active engagements to professionals who leave 
the engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services 
typically  our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time 
furthermore  while in some cases  the termination of an ongoing engagement by a client could constitute a breach of the client s contract with us  we could decide that preserving the overall client relationship is more important than seeking damages for the breach  and for that or other reasons that are not currently identifiable  decide not to pursue any legal remedies that might be available to us 
we would make the determination whether to pursue any legal actions against a client on a case by case basis 
all of our written employment agreements with our senior managing directors include non competition and non solicitation arrangements 
these non competition agreements have generally been drafted to comply with state reasonableness standards 
however  states generally interpret non competition clauses narrowly 
therefore  a state may hold certain restrictions on competition to be unenforceable 
in the case of former ringtail employees residing in australia  the non competition provisions have been drafted to comply with australian law 
in the event an employee departs  we will consider any legal remedies we may have against such professional on a case by case basis 
however  we may decide that preserving cooperation and a professional relationship  or other concerns  outweigh the benefits of any possible legal recovery 
therefore  we may determine not to pursue legal action  even if available 
in the first quarter of  we experienced the unanticipated departures of about professionals in our former fti policano manzo restructuring practice 
we have strived to build relationships and reassure our professionals and clients of our interest in them and our ability to provide services comparable to those provided by the departing professionals 
those departures had a negative impact on our financial results for in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a monetary settlement of arbitration proceedings brought against those former employees and the company they formed to compete with us 

table of contents our profitability will suffer if we are not able to manage utilization and pricing rates of our professional staff 
we calculate the utilization rate for our professional staff by dividing the number of hours that all of our professionals worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for all of our professionals  assuming a hour work week and a week year 
available working hours include vacation and professional training days  but exclude holidays 
the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services and the number of hours our professionals are able to charge our clients for our services are affected by the level of expertise and experience of the professionals working on a particular engagement and  to a lesser extent  the pricing and staffing policies of our competitors 
if we fail to manage our utilization rates for our professionals or maintain or increase the hourly rates we charge our clients for our services  we may experience adverse consequences  such as non revenue generating professionals  the loss of clients and engagements and the inability to appropriately staff engagements  and our profitability will suffer 
for example  demand for our corporate finance restructuring professionals declined in early primarily as a result of general economic conditions  including the strengthening of the economy  the availability of credit  low interest rates  fewer mergers and acquisitions and fewer large bankruptcy proceedings 
our operating profit margins declined in due to the slow down in our corporate finance restructuring business and due to lower utilization rates in that practice and our recently acquired businesses relative to our historical experiences 
we also experienced lower utilization in our forensic litigation technology practice during late and the early part of resulting from the absorption of the professionals who joined us in connection with our acquisition of the dispute advisory services of kpmg llp 
many of the billable professionals that resigned during the first quarter of were among our highest utilized and billing professionals  which also contributed to our lower utilization rates and operating profit margins in during the year ended december   our overall utilization rate improved as compared to primarily due to larger client assignments and more robust market conditions in we rely heavily on our senior management team and practice leaders for the success of our business 
we rely heavily on our senior management team and practice leaders to manage our practices 
given the highly specialized nature of our services and the scale of our operations  these people must have a thorough understanding of our service offerings as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization 
if one or more members of our senior management team or our practice leaders leave and we cannot replace them with a suitable candidate quickly  we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly  and this could harm our business prospects  client relationships  employee morale and results of operations 
any claims involving the quality of our services could harm our overall professional reputation  which could harm our ability to compete for new business opportunities  retain and attract clients and engagements  and hire and retain qualified professionals 
many of our engagements involve complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment 
therefore  we are subject to the risk of professional liability 
often  our engagements involve matters that  if resolved unfavorably  may result in a severe impact on the client s business  cause the client a substantial monetary loss or prevent the client from pursuing business opportunities 
since our ability to attract new clients and generate engagements depends upon our ability to maintain a high degree of client satisfaction as well as our reputation among industry professionals  any claims against us involving the quality of our services may be more damaging than similar claims against businesses in other industries 
we do not generally indemnify our clients  however  in certain cases  such as with clients who are governmental agencies or authorities  we may agree to indemnify them and their affiliates against third party liabilities 
indemnification provisions are negotiated on a contract by contract basis and in some cases may be reciprocal or may be coupled with limitations on the amount and type of damages that can be recovered 

table of contents any claim by a client or a third party against us could expose us to professional or other liabilities in excess of our insurance limits 
we maintain a limited amount of liability insurance 
the damages and or expenses resulting from any successful claims against us  for indemnity or otherwise  in excess of our insurance limits would have to be borne directly by us and could seriously harm our profitability  financial resources and reputation 
our clients may terminate our engagements with little or no notice  which may cause us to experience unexpected declines in our profitability and utilization 
much of our business involves large client engagements that we staff with a substantial number of professionals 
the engagement letters that we typically enter into with clients do not obligate them to continue to use our services 
typically  our engagement letters permit clients to terminate our services at any time 
if our clients unexpectedly cancel engagements with us or curtail the scope of our engagements  we may be unable to replace the lost revenues from those engagements  quickly eliminate costs associated with those engagements  or quickly find other engagements to utilize our professionals 
any decrease in revenues without a corresponding reduction in our costs will likely harm our profitability 
we face intense competition in our business 
if we fail to compete effectively  we may miss new business opportunities or lose existing clients and our revenues and profitability may decline 
parties from whom we acquire assets may reenter the marketplace to compete with us in the future 
the market for our consulting services is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large organizations  such as the national accounting firms and the large management consulting companies that offer a broad range of consulting services  to small firms and independent contractors that provide one specialized service 
some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources  larger professional staffs and greater brand recognition than we do 
since our business depends in a large part on professional relationships  our business has low barriers of entry for professionals wanting to start their own firms 
in addition  it is relatively easy for professionals to change employers 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully for new business opportunities or retain our existing clients or professional employees 
in connection with our acquisitions  we generally obtain non solicitation agreements from the professionals we hire as well as non competition agreements from senior managers and professionals 
in some cases we enter into non competition or non solicitation arrangements generally with sellers 
we cannot assure you that any one or more of the parties from whom we acquire assets or a business who do not join us  or persons who join us if upon expiration or breach of their agreements not to compete or solicit will not compete with us in the future 
also  the duration of those agreements are limited ranging from three to eight years after the acquisition date 
certain activities may be carved out of or otherwise may not be prohibited by those arrangements 
also  in some cases we may agree to restraints on our ability to compete with the sellers of those businesses with respect to certain practice areas or locations 
competition may harm our expected revenues growth and results of operations and cause the actual profitability of the business to differ materially from our expectations and the expectations of the investing public 
a failure to meet these expectations could cause the price of our stock to decline 
in connection with the acquisition in of certain assets and liabilities of the us business recovery services brs division of pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc  we obtained a three year agreement from pwc not to compete with us 
on december   we filed an action in the supreme court of the state of new york against pwc seeking enforcement of the non competition covenants  damages  and injunctive and other equitable relief 
on november   we entered into a settlement and release in the action  which enforced the non compete until august  we may have difficulty integrating our acquisitions  or convincing clients to allow assignment of their contracts to us  with a consequent detrimental effect on our financial results 
the process of integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial  operational and managerial resources that would otherwise be 
table of contents available for the operation  development and expansion of our existing business 
to the extent that we have miscalculated our ability to integrate and properly manage any or all of our acquisitions  we may have difficulty in achieving our operating and strategic objectives 
a substantial amount of our growth has been due to acquisitions 
during  we completed three significant acquisitions lexecon  the former dispute advisory business of kpmg llp and ten eyck  all of which occurred in the fourth quarter 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the ringtail group 
ringtail is a leading developer of litigation support and knowledge management technologies for law firms 
on may   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of cambio from certain of the individual owners of cambio partners  the direct parent of cambio  and certain of its investors 
cambio is a leading provider of change management solutions for hospital and health systems 
on january   we completed our acquisition of competition policy associates  inc  which we refer to as compass 
compass is one of the top competition economics consulting firms in the world  with office in washington  dc and san francisco 
compass provides services that involve sophisticated economic analysis in the context of antitrust disputes  mergers and acquisitions  regulatory and policy debates  and general commercial litigation across a broad range of industries in the united states  europe and the pacific rim 
all of these acquisitions at this time  except compass  have been substantially integrated with fti 
some of the integration challenges we face include differences in corporate cultures and management styles  additional or conflicting government regulation  disparate company polices and practices and client conflict issues 
all of our acquisitions in  our ringtail and cambio acquisitions in and a portion of our compass acquisition in were structured as asset transactions 
asset transactions generally necessitate receipt of third party consents to assign client engagements 
all clients might not affirmatively consent to an assignment 
in addition  in some cases there are no written client contracts memorializing an engagement 
such engagements will only continue at the pleasure of those clients 
in certain cases  such as government contracts and bankruptcy engagements  the consents of clients cannot be solicited until after the acquisition has closed 
further  such contracts may be subject to security clearance requirements or bidding provisions with which we might not be able to comply 
there is no assurance that local  state and federal governments will agree to novate their contracts to us 
in addition  in an engagement that involves a bankruptcy case  we must make a filing with the applicable us trustee  at which time such us trustee may find that we are no longer disinterested 
in connection with such bankruptcy cases  we may be required to resign and to refund fees collected in connection with those engagements 
we could be responsible for returning fees even if they were not paid to us  but rather to the company from whom we acquired the business 
in some cases  we may not have legal recourse to demand that the seller of the business reimburse us 
our corporate finance restructuring practice has an increased risk of fee non payment 
many of our clients have engaged us because they are experiencing financial distress 
we recognize that these clients may not have sufficient funds to continue operations or to pay for our services 
we typically do not receive retainers before we begin performing services on a client s behalf in connection with a significant amount of our corporate finance restructuring business 
in the cases that we have received retainers  we cannot assure you that the retainers will adequately cover our fees for the services we perform on behalf of these clients 
we are not always able to obtain retainers from clients in bankruptcy as the bankruptcy court must approve our retainers for those clients 
even if a bankruptcy court approves our retainer or engagement  a bankruptcy court has the discretion to require us to return all  or a portion of  our fees 
therefore  we face the risk of non payment  which can result in write offs 
for the three years ended december   we wrote off a total of million  of uncollectible fees in all practices 
our total write offs exclude unbilled fee adjustments and amounts attributable to our applied sciences practice  which we sold in more write offs than we expect in any period would have a negative impact on our results of operations 

table of contents if the size  complexity and number of debt defaults  bankruptcy or restructuring actions or other factors affecting demand for our corporate finance restructuring services declines  or if economic conditions beyond our control result in a reduced demand for our forensic  economic  technology and other services  our revenues and profitability could suffer 
our corporate finance restructuring practice provides various restructuring and restructuring related services to companies in financial distress or their creditors or other stakeholders 
a number of factors outside of our control affect demand for our services 
these include the availability and level of lending activity  interest rates and over leveraging of companies  over expansion by various businesses  merger and acquisition activity  management problems  governmental regulations  and other general economic factors resulting in the decline in the economy in the us notwithstanding increases in debt  we have also seen a decline of the mega bankruptcy cases  resulting in a greater portion of our business being comprised of engagements relating to bankruptcy and restructuring matters involving mid size companies  primarily as a result of general economic conditions  including the strengthening of the economy  the availability of credit and low interest rates 
in our experience  mid size bankruptcy and restructuring engagements are more susceptible to cyclical factors such as holidays and vacations 
the shift to mid size engagements could result in lower utilization during the third and fourth quarters of any year due to these factors 
declines in demand for our restructuring  turnaround and bankruptcy services as well as smaller engagements could result in lower revenues and decrease our overall profitability 
our other practice groups  including forensic  litigation and economic consulting  also are driven by crisis situations that affect companies but which are outside of our control 
we are not able to predict the effect future events or changes to the us or global business environment could have on our operations 
changes to any of the factors described above as well as other events  including by way of example  tort reform  changes to laws and regulations  including recent changes to the bankruptcy code  decline in government enforcement  and alternative dispute resolution practices  or a decline in litigation  and declines in monetary damages or remedies that are sought  may have an adverse effect on one or more of our businesses 
if we fail to find suitable acquisition candidates  or if we are unable to take advantage of opportunistic acquisition situations  our ability to expand may be curtailed 
the number of suitable acquisition candidates may decline if the competition for acquisition candidates increases 
as a result  we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire 
alternatively  at the time an acquisition opportunity presents itself  internal and external pressures including  but not limited to  borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility or the availability of alternative financing  may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete an acquisition 
our ability to grow our business  particularly through acquisitions  may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be able to obtain financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
in any case  we may be unable to grow our business or expand our service offerings as quickly as we have in the past  and our profitability may decline 
we may not manage our growth effectively  and our profitability may suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth in recent years 
this rapid expansion of our business may strain our management team  human resources and information systems 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully 
table of contents manage the integration of any businesses we may acquire or that they will result in the financial  operational and other benefits that we anticipate 
to manage our growth successfully  we may need to add qualified managers and employees and periodically update our operating  financial and other systems  as well as our internal procedures and controls 
we also must effectively motivate  train and manage a larger professional staff 
such expansion may result in significant expenditures 
if we fail to add qualified managers or manage our growth effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
our revenues  operating income and cash flows are likely to fluctuate 
we have experienced fluctuating revenues  operating income and cash flows and expect that this will occur from time to time in the future 
we may experience fluctuations in our annual or quarterly revenues and operating income because of the timing of our client assignments  the types of assignments we are working on at different times  hiring trends and decreased productivity because of vacations taken by our professionals 
this means our profitability will likely decline if we experience an unexpected variation in the number or timing of client assignments or during the third quarter when substantial numbers of professionals take vacations  which reduces their utilization rates 
we may also experience future fluctuations in our cash flows because of increased compensation  including changes to our incentive compensation structure and the timing of those payments  which we generally pay during the first quarter of each year 
also  the timing of any future acquisitions and the cost of integrating them may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
a significant portion of lexecon s revenues results from relationships with clients and industry professionals maintained by daniel fischel  dennis carlton and joseph p 
kalt 
the loss of one or more of them could decrease our revenues and the profitability of lexecon 
the success of our acquisition of lexecon will depend upon our retention of daniel fischel  dennis carlton and joseph p 
kalt 
they have reputations in the field of economics for highly specialized expertise as well as important relationships with existing clients and industry professionals 
their reputations and relationships are critical to retaining and gaining new client engagements  particularly large  complex matters 
we have written five year employment agreements with messrs 
fischel  carlton and kalt 
the loss of messrs 
fischel  carlton or kalt could harm the success of our acquisition of the lexecon practice 
we may have a different system of governance and management from the companies from whom we make our acquisitions  which could cause senior professionals who join us from acquired companies to leave us 
our governance and management practices and policies do not mirror the policies and practices of acquired companies or their parents 
in some cases  different management practices and policies may lead to workplace dissatisfaction on the part of acquired professionals with our way of conducting business 
the loss of one or more key professionals may harm our business and results of operations 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes 
in august  we completed the offering of million of our senior notes due  and million of convertible senior subordinated notes due july  our senior secured bank credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit  of which million is available for borrowing as of december  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  
table of contents limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  and limit our ability to make future acquisitions 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive and  in the case of the senior secured credit facility  financial covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best interests 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debts 
despite current indebtedness levels  we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt 
this could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of the indentures governing our senior notes and our convertible notes do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from doing so 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next few years 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility or that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our senior secured credit facility  our senior notes or our convertible notes  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may be required to pay substantial amounts in cash to holders of the convertible notes at the time of conversion prior to maturity 
as a result of making cash payments on the convertible notes  we may not have sufficient cash to pay the principal of  or interest on  our other obligations  including the senior notes 
the senior notes are senior in right of payment to the convertible notes 
however  the convertible notes will mature on july   one year before the maturity of the senior notes 
therefore  we will be obligated to repay the holders of the convertible notes million before we are required to repay principal of the senior notes at maturity 
in addition  we may be required to pay substantial amounts in cash to holders of the convertible notes prior to their stated maturity at the time of conversion or upon a fundamental change 
upon conversion of the convertible notes  we will be required to pay to the holder of a convertible note a cash payment equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the notes being converted or the conversion value of those notes 
as a result  we may be required to pay significant amounts in cash to holders of the convertible notes upon conversion 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to pay the conversion consideration at the time of conversion 
the indenture governing the senior notes generally allows for these payments  and our senior secured credit facility permits these payments in some  but not all  circumstances 
however  payments of the convertible notes upon conversion could be construed to be a prepayment of principal on subordinated debt  and our existing and future senior debt may prohibit us from making those payments  or may restrict our ability to do so by requiring that we satisfy 
table of contents certain covenants relating to the making of restricted payments 
if we are unable to pay the conversion consideration  we could seek consent from our senior creditors to make the payment 
if we are unable to obtain their consent  we could attempt to refinance the debt 
if we were unable to obtain consent or refinance the debt  we would be prohibited from paying the cash portion of the conversion consideration  in which case we would have an event of default under the indenture governing the convertible notes 
an event of default under the convertible note indenture most likely would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes and under our senior secured credit facility 
the indenture governing the convertible notes provides that the convertible notes are convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events 
however  we generally will be unable to control timing of any conversion of the convertible notes 
as a result of making cash payments on the convertible notes  we may not have sufficient cash to pay the principal of  or interest on  the senior notes 
for example  if a significant amount of convertible notes were converted shortly before a regular interest payment date for the senior notes  we may not have sufficient cash to make the interest payment on the senior notes 
we may attempt to borrow under our senior secured credit facility to fund interest payments on the senior notes  but there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient availability under that or any successor facility or that our credit facility lenders will allow us to draw on that facility for the purpose of making payments on the senior notes 
our indebtedness is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries and will be required to be guaranteed by future subsidiaries including those organized or that join us in connection with an acquisition 
assets of the guarantors may not be available to satisfy our obligations under the notes and senior secured bank facility 
substantially all of our subsidiaries guarantee our senior notes and our convertible notes and our senior secured bank facility and their assets secure such indebtedness 
future subsidiaries  including those organized or acquired by us in connection with acquisitions  will be required to guarantee the notes and our senior secured bank debt and to pledge their assets as collateral for those obligations 
under the federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws  a guarantee can be voided  or claims in respect of a guarantee can be subordinated to all other debts of that guarantor if  among other things  the guarantor  at the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of such guarantee  and was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence  or was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor s remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur  or believed that it would incur  debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature 
in addition  any payment by that guarantor pursuant to its guarantee can be voided and required to be returned to the guarantor  or to a fund for the benefit of the creditors of the guarantor 
the measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws will vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred 
generally  however  a guarantor would be considered insolvent if the sum of its debts  including contingent liabilities  was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets  or if the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts  including contingent liabilities  as they become absolute and mature  or it could not pay its debts as they become due 

table of contents on the basis of historical financial information  recent operating history and other factors  we believe that each guarantor  after giving effect to its guarantee of our senior notes and our convertible notes  will not be insolvent  will not have unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged and will not have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature 
we cannot assure you  however  as to what standard a court would apply in making these determinations or that a court would agree with our conclusions in this regard 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture 
upon the occurrence of certain specific kinds of change of control events  we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding senior notes at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and special interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
however  it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of senior notes or that restrictions in our senior secured credit facility will not allow such repurchases 
in addition  certain important corporate events  such as leveraged recapitalizations  that would increase the level of our indebtedness  would not constitute a change of control under the indenture governing our senior notes
