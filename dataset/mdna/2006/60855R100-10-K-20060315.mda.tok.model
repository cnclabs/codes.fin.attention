item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a multi state managed care organization that arranges for the delivery of health care services to persons eligible for medicaid and other programs for low income families and individuals 
our objective is to become the leading managed care organization in the united states focused primarily on serving people who receive health care benefits through state sponsored programs for low income populations 
we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate 
premium revenue is fixed in advance of the periods covered and is not subject to significant accounting estimates 
for the year ended december   we received approximately of our premium revenue as a fixed amount per member per month  or pmpm  pursuant to our contracts with state medicaid agencies and other managed care organizations with which we operate as a subcontractor 
these premium revenues are recognized in the month members are entitled to receive health care services 
approximately of our premium revenue in the year ended december  was realized under a cost plus reimbursement agreement that our utah subsidiary has with that state 
we also received approximately of our premium revenue for the year ended december  in the form of birth payments one time payments for the delivery of children from the medicaid programs in new mexico  indiana  michigan  ohio and washington 
such payments are recognized as revenue in the month the birth occurs 
the state medicaid programs periodically adjust premium rates 
membership growth has been the primary reason for our increasing revenues 
we have increased our membership through both internal growth and acquisitions 
the following table sets forth the approximate number of members by state in the periods presented as of december  state california indiana michigan new mexico ohio n a utah washington total enrollment in our ohio hmo at december  was less than members 
however  we expect our ohio hmo enrollment to grow significantly in 
table of contents the following table details member months defined as the aggregation of each month s membership for the period by state for the years ended december    and state california indiana michigan new mexico ohio n a utah washington total enrollment in our ohio hmo at december  was less than members 
however  we expect our ohio hmo enrollment to grow significantly in other operating revenue primarily includes fee for service revenue generated by our clinics in california and savings sharing revenues in utah  california  and michigan  where we receive additional incentive payments from the states if medical costs are less than prescribed amounts 
the savings sharing provisions of our contract with the state of michigan are no longer in effect  and we recognized our last savings sharing revenue in that state in the second quarter of other operating revenue also includes revenue earned by our new mexico hmo for performing certain administrative services for the state of new mexico 
the new mexico hmo ceased providing such services effective july  our operating expenses include expenses related to the provision of medical care services and salary  general and administrative  or g a  costs 
our results of operations depend on our ability to effectively manage expenses related to health benefits and accurately predict costs incurred 
expenses related to medical care services include two components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include payments to physicians  hospitals  and providers of ancillary medical services  such as pharmacy  laboratory  and radiology services 
medically related administrative costs include expenses relating to health education  quality assurance  case management  disease management  hour on call nurses  member services  and compliance 
in general  primary care physicians are paid on a capitation basis a fixed amount per member per month regardless of actual utilization of medical services  while specialists and hospitals are paid on a fee for service basis 
for the year ended december   approximately of our direct medical expenses were related to fees paid to providers on a fee for service basis  with the balance paid on a capitation basis 
physician providers not paid on a capitated basis are paid on a fee schedule set by the state or by our contracts with these providers 
we pay hospitals in a variety of ways  including fee for service  per diems  diagnostic related groups  capitation and case rates 
capitation payments are fixed in advance of periods covered and are not subject to significant accounting estimates 
these payments are expensed in the period the providers are obligated to provide services 
fee for service payments are expensed in the period services are provided to our members 
medical care costs include actual historical claims experience and estimates of medical expenses incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
monthly  we estimate our ibnr based on a number of factors  including prior claims experience  inpatient hospital utilization data  and prior authorization of medical services 
as part of this review  we also consider estimates of amounts to cover uncertainties related to fluctuations in provider billing patterns  claims payment patterns  membership  and medical cost trends 
these estimates are adjusted monthly as more information becomes available 
we employ our own actuary 
we believe that our process for estimating ibnr is adequate  but medical care costs have  in the past  exceeded such estimates  and there can be no assurance that medical care costs will not exceed such estimates in the future 

table of contents g a costs are largely comprised of wage and benefit costs related to our employee base and other administrative expenses 
some g a services are provided locally  while others are delivered to our health plans from a centralized location 
the major centralized functions are claims processing  information systems  finance and accounting services  and legal and regulatory services 
locally provided functions include marketing to the extent permitted by law and regulation  plan administration  and provider relations 
included in g a expenses are premium taxes for the california hmo beginning july   the michigan hmo beginning in the second quarter of  the new mexico hmo beginning with its acquisition on july  and the washington hmo 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios 
all ratios with the exception of the medical care ratio are shown as a percentage of total revenue 
the medical care ratio is shown as a percentage of premium and other operating revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium and other operating revenue earned and the cost of health care 
year ended december  premium revenue other operating revenue investment income total revenue medical care ratio salary  general and administrative expenses operating income net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  premium revenue premium revenue for was  million  up million from  million for membership growth contributed million to the increase in premium revenue 
year end enrollment increased to  members at december   from  members at the same date of the prior year 
membership growth was primarily the result of acquisitions in san diego  california effective june   the start up of our indiana hmo effective april   and the full year benefit of acquisitions made during in washington  new mexico  and michigan 
member months for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  the remaining million increase in premium revenue was attributable to increases in premium rates and proportionally greater increases in membership in those states with higher premium rates 
other operating revenue other operating revenue decreased to million for from million for during  savings sharing income recognized by our utah hmo declined by million 
revenue earned by our california medical clinics declined by million in revenue earned by our new mexico hmo during for performing certain administrative services for the state was million higher in than in our new mexico hmo terminated its involvement in this program effective july  
table of contents investment income investment income for increased to million from million for due to greater average invested balances and higher investment yields 
medical care costs medical care costs for were  million  as compared with million for medical care costs as a percentage of premium and other operating revenue the medical care ratio increased to in as compared to for the increase in the medical care ratio during resulted in sharply lower net income when compared to at the close of the second quarter of  we identified four issues that were adversely affecting medical care costs 
increased hospital costs 
hospital costs were adversely affected by a shift in utilization to higher cost hospitals during hospital costs were more favorable in the second half of than in the first half of the year 
the more favorable cost trends in the second half appear to be the result of improvements in both utilization and unit costs 
increased costs from catastrophic cases 
we experienced increases in both the incidence and the acuity of catastrophic cases during the financial impact of such cases has outpaced membership growth 
catastrophic cases declined during the second half of when compared with the first half of the year 
increased maternity costs in michigan and washington 
during we experienced increased costs and increased utilization of maternity services  particularly in western and northeastern michigan and in washington 
the cost of providing these services has grown faster than the revenue we receive for providing the services 
increased outpatient costs 
increased outpatient costs were partially the result of a severe flu season in washington and the unexpectedly delayed arrival of flu season in michigan 
outpatient costs were more favorable in the second half of than in the first half of the year 
during the second half of  we implemented a number of initiatives to better control medical costs 
we believe that those initiatives already implemented have modestly contributed to the improved results in the second half of in particular  we believe that the following actions have contributed to lowered medical cost trends in the second half of when compared to the first half of utilization of more cost effective hospitals where such facilities are available  enhanced monitoring of utilization at hospitals where more cost effective alternatives are not available  increased investment in medical and utilization management resources  implementation of risk sharing arrangements with our state payors  adjustment of premium rates to reflect the increased cost of providing care to specific member populations  and increased oversight of our claims payment process 
nevertheless  we can give no assurances that the improved performance is not at least partially the result of factors beyond our control  nor can we give any assurances that the improved medical cost trends will continue 
hospital costs for include million of expense related to the settlement and anticipated settlement of certain claims made against us by various hospitals 
these claims seek additional or first time reimbursement for services ostensibly provided to our members that purportedly were not paid or were underpaid by us

table of contents membership growth contributed million to the increase in premium revenue 
year end enrollment increased to  members at december   from  members at the same date of the prior year 
member months for the year ended december  increased by to  from  for the year ended december  year end enrollment increased by at our washington hmo and by at our michigan hmo between and the transfer of membership from other managed care companies was the primary source of enrollment growth in both states 
our new mexico acquisition effective july  added  members to our total year end enrollment the remaining million increase in premium revenue was attributable to increases in premium rates and proportionally greater increases in membership in those states with higher premium rates 
premium revenue on a per member per month basis is substantially higher at our new mexico hmo than at our other hmos 
other operating revenue other operating revenue increased to million for from million for other operating revenue for included million of savings sharing income recognized by our utah hmo 
our utah hmo recognized no savings sharing income prior to for  our michigan hmo recognized approximately million in savings sharing income 
our michigan hmo s contract with the state no longer contains risk sharing provisions and no risk sharing revenue was recognized by the michigan hmo subsequent to the second quarter of other than the amounts recognized by our utah and michigan hmos for savings sharing  other operating revenue consisted primarily of revenue earned by our california medical clinic operations approximately million for both and and approximately million of income earned by our new mexico hmo during for performing certain administrative services for the state 
investment income investment income for increased to million from million for due to greater average invested balances and higher investment yields 
medical care costs medical care costs for were million  representing of premium and other operating revenue for all of  as compared with million  representing of premium and other operating revenue for all of the increase in the medical care ratio is due in large part to increases in enrollment in states and programs that experience higher medical care ratios than our company wide average 
increased aged  blind and disabled membership in our michigan hmo and the acquisition of our new mexico hmo  which has traditionally experienced a higher medical care ratio than our other hmos  were major contributors to the higher medical care ratio

acquisitions on june   we transitioned approximately  medi cal and healthy families members living in san diego county  california into our california hmo from sharp health plan sharp and universal care  inc  a california corporation universal 
we paid total consideration of million in the sharp transaction 
further consideration may be paid to sharp through may  under an earn out provision which compares the excess of medical revenues over medical expenses of the acquired contracts against an annual target during the months after closing 
such further consideration may not exceed million 
we paid total consideration of million in the universal transaction 
on december  we acquired the capital stock of phoenix national insurance company phoenix for million 
phoenix is licensed in forty eight states and the district of columbia 
effective january   we changed the name of phoenix to molina healthcare insurance company 
we intend to use molina healthcare insurance company as a vehicle for developing new products  services  and markets that meet the health care delivery needs of persons eligible for medicaid and other programs for low income families and individuals 
liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from premium revenue  savings sharing income  services provided on a fee for service basis at our clinics  and investment income 
our primary uses of cash include the payment of expenses related to medical care services  g a expenses  and acquisitions 
we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment of claims for related health care services  with the exception of our utah hmo 
additionally  because we generally receive premium revenue in advance of payment for the related medical care costs with the exception of our utah hmo  our cash has increased during periods when we experienced enrollment growth 
our ability to support the increase in membership with existing infrastructure also allows us to retain a larger portion of the additional premium revenue as profit 
at december   we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively 
at december  and december   our investments were million and million  respectively 

table of contents our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital prescribed by the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of december   all of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
barring any change in regulatory requirements  we believe that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through we also believe that our cash resources and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our operations  regulatory requirements  and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
our restricted cash consists principally of certificates of deposit and treasury securities with maturities of up to months 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital  and maximize total return on invested assets  all in a manner consistent with state requirements 
as of december   we invested a substantial portion of our cash in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
as of december   our investments consisted solely of investment grade debt securities  all of which are classified as current assets 
our investment policies require that all of our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate securities and variable rate securities  for which interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
two professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their funds 
our restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit and treasury securities with maturities of up to months 
the average annualized portfolio yield for the years ended december    and was approximately   and  respectively 
net cash provided by operations was million for and million for while we had substantially lower net income in than in  changes in working capital accounts principally an increase in medical claims and benefits payable offset the decrease to cash provided by operations generated by our reduced net income 
the increase in net cash provided by operations for when compared to was due to the following factors decreased net income million lower in  increased depreciation and amortization expense million higher in  increased medical claims and benefits payable a source of million in compared to a source of million in  changes in accounts receivable balances  which were a use of million in compared to a use of million in  changes in miscellaneous working capital accounts a source of million in compared to a source of million in 
credit facility on march   we entered into an amended and restated five year secured credit agreement for a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders 
the credit facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
this credit facility replaced the facility that we had entered into on march  the credit facility has a term of five years and all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will be due and payable on march  subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions  we may increase the credit facility to up to million 

table of contents borrowings under the credit facility are based  at our election  on the london interbank deposit  or libor  rate or the base rate plus an applicable margin 
the base rate will equal the higher of bank of america s prime rate or above the federal funds rate 
we also pay a commitment fee on the total unused commitments of the lenders under the credit facility 
the applicable margins and commitment fee are based on our ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda 
the applicable margins will range between and for libor loans and between and for base rate loans 
the commitment fee will range between and 
in addition  we will pay a fee for each letter of credit issued under the credit facility equal to the applicable margin for libor loans and a customary fronting fee 
as with our prior credit facility  our obligations under the amended and restated credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and by a pledge of the capital stock of our michigan  new mexico  utah  and washington hmo subsidiaries 
at june   we were not in compliance with certain financial ratio covenants  constituting an event of default under the credit agreement 
in october  we entered into an amendment and waiver pursuant to which the lenders waived the event of default under the credit agreement  including the financial covenants 
in connection with the amendment and waiver we incurred fees of  which were capitalized as deferred financing cost to be amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the amended credit agreement includes usual and customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including covenants limiting liens  mergers  asset sales  other fundamental changes  debt  acquisitions  dividends and other distributions  capital expenditures  and investments 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to total consolidated ebitda of not more than to at any time and a fixed charge coverage ratio of to for the quarter ended september  and thereafter ranging from to for the quarter ended june  up to to for all quarters ending after december  at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit agreement 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions at december   our principal operations are conducted through the seven hmos operating in california  indiana  michigan  new mexico  ohio  utah  and washington 
the hmos are subject to state laws that  among other things  may require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment  and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as their sole stockholder 
to the extent the subsidiaries must comply with these regulations  they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us 
the net assets in these subsidiaries  after intercompany eliminations  which may not be transferable to us in the form of loans  advances  or cash dividends was million at december   and million at december  the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules effective december   which  if implemented by the states  set new minimum capitalization requirements for insurance companies  hmos  and other entities bearing risk for health care coverage 
the requirements take the form of risk based capital rules 
these hmo rules  which may vary from state to state  have been adopted in michigan  new mexico  indiana  ohio  utah and washington 
california has not adopted risk based capital requirements for hmos and has not formally given notice of its intention to do so 
the national association of insurance commissioners hmo rules  if adopted by california  may increase the minimum capital required for that state 
as of december   our hmos had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus of approximately million 
all of our hmos were in compliance with the minimum capital requirements 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we use estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures 
the determination of our liability for claims and medical benefits payable is 
table of contents particularly important to the determination of our financial position and results of operations and requires the application of significant judgment by our management and  as a result  is subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our medical care costs include actual historical claims experience and estimates for medical care costs incurred but not reported to us ibnr 
we  together with our independent actuaries  estimate medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based upon historical data adjusted for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of health care services  and other relevant factors 
the estimation methods and the resulting reserves are frequently reviewed and updated  and adjustments  if necessary  are reflected in the period known 
we also record reserves for estimated referral claims related to medical groups under contract with us that are financially troubled or insolvent and that may not be able to honor their obligations for the payment of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses are not expected to be significant 
in applying this policy  we use judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions for determining the required estimates 
while we believe our estimates are adequate  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
in assessing the adequacy of accruals for medical claims liabilities  we consider our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our knowledge of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
the most significant estimates involved in determining our claims liability concern the determination of claims payment completion factors and trended per member per month cost estimates 
for the fifth month of service prior to the reporting date and earlier  we estimate our outstanding claims liability based upon actual claims paid  adjusted for estimated completion factors 
completion factors seek to measure the cumulative percentage of claims expense that will have been paid for a given month of service as of a date subsequent to that month of service 
completion factors are based upon historical payment patterns 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we changed our completion factors for the fifth through the twelfth months preceding that date by the percentages indicated 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  as the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost reimbursement contract 
amounts are in thousands 
increase decrease in estimated completion factors increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable 
table of contents for the four months of service immediately prior to the reporting date  actual claims paid are not a reliable measure of our ultimate liability  given the delay inherent between the patient physician encounter and the actual submission of a claim for payment 
for these months of service we estimate our claims liability based upon trended per member per month cost estimates 
these estimates reflect recent trends in payments and expense  utilization patterns  authorized services  and other relevant factors 
the following table reflects the change in our estimate of claims liability as of december  that would have resulted had we altered our trend factors by the percentages indicated 
our utah hmo is excluded from these calculations  as the majority of the utah business is conducted under a cost reimbursement contract 
amounts are in thousands 
increase decrease in trended per member per month cost estimates increase decrease in medical claims and benefits payable assuming a hypothetical change in both completion factors and per member per month cost estimates from those used in our calculation of ibnr at december   net income for the year ended december  would increase or decrease by approximately million  or 
per diluted share  net of tax 
commitments and contingencies we lease office space and equipment under various operating leases 
as of december   our lease obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and an aggregate of million thereafter 
we are not an obligor to or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party 
we are not a party to off balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases which are disclosed in the commitments and contingencies section of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and the notes thereto 
we have in the past made certain advances and loans to related parties  which are discussed in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report and the notes thereto 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our contractual obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the contractual obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
amounts are in thousands 
and beyond operating lease obligations purchase commitments other commitments total contractual obligations during the second quarter of we made an equity investment of approximately million in a medical service provider that provides certain medical services to our members 
upon the achievement by the medical service provider of certain benchmarks prior to december  we are obligated to invest an additional million 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and restricted investments 
we invest a substantial portion of our cash in a portfolio of highly liquid money market securities 
professional portfolio managers operating under documented investment guidelines manage our investments 
restricted investments are invested principally in certificates of deposit 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to payors consisting principally of the governments of each state in which our hmo subsidiaries operate 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  investments of million  and restricted investments of million 
the cash equivalents consist of highly liquid securities with original maturities of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash 
as of december   our investments consist solely of investment grade debt securities  all of which are classified as current assets 
our investment policies require that all of our investments have final maturities of ten years or less excluding auction rate and variable rate securities where interest rates are periodically reset and that the average maturity be four years or less 
the restricted investments consist of interest bearing deposits and treasury securities required by the respective states in which we operate 
investments and restricted investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
all non restricted investments are maintained at fair market value on the balance sheet 
all restricted investments are carried at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
we have the ability to hold these restricted investments until maturity and  as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
inflation we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through contracts with independent providers of health care services 
through these contracted providers  our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies will mitigate health care cost inflation  competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from health care providers and customers  applicable regulations  or other factors may affect our ability to control health care costs 
compliance costs our health plans are regulated by both state and federal government agencies 
regulation of managed care products and health care services is an evolving area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and rules occur frequently 
compliance with such laws and rules may lead to additional costs related to the implementation of additional systems  procedures and programs that we have not yet identified
