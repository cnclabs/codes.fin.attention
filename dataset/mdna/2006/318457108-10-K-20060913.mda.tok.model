item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the caption risk factors 
general we are principally a retailer  servicer and underwriter of non standard personal automobile insurance  based in nashville  tennessee 
non standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals who are categorized as non standard because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors  including payment history  payment preference  failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage  driving record and or vehicle type 
generally  our customers are required by law to buy a minimum amount of automobile insurance 
prior to our april  acquisition of usauto holdings  inc  we were engaged in pursuing opportunities to acquire one or more operating companies 
in addition  we marketed for sale a portfolio of foreclosed real estate 
we will continue to market the remaining real estate held  consisting of two tracts of land in san antonio  texas  and will attempt to sell it on a basis that provides us with the best economic return 
we do not anticipate any new investments in real estate 
as of september   we leased and operated retail locations  staffed by employee agents 
our employee agents exclusively sell insurance products either underwritten or serviced by us 
as of june   we wrote non standard personal automobile insurance in states and were licensed in additional states 
the following table shows the changes in the number of our retail locations for the periods presented 
retail location counts are based upon the date that a location commenced writing business 
in prior years  we had previously reported this information based upon the date that a location was leased and first incurred operating expenses 
count information for all prior periods presented has been restated to conform to the current period s method of presentation 
under the prior basis of presentation  we would have reported a total of locations leased at june  year ended june  retail locations beginning of year opened acquired closed retail locations end of year the following table shows the breakdown of our retail locations by state for the periods presented

table of contents our consolidated financial statements now vary in important respects from our historical consolidated financial statements due to the acquisition of usauto 
for the year ended june   the recorded financial results reflect twelve months of our previous operations  but only the two months of results of the insurance operations following the april  acquisition date 
the years ended june  and reflect the results from our insurance operations for the full year periods 
the acquisition of usauto was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the consideration consisted of million in cash   shares of our common stock issued at closing and  shares issued in upon the attainment of certain financial targets 
the aggregate purchase price of million was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
total goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded from the acquisition were million  which was net of a million reduction in our deferred tax allowance based upon our projections of usauto s future taxable income 
we have also since acquired certain assets of insurance agencies operating in texas and chicago  illinois and now write business in these areas through company operated retail locations 
these assets were acquired for a total of million in cash and resulted in total goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million 
our results for the year ended june  included expenses that have been discontinued as a result of the acquisition of usauto 
these principally consisted of compensation to employees who were terminated in connection with the acquisition 
however  the subsequent periods include  as will future periods  the cost of the advisory services agreement with an entity controlled by donald j 
edwards  one of our directors and our former president and chief executive officer  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these items have been incorporated into the presentation of pro forma operating results for the year ended june   which assumes that the acquisition of usauto occurred on july  consolidated results of operations overview our primary focus is the selling  servicing and underwriting of non standard personal automobile insurance 
our real estate and corporate segment consists of activities related to the disposition of foreclosed real estate held for sale  interest expense associated with debt  other general corporate overhead expenses and acquisition activities prior to the usauto acquisition in april the years ended june  and reflect the results of our insurance operations for the full year periods  while the year ended june  reflects the results of our acquisition activities and the real estate operations for the full year  and the results of our insurance operations for the two months following the date of the usauto acquisition 
in addition to the actual results  we also discuss pro forma operating results for the year ended june  that assume that the usauto acquisition occurred on july  
table of contents the following tables show the results of operations for our insurance operations and real estate and corporate segments for the periods presented proforma actual unaudited year ended june  year ended june  insurance operations in thousands revenues premiums earned commissions and fees transaction service fee ceding commissions from reinsurer investment income other gains losses total revenues expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses operating expenses depreciation and amortization total expenses income before income taxes proforma actual unaudited year ended june  year ended june  real estate and corporate in thousands revenues gains on sales of foreclosed real estate investment income total revenues expenses operating expenses stock based compensation depreciation interest expense total expenses income loss before income taxes our insurance operations derive revenues from selling  servicing and underwriting non standard personal automobile insurance policies in states 
we conduct our underwriting operations through two insurance company subsidiaries  first acceptance insurance company  inc formerly known as usauto insurance company  inc and first acceptance insurance company of georgia  inc formerly known as village auto insurance company  inc our insurance operations revenues are primarily derived from premiums earned  including policy and renewal fees  from i sales of policies issued by our insurance company subsidiaries  net of the portion of those premiums ceded to reinsurers  and ii the sales of policies issued by our managing general agency mga subsidiaries that are assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries through quota share reinsurance  fee income  including installment billing fees on policies written as well as fees for other ancillary services principally a motor club product  a transaction service fee for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago agencies whose business we acquired for the period from january  through december   commission income paid by our reinsurer to us for ceded premiums ceasing with the september  non renewal of our quota share reinsurance  and investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries 

table of contents the following table presents gross premiums earned by state and includes policies written by the insurance company subsidiaries and policies issued by our mga subsidiaries on behalf of other insurance companies that are assumed by one of the insurance company subsidiaries through quota share reinsurance 
prior to may  we were not licensed to write insurance in alabama and therefore one of our insurance companies assumed a percentage of the business written in alabama through an mga subsidiary 
the assumed percentage was through february   from february  through february   and following february  since may  all new alabama business has been written by one of our insurance company subsidiaries on a direct basis 
although we are licensed in texas  we currently write some business in texas through the texas county mutual insurance company system that is assumed by one of the insurance company subsidiaries 
for the year ended june  and for the months of july and august of  we ceded of our gross premiums earned to a reinsurer under a quota share reinsurance agreement that was non renewed effective september  premiums ceded after september  reflect only the cost of catastrophic reinsurance 
effective april   we elected to not renew our catastrophic reinsurance 
pro forma actual unaudited year ended june  year ended june  gross premiums earned georgia alabama florida tennessee texas ohio illinois indiana missouri mississippi pennsylvania south carolina total gross premiums earned premiums ceded premiums not assumed total net premiums earned the following table presents the change in the total number of policies in force for the insurance operations for the periods presented 
policies in force increase as a result of new policies issued and decrease as a result of policies that cancel or expire and are not renewed 
year ended june  actual pro forma policies in force beginning of period acquired net increase during period policies in force end of period insurance companies present a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability 
the components of the combined ratio are as follows loss ratio loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability 
we calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned  net of ceded reinsurance 
expense ratio expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of operating expenses to premiums earned 
this is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations 
we calculate this ratio on a net basis as a percentage of net premiums earned 
insurance operating expenses are reduced by fee income from insureds and ceding commissions received from our quota share reinsurer as 
table of contents compensation for the costs we incurred in servicing this business on their behalf 
our expense ratios for fiscal and exclude expenses and fee income related to incidental mga operations 
for fiscal  our operating expenses are reduced by the transaction service fee we received for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago agencies whose business we acquired 
combined ratio combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income 
the following table presents the combined ratios for the insurance operations on both an actual and a pro forma basis for the periods presented 
pro forma unaudited actual year ended year ended june  june  loss and loss adjustment expense expense combined the invested assets of the insurance operations are generally highly liquid and consist substantially of readily marketable  investment grade  municipal and corporate bonds and collateralized mortgage obligations 
at june   approximately of our fixed maturities portfolio was tax exempt 
all cash equivalents are taxable 
we invest in certain securities issued by political subdivisions in the states of georgia and tennessee  as these type of investments enable our insurance company subsidiaries to obtain premium tax credits 
investment income is composed primarily of interest earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
realized gains and losses on our investment portfolio may occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates and changes in the credit quality of securities held 
the non standard personal automobile insurance industry is cyclical in nature 
in the past  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity 
if new competitors enter this market  existing competitors may attempt to increase market share by lowering rates 
such conditions could lead to reduced prices  which would negatively impact our revenues and profitability 
however  we believe that between and  the underwriting results in the personal automobile insurance industry improved as a result of favorable pricing and competitive conditions that allowed for broad increases in rate levels by insurers 
rates and premium levels for non standard automobile insurance have stabilized or slightly increased thus far in year ended june  compared with year ended june  consolidated results net income for the year ended june  was million  compared with million for the year ended june  net income per share was and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  for the year ended june  and and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  for the year ended june  total revenues for the year ended june  increased from million to million over the same period last year 
the income tax expense benefit for the years ended june  and include decreases in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively 
such decreases were the result of taxable income for these years exceeding the estimates used by management in establishing the valuation allowances at june  and  respectively  in addition to revisions in management s estimates for our future taxable income based on the results for the most recent fiscal years 
net income per share for the year ended june  was increased by and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  as a result of the change in the valuation allowance 
net income per share for the year ended june  was increased by and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  as a result of the change in the valuation allowance 

table of contents net income per share for the year ended june  included gains on sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale of on a diluted basis compared with gains of for the year ended june  insurance operations income before income taxes was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june  premiums earned total gross premiums earned  before the effects of reinsurance  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  this increase was due to the development of new stores in existing states as well as our expansion into new states 
of this increase  million was attributable to the expansion of our business into florida and texas 
overall  the number of insured policies in force at june  increased over the same date in from  to  at june   the number of operating retail locations or stores was as compared with stores at june  net premiums earned increased for the year ended june  over the same period last year 
in addition to the increase in total gross premiums earned  net premiums earned also increased as a result of two changes involving reinsurance 
net premiums earned increased as a result of the change in the assumed reinsurance percentage for our alabama business written through other insurance companies from to effective february  for the year ended june   million in premiums earned in alabama were not assumed by us 
we are now licensed in alabama and  starting in may  we began writing all new policies in alabama on a direct basis 
as a result  in alabama  we no longer incur the contractual costs associated with writing business through another insurance company 
net premiums earned for the year ended june  also increased as the result of eliminating our quota share reinsurance effective september  this reinsurance was in effect for two months of the year ended june  and resulted in an million reduction in net premiums earned  which we ceded to the reinsurer 
commissions and fees and transaction service fee commissions and fees declined as a percentage of net premiums earned during the year ended june  compared with the prior year as a result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance and increasing the assumed reinsurance percentage for our alabama business 
ceding commissions from our reinsurer were eliminated with the non renewal of the quota share reinsurance agreement 
total revenues for the year ended june  included a million transaction service fee earned in connection with the chicago acquisition for servicing the run off business previously written by the chicago agencies whose assets we acquired on january  investment income investment income increased primarily as a result of the increase in invested assets as a result of our growth and to a lesser extent as we shifted the portfolio from tax exempt to taxable investments 
the weighted average investment yield for our fixed maturities portfolio was at june  with an effective duration of years 
the yield for the comparable lehman brothers indices at june  was 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  for the year ended june   we experienced a positive development for losses occurring in prior accident periods of million which we believe was attributable to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process and was not the result of any individual factor 
the loss ratio for the year ended june  increased primarily as a result of higher loss ratios in our expansion states and from an increase in storm losses 

table of contents operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to the addition of new retail locations including those acquired in chicago and expenses  such as advertising  employee agent compensation  rent and premium taxes that vary along with the increase in net premiums earned 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the expense ratio for the year ended june  was positively impacted by an additional ceding commission of million or  which was recorded based upon the favorable loss experience during the last year of the quota share reinsurance which was non renewed effective september  operating expenses incurred for new retail locations also contributed to the increase in the expense ratio for the year ended june  in addition  the expense ratio increased as a result of declining fee income from ancillary products which reduces expenses in calculating the expense ratio  and the fact that this fee income was spread over a larger base of net premiums earned as a result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance 
overall  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  real estate and corporate income before income taxes for the year ended june  was million versus a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  the year ended june  included gains on the sales of foreclosed real estate held for sale of million compared with million for the year ended june  investment income declined from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  primarily due to a reduction in the amount of invested assets 
other operating expenses primarily include other general corporate overhead expenses 
during the year ended june   we incurred severance costs of million in connection with the resignation of our former chief financial officer 
in addition  for the year ended june   we incurred million of interest expense in connection with borrowings related to the chicago acquisition 
year ended june  compared with year ended june  actual consolidated results net income for the year ended june  was million  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended june  the fiscal year results reflect only the two months of insurance operating results following the april  acquisition of usauto 
prior to this date  the results for the year ended june  reflect real estate operations and the costs associated with acquisition opportunities 
the fiscal year results also include severance costs to our former employees incurred as a result of the usauto acquisition 
net income per share for the year ended june  was and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  compared with a net loss per share of on both a basic and diluted basis for the year ended june  the weighted average shares outstanding increased as a result of the additional shares issued in the april rights offering and the usauto acquisition  as well as the  contingent shares issued in connection with the usauto acquisition 
the income tax benefit for the year ended june  includes a million decrease in the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset 
such decrease was a result of taxable income for the year ended june  exceeding the estimate used by management in establishing the valuation allowance at june  in addition to a revision in management s estimate for our future taxable income based on the results for the most recent fiscal year 
net income per share for the year ended june  was increased by and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively  as a result of this change in the valuation allowance 

table of contents pro forma consolidated results on a pro forma basis  net income for the year ended june  was million 
pro forma net income per share for the year ended june  was and on a basic and diluted basis  respectively 
actual results insurance operations for the year ended june   the insurance operations recorded income before income taxes of million 
the combined ratio for this period was  which includes a loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of and an expense ratio of 
pro forma results insurance operations on a pro forma basis  income before income taxes for the year ended june  was million compared with actual income before income taxes of million for the year ended june  premiums earned net premiums earned increased by to million for the year ended june  from million on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  a significant part of this increase is the result of eliminating our quota share reinsurance on the september  renewal date 
as a result  our reinsurance was only in effect for two months of year ended june  and for all of the year ended june  had we renewed the quota share reinsurance  net premiums earned would have been reduced by million for the year ended june  overall  the number of insured policies in force at june  increased over the same date in net premiums earned for the year ended june  also increased as a result of the texas operations  which were acquired effective january  in addition to texas  during the year ended june   we also commenced operations in illinois  florida and pennsylvania 
during the year ended june   the number of stores in operation increased by  from stores at june  to stores at june  included in the fiscal figure are the stores acquired in texas on january  in addition to the above factor  net premiums earned during the year ended june  also increased as we increased the assumed reinsurance percentage for our alabama business written through other insurance companies from to effective february   and from to effective february  as a result of these changes  net premiums earned increased by million for the year ended june  we are now licensed in alabama and  starting in may  we began writing all new policies in alabama on a direct basis 
as a result  in alabama  we no longer incur the contractual costs associated with writing business through another insurance company 
to a lesser extent  net premiums earned also increased as we continued to write more of our insurance business in georgia through our insurance company subsidiaries rather than through our mga operations for other insurance companies 
gross premiums earned through the georgia mga operations decreased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  commissions and fees and ceding commissions from reinsurer as a result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance and shifting the insurance underwriting from the mga operations to our insurance company subsidiaries  commissions and fees declined as a percentage of net premiums earned during the year ended june  compared with the prior year and ceding commissions from our reinsurer also decreased 
the year ended june   however  includes an additional ceding commission of million  which has been recorded based upon the favorable loss experience during the last contract year of the quota share reinsurance program which was non renewed effective september  investment income investment income increased primarily as a result of the increase in invested assets as a result of our growth 
the weighted average investment yield for our fixed maturities portfolio was at june  with a duration of years 
the yield for the comparable lehman brothers indices at june  was 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expenses the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio increased to for the year ended june  from on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  we did not experience any significant development for losses occurring in prior accident periods 
the loss ratio for the year ended june  increased slightly over the prior year as a result of the non renewal of the quota share reinsurance  which resulted in a higher percentage increase in losses and loss expenses incurred than the percentage increase in net premiums earned 
this occurred since policy and renewal fees included in net premiums earned were not ceded to the reinsurer and therefore remained the same relative to dollar amounts in both periods 
operating expenses insurance operating expenses increased to million for the year ended june  from million on a pro forma basis for the year ended june  this increase is primarily due to expenses  such as advertising  employee agent compensation  rent and premium taxes that vary along with the increase in net premiums earned and the addition of new retail locations 
the expense ratio increased from for the year ended june  on a proforma basis to for the year ended june  operating expenses incurred for new retail locations contributed to the increase in the expense ratio 
in addition  the expense ratio has also increased as a result of declining fee income from ancillary products which reduces expenses in calculating the expense ratio  and the fact that this fee income was spread over a larger base of net premiums earned as result of not renewing the quota share reinsurance 
the increase in the expense ratio for the year ended june   however  was tempered by the additional ceding commission of million 
overall  on a pro forma basis  the combined ratio increased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  in addition  during the year ended june   we recognized a million gain on the sale of property and equipment as a result of the sale of an aircraft previously used in the insurance operations 
actual results real estate and corporate loss before income taxes for the year ended june  was million versus loss before income taxes of million for the year ended june  for the year ended june   gains on sales of foreclosed real estate were million  compared with million for the year ended june  gains on sales of real estate represents proceeds received from the sale of foreclosed real estate in excess of carrying value  less selling costs 
investment income was million for the year ended june  compared with million for the year ended june  the decrease in available cash equivalents as a result of the usauto acquisition was offset by a higher return earned during the most recent fiscal year on our investment in mutual fund 
other operating expenses for fiscal primarily represent costs associated with being an operating public company  including the initial costs of implementing the sarbanes oxley act of  while other operating expenses for fiscal primarily represent the cost of former employees who were terminated as a result of the usauto acquisition 
pro forma results real estate and corporate on a pro forma basis  income before taxes for the year ended june  was million 
these results exclude compensation of terminated employees and reflect only the real estate operations and costs related to acquisition opportunities 
the results also reflect interest expense on usauto s note payable 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are premiums  commission and fee income and investment income 
our primary uses of funds are the payment of claims and operating expenses 
operating activities for the year ended june  provided million of cash  compared with million provided in the same period in fiscal net cash used by investing activities for the year ended june  was million  compared with million in the same period in fiscal both periods reflect additions to our investment portfolio as a result of the increase in net premiums earned and the fiscal amount also includes million paid for the chicago acquisition  net of tangible assets acquired 
during the year ended june   we increased the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries by million to support additional premium writings 
this capital contribution came from funds our holding company received from the insurance company subsidiaries through an intercompany tax allocation agreement under which the holding company was reimbursed for current tax benefits utilized through the recognition of tax net operating loss carryforwards 
at june   we had million available in unrestricted cash and investments outside of the insurance company subsidiaries 
we are part of an insurance holding company system with substantially all of our operations conducted by our insurance company subsidiaries 
accordingly  the holding company will only receive cash from operating activities as a result of investment income and the ultimate liquidation of our foreclosed real estate held for sale 
cash could be made available through loans from financial institutions  the sale of common stock  and dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries 
in addition  as a result of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  taxable income generated by the insurance company subsidiaries will provide cash to the holding company through an intercompany tax allocation agreement through which the insurance company subsidiaries reimburse the holding company for current tax benefits utilized through recognition of the net operating loss carryforwards 
state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries 
these limitations relate to statutory capital and surplus and net income 
in addition  the national association of insurance commissioners model act for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of statutory capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
a low rbc ratio would prevent an insurance company from paying dividends 
statutory guidelines suggest that the insurance company subsidiaries should not exceed a ratio of net premiums written to statutory capital and surplus of to we believe that the insurance company subsidiaries have sufficient financial resources available to support their net premium writings in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  when combined with anticipated cash flows generated from operations and dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries  will be adequate to meet our expected liquidity needs in both the short term and the reasonably foreseeable future 
our growth strategy includes possible acquisitions 
any acquisitions or other growth opportunities may require external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain external financing 
we cannot assure you that additional sources of financing will be available to us or that any such financing would not negatively impact our results of operations 
chicago acquisition in order to gain a presence in the market  on january   we acquired certain assets principally the trade names  customer lists and relationships and the lease rights to retail locations of two non standard automobile insurance agencies under common control in chicago  illinois for million in cash 
we also agreed to pay the agencies up to million in additional consideration if certain financial targets relating to the acquired business for the twelve months ending january  are reached 
as a result of this acquisition  we are now writing business through first acceptance insurance company  inc from these locations 
we did not acquire any policies in force as part of the transaction 
however  we receive a transaction service fee from the agencies as compensation for servicing the run off of the policies previously written by the agencies through other insurance companies 
the total amount payable to us under this contract is million  of which million was earned during the year ended june  the fee is being paid and earned in accordance with the estimated run off of the number of policies being serviced 
in connection with the acquisition  we concurrently entered into  and borrowed under  a credit agreement with two banks consisting of a million revolving facility and a million term loan facility  both maturing on 
table of contents june  both facilities bear interest at libor plus basis points per annum 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on january  that fixed the interest rate on the term loan facility at through june  the term loan facility is due in equal quarterly installments of million  plus interest  beginning april  and ending april   with a final payment of million due on june  during fiscal  we repaid million of indebtedness under the debt facilities  which included repayment of the full million borrowed under the revolving facility 
both facilities are secured by the common stock and certain assets of selected subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants regarding a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  a maximum net premiums written to surplus ratio  a maximum combined ratio and a minimum rbc 
at june   we were in compliance with all such covenants except for the net premiums written to surplus ratio for which a waiver has been obtained 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements or financing activities with special purpose entities  other than leases accounted for as operating leases in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of june  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands loss and loss adjustment expenses notes payable and capitalized lease obligation operating leases employment agreements severance agreement obligation advisory services agreement total contractual cash obligations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves do not have contractual maturity dates  however  based on historical payment patterns  the amount presented is our estimate of the expected timing of these payments 
the timing of these payments is subject to significant uncertainty 
we maintain a portfolio of marketable investments with varying maturities and a substantial amount of cash and cash equivalents intended to provide adequate cash flows for such payments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change  thus having an impact on the amounts reported in the future 
the following are considered to be our critical accounting policies valuation of deferred tax asset 
income taxes are maintained in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
valuation of the deferred tax asset is considered a critical accounting policy because the determination of our ability to utilize the asset involves a number of management assumptions relating to future operations that could materially affect the determination of the ultimate value and  therefore  the carrying amount of our deferred tax asset 
based on business activity prior to the usauto acquisition  management believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of the loss carryforwards 
therefore  a full valuation allowance had been established 
based upon our estimates of our future taxable income after the usauto acquisition  we reduced our deferred tax valuation allowance by million 
further  based upon our revised 
table of contents estimates after considering the actual results for the year ended june  and  the allowance was reduced by an additional million in and by an additional million in at june   our total gross deferred tax asset is million  and we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
on a net basis  the deferred tax asset is million after an allowance of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
if future taxable income is not sufficient to recover the deferred tax asset  the maximum charge to the provision for income taxes will be million 
if we generate sufficient future taxable income to fully utilize the deferred tax asset as of june   the maximum additional benefit for income taxes will be million 
losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves represent our best estimate of our ultimate liability for losses and lae relating to events that occurred prior to the end of any given accounting period  but have not been paid 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an automobile accident covered by one of our insurance policies  the reporting of the accident and the payment of the claim 
we record a liability for estimates of losses that will be paid for accidents that have been reported  which is referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported when they occur  we estimate liabilities for accidents that have occurred but have not been reported  which are referred to herein as incurred but not reported  or ibnr  reserves 
we are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expenses under the terms of the insurance policies that the insurance company subsidiaries underwrite 
each of the insurance company subsidiaries establishes a reserve for all of its unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  including case and ibnr reserves  and estimates for the cost to settle the claims 
we rely primarily on historical loss experience in determining reserve levels  on the assumption that historical loss experience provides a good indication of future loss experience 
we also consider various other factors  such as inflation  claims settlement patterns  legislative activity and litigation trends 
our internal actuarial staff continually monitors these estimates on a state and coverage level 
for the fiscal year ended june   we utilized our internal actuarial staff to determine appropriate reserve levels 
as experience develops or new information becomes known  we increase or decrease the level of our reserves in the period in which changes to the estimates are determined 
accordingly  the actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the estimates we have recorded 
see business loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for additional information 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the acquisition of usauto and the acquisition of automobile insurance agencies in texas and chicago resulted in goodwill of million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
these acquisitions also resulted in other identifiable intangible assets with a current book value of million 
as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
if impairment indicators exist between the annual testing periods  management will perform an interim impairment test 
should either an annual or interim impairment test determine that the fair value is below the carrying value  a write down of these assets will be required 
at june   impairment tests were performed and in management s opinion  no impairment exists
