item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the selected financial and other data and our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we were incorporated in maryland on april  and initially funded on june  we commenced material operations on october   when we completed our initial public offering the ipo of  common shares  raising net proceeds of million 
on march   we completed an add on offering of  shares of common stock  raising net proceeds of million 
on october   we completed an additional add on offering of  shares of common stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
our investment objectives are to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments 
we invest primarily in first and second lien senior loans and long term mezzanine debt  which in some cases may include an equity component  and  to a lesser extent  in equity investments in us private middle market companies 
we are an externally managed  non diversified  closed end investment company that is a bdc 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private us companies  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company  or a ric  under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a ric  we must  among other things  meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements 
pursuant to this election  we generally will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and include the accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiary 
the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications which  in the opinion of management  are necessary for the fair presentation of the results of the operations and financial condition for the periods presented 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
investments investment transactions are recorded on trade date 
realized gains or losses are computed using the specific identification method 
we carry our investments at fair value  as determined by our board of directors 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing of our investments include  as relevant  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our private equity valuation 
because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available  our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment 
preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management 
the audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations 
where appropriate  the committee may utilize an independent valuation firm selected by the board of directors 
the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser and audit committee and  where appropriate  an independent valuation firm 
as defined in the act  affiliate investments are those in which we own more than of the portfolio company s outstanding voting securities 
interest income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
the company stops accruing interest on its investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
if any cash is received after it is determined that interest is no longer collectible  we will treat the cash as payment on the principal balance until the entire principal balance has been repaid  before any interest income is recognized 
discounts and premiums on securities purchased are accreted amortized over the life of the respective security using the effective yield method 
the amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortizations of premium on bonds 
payment in kind interest the company has loans in its portfolio that contain a payment in kind pik provision 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain the company s status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends  even though the company has not yet collected the cash 
capital structuring service fees our investment adviser seeks to provide assistance to the portfolio companies in connection with the company s investments and in return we may receive fees for capital structuring services 
these fees are normally paid at the closing of the investments  are generally non recurring and are recognized as revenue when earned upon closing the investment 
the services that our investment adviser provides vary by investment  but generally consist of reviewing existing credit facilities  arranging bank financing  arranging equity financing  structuring financing from multiple lenders  structuring financing from equity investors  restructuring existing loans  raising equity and debt capital  and providing general financial advice  which concludes upon closing of the loan 
our investment adviser may also take a seat on the board of directors of a portfolio company  or observe the meetings of the board of directors without taking a formal seat 
any services of the above nature subsequent to the closing would generally generate a separate fee payable to the company 
in certain instances where the company is invited to participate as a co lender in a transaction and in the event that the company does not provide significant services in connection with the investment  a portion of loan fees paid to the company in such situations may be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
foreign currency translation the company s books and records are maintained in us dollars 
any foreign currency amounts are translated into us dollars on the following basis market value of investment securities  other assets and liabilities at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the day 
purchases and sales of investment securities  income and expenses at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions 
although the net assets and the fair values are presented at the foreign exchange rates at the end of the day  the company does not isolate the portion of the results of the operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair value of investments 
such fluctuations are included with the net realized and unrealized gains or losses from investments 
foreign security and currency translations may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in us companies and us government securities 
these risks include but are not limited to revaluation of currencies and future adverse political and economic developments which could cause investments in their markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable us companies 
federal income taxes the company has qualified and elected and intends to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to regulated investment companies under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of the code  as amended  and  among other things  has made and intends to continue to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders which will relieve the company from federal income taxes 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
in order to qualify as a ric  the company is required to timely distribute to its stockholders at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  for each year 
in accordance with statement of position  determination  disclosure  and financial statement presentation of income  capital gain  and return of capital distributions by investment companies  book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to capital in excess of par 
in addition  the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as highlighted in note to our consolidated financial statements 
dividends dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the record date 
the amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management 
net realized capital gains  if any  are generally distributed at least annually  although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our stockholders  unless a stockholder elects to receive cash 
as a result  if our board of directors authorizes  and we declare  a cash dividend  then our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  rather than receiving the cash dividends 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of actual and contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income or loss and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include the valuation of investments 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of the company s financial instruments approximate fair value 
the carrying value of interest and open trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses  as well as the credit facility payable approximate fair value due to their short maturity 
portfolio and investment activity on september   we entered into an agreement with royal bank of canada and its affiliates rbc whereby we agreed to pay  to rbc to acquire a right to purchase a portfolio of loans and equity investments comprising substantially of bdc qualifying assets the october portfolio that satisfy our investment objectives 
following the completion of our ipo on october   we exercised our right to purchase substantially all of the assets in the october portfolio from rbc for approximately million 
we purchased additional assets originally included in the october portfolio from rbc for approximately million on november  aside from the purchase of the october portfolio  the company also purchased a million of senior term debt  b million of senior subordinated debt  c million of senior notes  d million of investments in equity securities and e million of publicly traded fixed income securities during the period from october  the date of the ipo and commencement of substantial investment operations through december  in addition  we sold i million of senior term debt  ii million of senior subordinated debt  iii million of investments in equity securities and iv million of publicly traded fixed income securities during the period from october  the date of the ipo and commencement of substantial investment operations through december  also during the period  a million of senior term debt and b million of senior subordinated debt were redeemed 
for the year ended december   we issued new commitments in an aggregate amount of million million to new portfolio companies and million to existing portfolio companies 
during the year ended december   we funded million of such commitments million to new portfolio companies and million to existing portfolio companies 
we have remaining contractual obligations for million with respect to the million of commitments issued and not funded 
the weighted average yield of new income producing equity securities and debt funded in connection with such investments is approximately computed as a annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount earned on accruing debt  divided by b total income producing securities and debt at fair value 
for the year ended december   the company purchased a million aggregate principal amount of senior term debt  b million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated debt  c million of investments in equity securities  d million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and e million of investments in collateralized debt obligations 
during the same period  million aggregate principal amount of senior term debt and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated debt were redeemed 
additionally  a million aggregate principal amount of senior term debt  b million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and c million of investments in equity securities were sold 
as of december   the company held investments in portfolio companies 
we believe that as of december   the weighted average investment grade of the debt in our portfolio is and the weighted average yield of such income producing equity securities and debt is approximately computed as a annual stated interest rate or yield earned plus the net annual amortization of original issue discount and market discount earned on accruing debt  divided by b total income producing equity securities and debt at fair value 
as of december   we believe the weighted average investment grade of the debt in our portfolio was and the weighted average yield of such debt and income producing equity securities was approximately

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk as of december   approximately of the investments at fair value in our portfolio were at fixed rates while approximately were at variable rates 
in addition  the facilities are variable rate borrowing facilities 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates  we have performed the following analysis based on our december  balance sheet and assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure 
under this analysis  a basis point increase in the various base rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately  and an increase in interest expense of  over the next months 
a basis point decrease in the various base rates would result in a decrease in interest income of approximately  and a decrease in interest expense of  over the next months 
on january   we entered into a costless collar agreement in order to manage the exposure to changing interest rates related to the company s fixed rate investments 
the costless collar agreement was for a notional amount of million  has a cap of  a floor of and matures in the costless collar agreement allows us to receive an interest payment when the month libor exceeds and obligates us to pay an interest payment when the month libor is less than 
the costless collar resets quarterly based on the month libor 
as of december   the month libor was 
as of december   these derivatives had no fair value 
while hedging activities may mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates  certain hedging transactions that we may enter into in the future  such as interest rate swap agreements  may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments 
portfolio valuation we carry our investments at fair value  as determined by our board of directors 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market price is not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing of our investments include  as relevant  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparison to publicly traded securities and other relevant factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our private equity valuation 
because there is not a readily available market value for most of the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned
