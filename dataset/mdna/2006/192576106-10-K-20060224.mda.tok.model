item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business activity involves the development  manufacture  marketing  sale and servicing of test handling equipment for the global semiconductor industry 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
shifts in the semiconductor  electronics  computer and telecommunications industries  as well as rapidly shifting global economic conditions  have had and will have significant impacts on our businesses 
during the three year period ended december   the semiconductor equipment industry experienced a severe business downturn 
our net sales during this period declined more than from our record year in this decrease in revenue was generally comparable to most other companies in the semiconductor equipment industry  particularly the back end semiconductor equipment companies that would be considered the closest to cohu in terms of business cycles 
in the first six months of  our semiconductor equipment business  as well as the semiconductor equipment industry generally  saw significantly improved order bookings and backlog  an indication that the severe three year industry downturn had possibly ended 
additionally  our operating results improved during the period in part due to improved sales product mix resulting in a higher gross margin 
however  our orders declined in the second half of and business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry appeared to have weakened 
during the year ended december   our semiconductor equipment business saw a significant increase in order bookings that accounted for our order growth  from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of  and our sales in each of the four quarters of increased from the fourth quarter of our operating results also improved during in part due to continued favorable product mix with our advanced thermal systems accounting for a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment revenue 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  approximately million for the year ended december  and were primarily the result of decreases in customer forecasts  competitive conditions in the test handler industry and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix as a result of new product introductions 
exposures related to inventories are common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products and inventory and the shortened product life cycles caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
increased competition  particularly in the last several years  has also negatively impacted our gross margins on certain products and we believe it is likely these conditions will exist for the foreseeable future 
our other operating costs consist of research and development r d and selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
both r d and sg a expense increased in  due to increased business volume and investment in development programs 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses have comprised approximately of our revenues during the last three years 
during we saw improved results in our metal detection and microwave communications businesses 
the results of our television camera business deteriorated  primarily due to a decline in customer demand for our board level cameras 
our financial condition is strong with significant cash and short term investments and no long term debt 
during the three year period ended december  we generated million of net cash from operating activities and total cash and investments have increased from million at december  to million at december  our management team uses several performance metrics to manage our various businesses 
these metrics  which tend to focus on near term forecasts due to the limited order backlog in our businesses  include i order bookings and backlog for the most recently completed quarter and the forecast for the next quarter  ii inventory levels and 
table of contents related excess exposures typically based on the next twelve month s forecast  iii gross margin and other operating expense trends  and iv industry data and trends noted in various publicly released sources 
due to the short term nature of our order backlog that historically has represented about three months of business and the inherent volatility of the semiconductor equipment business  our past performance is frequently not indicative of future operating results or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  that are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred elements 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
our warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less or more favorable than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  increases to inventory reserves may be required 
income taxes we estimate our liability for income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations 
we must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any 
table of contents valuation allowance to be recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our gross deferred tax asset balance as of december  was million  with a valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance in the fourth quarters of and as a result of losses and to reflect uncertainties concerning our ability to generate future taxable income and our corresponding ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets consist primarily of deductible temporary differences  tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
intangible assets at december   intangible assets other than goodwill were evaluated for impairment using undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets as required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement no 
 and we concluded there was no impairment loss 
we are required to assess goodwill impairment using the methodology prescribed by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  statement no 

statement no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the required annual goodwill impairment test is performed as of october st of each year 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test in contingencies we are subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of our businesses 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  statement no 
we assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable  as defined in statement no 
and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  and we will adopt fsp during the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but we do not expect that it will have a material impact 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  statement no 

this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
statement no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in december   the fasb issued statement no 
revised share based payment  statement no

statement no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
statement no 
r will require that we expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
statement no 
r required certain companies to adopt the new accounting provisions beginning in however  on april   the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the compliance date of statement no 
r until the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins on or after june  as a result of the amendment  we will adopt statement no 
r using the modified prospective method on january  we are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of statement no 
r and the methodologies and assumptions we ultimately use may be different than those currently used 
we expect that our adoption of statement no 
r will result in an impact to our operating results that is similar to our current pro forma disclosures under statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  statement no 


table of contents in november   the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 statement no 
 which is the result of efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
statement no 
requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
statement no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt statement no 
on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of statement no 
 however  we do not believe it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the three year period ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative income loss from operations compared to net sales on february   our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year from december  to a week fiscal year ending on the last saturday of december 
our current fiscal year ended on december  and consisted of weeks 
our fiscal year ended december  also consisted of weeks 
our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in versus in sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and decreased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to the comparable period in the primary reason for the increase in sales of our semiconductor equipment business  during  was strong customer demand for our advanced thermal semiconductor test handlers and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for our general purpose test handlers 
during the net sales of our semiconductor equipment business benefited from the elimination of a million liability for customer sales credits that expired 
there were no sales credits eliminated during the decrease in sales experienced by our television camera business was primarily attributable to a decline in customer demand for our board level cameras partially offset by an increase in demand for our traffic and security cameras 
the increase in sales of our metal detection business was primarily attributable to sales of our portable metal detection equipment and increased demand for our industrial metal detection products 
during there was an increase in the sales by our microwave communications business 
the increase was primarily attributable to new product offerings  increased demand from law enforcement agencies and the result of the timing of revenue recognition pursuant to accounting rules 
at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily the result of additional revenue deferrals associated with delta s semiconductor equipment 

table of contents gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily as a result of lower margins in our semiconductor equipment business 
within the semiconductor equipment segment  margins decreased slightly in  primarily as a result of start up costs associated with the kryotech acquisition  selling price reductions on certain equipment  and increased overhead costs 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover our known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements  will result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 
in  we recorded a charge to cost of sales of approximately million as a result of inventory market valuation writedowns 
during  we sold certain of this inventory and our gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately million 
there were no sales of this inventory during research and development expense r d expense as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in r d was primarily the result of higher r d labor and material costs for product development in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communication businesses  offset by minor decreases in expenditures in our television camera and metal detection businesses 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in sg a expense was primarily related to increased business volume including increases in headcount  sales commissions  bad debt expense and incentive compensation 
interest income interest income was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in our average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and an increase in interest rates 
income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision benefit for income taxes in and  is lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to reductions in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  tax credits  export sales benefits and in the reversal of approximately million in accrued income taxes related to a tax examination completed in march in accordance with statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  statement no 
 net deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance of approximately million and million was provided on deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable was determined based on i taxable income in prior carry back years  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  iii tax planning strategies  and iv future taxable income  exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 

table of contents our business improved significantly in the second and third quarters of with orders increasing from million in the first quarter of to million and million in the second and third quarters  respectively 
this unanticipated increase in orders caused us to reassess our forecast of income that was used in evaluating the valuation allowance required at december  in accordance with statement no 
we reduced the valuation allowance required at june  and september   resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate in the second and third quarters of statement no 
requires that the effect of this reduction in the valuation allowance be recorded by adjusting the effective tax rate used to estimate the tax provision recorded in subsequent interim periods of during the second  third  and fourth quarters of and year ended december   the valuation allowance was reduced by approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million at december  is provided for state tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards that  in the opinion of management  are more likely than not to expire before we can use them 
we have derived significant tax benefits from export sales 
as a result of the american jobs creation act of  the export sales benefit derived from the extraterritorial income exclusion eti was repealed subject to a phase out that limits the full tax benefit to in and in the eti benefit was replaced with a deduction for domestic manufacturing activities subject to a phase in beginning in the future tax benefits we derive from the domestic manufacturing deduction will likely be less than those from eti 
other items in april  our broadcast microwave services subsidiary was awarded an million contract from the united arab emirates uae armed services to provide microwave communications equipment for a command center and infrastructure system for border security 
the contract  which utilizes our most advanced microwave communications technology that has not previously been installed in an application of this size and complexity  requires that of the total contract price be paid after the system has been fully accepted by the customer 
as a result of these factors and the inability to make reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion and acceptance  we will recognize all revenue and related costs under this contract in the period the system is accepted by the customer 
in the fourth quarter of  bms received notification that the customer had approved an amendment to the original contract increasing the total value of the contract to million 
under the terms of the amendment bms will provide certain additional equipment and services 
through december   we had shipped inventory with a sales value of million and deferred costs of approximately million resulting in deferred profit of approximately million under the contract 
in addition  at december  we had billed accounts receivable of approximately million and unbilled accounts receivable of approximately million 
we have also provided the customer with a standby letter of credit totaling approximately million at december   that may be drawn upon if bms does not fulfill the terms of the contract 
while customer acceptance and final contract payment has taken longer than anticipated  we believe that such acceptance and payment will be received 
however  in the event bms is unable to obtain customer acceptance of the system  the receivables may need to be written off and the customer might seek a refund of the million in payments made under the contract  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net income was million in  compared to net income of million in compared to net sales our net sales increased to million in  compared to net sales of million in sales of semiconductor test handling equipment in increased from the period and accounted for of consolidated net sales in  versus in the primary reason for the increase in sales of semiconductor equipment was an increase in customer demand for our products as the semiconductor industry 
table of contents experienced strong business conditions during the first six months of sales of television cameras and other equipment accounted for of net sales in and increased when compared to  while the combined sales of metal detection and microwave equipment increased from the increase in demand for our other  non semiconductor equipment products can be attributed to increased sales of our products to the us government and greater demand for security related products during at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
at december   we had deferred revenue totaling approximately million and deferred profit of million 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily the result of additional revenue deferrals associated with bms contract with the united arab emirates and delta s semiconductor equipment 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in during our gross margin was favorably impacted by improved product mix  increased business volume and manufacturing efficiencies 
our gross margin was also favorably impacted by million from the sale of inventory which had previously been written down and the elimination of million in accrued sales credits 
in both and  our gross margin was negatively impacted by charges to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventory 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of declines in customer forecasts for certain products  lower of cost or market inventory writedowns and other business issues that negatively impacted our forecasted inventory usage 
research and development expense r d as a percentage of net sales was in  compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in  to million in the increase in r d was primarily the result of increased r d material and labor costs for product development in our semiconductor equipment and television camera businesses 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in the increase in sg a was due to  among other things  increased business volume  higher incentive compensation expenses and additional compliance costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act of interest income interest income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates in income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pretax income loss was in and in the provision benefit for income taxes differs from the u 
s federal statutory rate primarily due to tax credits  export sales benefits  changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and settlement of prior period tax returns and adjustments to prior year tax accruals 
other items on april   we announced that our delta design subsidiary was relocating its littleton  massachusetts operation to its facility in poway  california 
we recorded charges to operations in the years ended december  and totaling approximately million and million  respectively  for severance and other related exit costs 
in december   we invested million in kryotech  inc preferred stock 
in june   we wrote off the investment and recorded a million charge as the investment was deemed impaired and such impairment was considered other than temporary  under the guidelines of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  apb no 


table of contents in april   our delta design subsidiary completed the relocation of its columbus  ohio operations to its facility in poway  california 
we recorded charges to operations in the year ended december   totaling million for severance and one time termination benefits and other related exit costs 
this relocation was completed in and we did not record any additional charges during on april   we sold twelve acres of land in poway  california held for future development for million in net cash proceeds resulting in a pretax gain of approximately million 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net income was million in compared to a net loss of  in liquidity and capital resources our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources is cash flow generated by our operations 
while we maintain a credit facility  we have not used this as a source of cash 
we use cash to fund growth in our operating assets  including accounts receivable and inventory  and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development 
liquidity working capital the following summarizes our cash  cash equivalents  investments and working capital december  december  percentage in thousands increase change cash  cash equivalents and investments working capital cash flows operating activities our net cash provided from operating activities in totaled million 
the major components of cash flows provided by operating activities  net of the effects of the kryotech acquisition  were net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million  offset by the net change in current assets and liabilities 
the net change in current assets and liabilities included an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily attributable to the increased sales during day s sales outstanding at december   calculated based on revenue for the most recent quarter and accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date  was days 
purchases of inventory were primarily made to support increased customer demand for products in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communication businesses 
investing activities our net cash used for investing activities in totaled million and was primarily the result of million cash used for purchases of short term investments  partially offset by million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments 
our cash expenditures for capital and intangible assets  in fiscal were million and included the purchase of kryotech assets for million  the acquisition of other intangible assets for million and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the acquisition of kryotech and other intangible assets were strategic transactions to strengthen the portfolio of intellectual property  patents and know how within our semiconductor equipment business 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment were primarily made to support activities in our semiconductor equipment business and consisted primarily of software and equipment used in engineering  manufacturing and related functions 

table of contents financing activities our net cash provided from financing activities in totaled million and included million received from the issuance of common stock relating to our employee equity plans  offset by million for the payment of dividends 
capital resources in june  we renewed our million unsecured bank line of credit bearing interest at the bank s prime rate 
the line of credit will expire in july   and requires that we maintain specified minimum levels of net worth  limits the amount of our capital expenditures and requires us to meet certain other financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with these covenants 
no borrowings were outstanding at december   however  million of the credit facility was allocated to standby letters of credit at december   leaving the balance of million available for future borrowings 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital and available borrowings under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  fiscal year total in thousands non cancelable operating leases purchase commitments from time to time  we enter into commitments with our vendors to purchase inventory at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
no liability has been recorded in connection with these arrangements beyond those required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we do not believe it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio included short term  fixed income investment securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates eg to would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars and as a result we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are not significant 
the effect of an immediate ten percent change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
