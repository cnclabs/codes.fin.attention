the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization and development of unique and uniquely improved products for serious conditions of the eye 
we currently have three products available for sale in the united states i istalol for the treatment of glaucoma  ii vitrase for use as a spreading agent  and iii xibrom for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following cataract surgery 
we also have several product candidates in various stages of development 
we have incurred losses since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million through december  results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations generally reflects our transition from a development stage company to a commercial stage company with a primary focus on ophthalmology 
years ended december   and revenue 
revenue was approximately million in  as compared to million in and  in the increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to the launch of vitrase and xibrom in the first and second quarters of  respectively 
the increase in revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to the launch of istalol in the third quarter of of our total revenue for  million was derived from sales of our products  which included xibrom s initial stocking order 
net product sales for were million  which was istalol s initial stocking order 
there were no product sales during in addition to product revenues in and  we recorded license revenue of  in  and  which reflects the amortization for the period of deferred revenue recorded in december for the license fee payment made by otsuka pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in connection with the license of vitrase in japan for ophthalmic uses in the posterior region of the eye 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million in as compared to million in there were no product sales during cost of products sold for consisted primarily of standard costs for each of our commercial products  distribution costs  royalties  inventory reserves for short dating of certain istalol lots and other costs of products sold 
the increase in cost of products sold in from was primarily the result of increased net product sales after the launch of our new products in product gross margin for the twelve month period ended december  was million  or of net product sales  as compared to  or of net product sales  for the twelve month period ended december  which included net product sales only from the launch of our first commercial product  istalol  in the third quarter of the percentage increase in product gross margin for the twelve month period ended december  
table of contents as compared to the prior period is primarily due to changes in our product mix resulting from launching two new products in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in our research and development expenses to date have consisted primarily of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs for consultants and contract research organizations and costs related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities for vitrase  istalol and xibrom 
research and development expenses for included million in milestone payments under various licensing agreements 
we generally classify and separate research and development expenditures into amounts related to clinical development costs  regulatory costs  pharmaceutical development costs  manufacturing development costs and medical affairs costs 
in  approximately of our research and development expenditures were for clinical development costs  was spent on regulatory costs  was spent on pharmaceutical development costs  was spent on manufacturing development costs and approximately was spent on medical affairs costs 
changes in our research and development expenses are primarily due to the following clinical development costs overall clinical costs  which include clinical investigator fees  study monitoring costs and data management  for increased by  from the increase in clinical costs in was primarily due to the commencement and completion of enrollment during the second half of of the tobra pred product phase iii clinical study and the ecabet sodium phase iib clinical study 
regulatory costs regulatory costs for increased by  from the increase is primarily attributable to the emea filing fees for vitragan in europe 
pharmaceutical development costs research costs for decreased by  from the decrease is primarily due to the loss recorded on the transfer of assets to our raw material third party manufacturer during manufacturing development costs contract manufacturing costs for increased by  from the increase is primarily attributable to the scale up of activities associated with the increase in the number of commercial products during as compared to and the continued improvement of our product pipeline 
medical affairs costs medical affairs costs for increased by million from the increase is due to the scale up of the department  increasing the headcount of the department and the related activities of the department 
medical affairs department was created during to provide additional expertise to the company 
the costs in primarily relate to personnel costs 
our research and development activities reflect our efforts to advance our product candidates through the various stages of product development 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our development plans are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may affect our research and development expenditures and capital resources 
for instance  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly depending on a variety of factors including a trial s protocol  the number of patients in the trial  the duration of patient follow up  the number of clinical sites in the trial  and the length of time required enrolling suitable patient subjects 
even if earlier results are positive  we may obtain different results in later stages of development  including failure to show the desired safety or efficacy  which could impact our development expenditures for a particular product candidate 
although we spend a considerable amount of time planning our development activities  we may be required to alter from our plan based on new circumstances or events or our assessment from time to time of a product candidate s market potential  other product opportunities and our corporate priorities 
any deviation from our plan may require us to incur additional expenditures or accelerate or delay the timing of our development spending 
furthermore  as we obtain results from trials and review the path toward regulatory approval  we may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates in certain indications  in order to focus our resources on more promising candidates or indications 
depending upon the progress of our clinical and pre clinical programs we expect our research and development expenses in to be approximately higher than the same prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to an increase of million in sales and marketing expenses associated with the commercial launch of our approved products including an increase in sales personnel from to representatives 
table of contents as of december  offset by a decrease of million in general corporate expenses 
the decrease of million in general corporate expenses is the result of a  increase in general corporate expense in principally related to facility and personnel costs  offset by a one time payment during the third quarter of of million which was recorded upon entering an agreement with allergan pursuant to which we reacquired all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to i increases in selling and marketing expenses of million to support the commercial launch of our approved products  ii increases in general and administrative expenses of million due to increased administrative costs related to expanding our commercial operations and other general corporate expenses principally related to accounting and auditing fees associated with the sarbanes oxley act of  and iii one time payment of million to allergan  inc in connection with our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses in to be approximately higher than the same prior year period 
stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees and directors is the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date the options were granted 
deferred compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years

for the year ended december   we granted stock options to employees to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the time of grant 
in previous years  we granted stock options to employees with a grant price less than the fair market value at the date of grant 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded amortization of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was million in   in and  in the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to higher cash balances as a result of our receipt of million of net proceeds from our january financing and other stock issuances and higher rates of return as compared to the increase in interest income in is attributable to higher average cash balances on hand as compared to  primarily as a result of our receipt of million of net proceeds in connection with our november equity financing and million of net proceeds in connection with our august equity financings 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately  in   in and  in interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest accrued on the million liability due and fully paid during the first quarter of to allergan as a result of our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase in the united states and other specified markets 
interest expense incurred during was also primarily attributable to the interest accrued on the million liability due to allergan  which was entered into during the fourth quarter of the interest expense incurred during was primarily attributable to the interest paid on the financing of our directors and officers insurance premiums 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of 
table of contents approximately million and million  respectively  which we have fully reserved due to the uncertainty of realization 
our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
we also have federal and california research tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research tax credits will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our california research tax credit carryforwards do not expire and will carryforward indefinitely until utilized 
in addition  we have california manufacturer s investment credit of approximately  that will begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
during  a change in ownership  as described in the internal revenue code section  did occur and will limit our ability to utilize the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in the future 
investments 
we review investments in corporate bonds and government agency securities for other than temporary impairment whenever the fair value of an investment is less than amortized cost and evidence indicates that an investment s carrying amount is not recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
investments in an unrealized loss position for greater than a year were comprised of corporate bonds and us government agency securities 
the unrealized losses were due to fluctuations in interest rates 
to determine whether impairment is other than temporary  we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable and outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  compliance with our investment policy  the severity and the duration of the impairment and changes in value subsequent to year end 
we have reviewed those securities with unrealized losses as of december  and and have concluded that no other than temporary impairment existed as of december  and liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our debt and equity securities 
since march  we have received gross proceeds of approximately million from sales of our common stock and the issuance of promissory notes 
in addition  we received million from a licensing arrangement entered into in in december  we entered into a revolving credit facility  whereby we may borrow up to million 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under the credit facility 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate or  at our option  libor plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and maximum losses during any calendar quarter and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility 
all amounts owing under the credit facility will become due and payable on january  during  we used million of cash for operations primarily as a result of the net loss of million and a change in working capital of million  which primarily includes a million payment including interest incurred as a result our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase in the united states and other specified markets from allergan  and a combined increase in accounts receivable  net  and inventory  net  of million 
during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of  the transfer of equipment for technology of  and the change in other liabilities of million  relative to the million liability incurred in connection with our reacquisition of all rights to market and sell vitrase for all uses in the united states and other specified markets million was paid prior to december  
during  we used million of cash for operations principally as a result of the net loss of million partially offset by non cash compensation expense of  net cash used in investing activities totaled million during compared to million of cash provided by investing activities during during  million of cash was used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for is primarily attributable to the purchase of our short term investment securities 
cash provided for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in two registered direct offerings in august at an aggregate purchase price of million before offering expenses and fees  which was subsequently invested in short term investments 
cash used for investing activities in is primarily attributable to the follow on public offering of  shares of common stock in november at an aggregate purchase price of million before offering expenses  fees and discounts  which was subsequently invested in short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during compared to million in and million in the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily the result of the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock under our universal shelf registration statement in an underwritten public offering for an aggregate purchase price of million  before offering expenses and underwriting discounts 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net cash from the sale of an aggregate of  shares of common stock in two registered direct offerings in august at an aggregate purchase price of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities in is primarily attributable to million net proceeds from the public sale of  shares of common stock in november we believe that our existing cash balances  together with amounts available for borrowing under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the end of however  our actual future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of the commercialization of our products  
table of contents sales and marketing activities  and expansion of our commercial infrastructure  related to our approved products and product candidates  the results of our clinical trials and requirements to conduct additional clinical trials  the rate of progress of our research and development programs  the time and expense necessary to obtain regulatory approvals  activities and payments in connection with potential acquisitions of companies  products or technology  competitive  technological  market and other developments  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative relationships  and opportunities for the acquisition of late stage or currently marketed complementary product candidates 
these factors may cause us to seek to raise additional funds through additional sales of our debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or  if available  will be on terms favorable to us or to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations obligation under capital leases long term liability obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
included within these policies are our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 

table of contents we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
revenue recognition product revenue 
we recognize revenue from product sales  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we recognize product revenue net of estimated allowances for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks 
if actual future payments for allowances for discounts  returns  rebates and chargebacks exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
in general  we are obligated to accept from our customers the return of pharmaceuticals that have reached their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established reserves for such amounts at the time of sale 
with the launch of each of our products  we recorded a sales return allowance  which was larger for stocking orders than subsequent re orders 
to date  actual product returns have not exceeded our estimated allowances for returns 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowances for returns 
license revenue 
we recognize revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
amounts received for product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  unless the amounts received are creditable against royalties or we have ongoing performance obligations 
royalty revenue will be recognized upon sale of the related products  provided the royalty amounts are fixed and determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
inventories inventory consists of currently marketed products 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at standard cost 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
if a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
inventories  net of allowances  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first to expire method 
income taxes we record a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
new accounting pronouncement in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r revised  share based payment 
the revisions to sfas no 
require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be re measured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
sfas no

and supersedes apb opinion no 
for public entities  the provisions of the statement are effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after december  we will adopt the provisions of the new statement in the first fiscal quarter of although we will continue to evaluate the application of sfas no

 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by a new accounting standard when the standard does not include specific transition provisions 
previous guidance required most voluntary change in accounting principle to be recognized by including in net income of the period in which the change was made the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
carries forward existing guidance regarding the reporting of the correction of an error and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of sfas no 
as of january  is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
seeking to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair market value of our interest sensitive financial investments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our investment income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
all outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate or  at our option  libor plus  which is payable on a monthly basis and which may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
we estimate that a change in interest rates on our credit facility would not have had a material effect on our net loss for we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
