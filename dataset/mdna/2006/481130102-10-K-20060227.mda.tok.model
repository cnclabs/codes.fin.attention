the year was a year in which we did not achieve our financial plan 
we had expected a challenging year in without the million in political and issue and olympics television advertising we sold in we had also anticipated a reduction in our telecommunications wholesale revenue as our customers clarified their needs in the services we provide  reduced their spending and negotiated new market rate contracts with us 
our challenge was heightened as the nbc television network ratings fell  negatively affecting three of our stations 
hurricane katrina and the printing facility shutdown in new orleans disrupted ongoing margin improvement at our community newspapers and shoppers business 
advertising revenue softened  especially in the automotive category  during the second half of the year  and the enterprise business at norlight faced a very competitive environment 
we continue to see growth at journal interactive where revenues increased to over million in in december  we added three television stations to our broadcasting business 
we have had a strong start at the new stations  where a managed integration effort has helped us achieve early results that were beyond our expectations 
at our radio operations  we saw improvement in earnings and margin for the fifth consecutive year 
and at our printing services business  we made progress toward our transition back to our core printing business while improving operating results 
acquisitions on december   we acquired the business and assets of fox affiliate wftx tv  in fort myers naples  florida and abc affiliate  kgun tv  in tucson  arizona 
we also acquired certain assets of cbs affiliate kmtv tv  in omaha  nebraska and have begun programming kmtv tv under a local marketing agreement

these decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue from our and television acquisitions  classified advertising revenue at our publishing businesses  local advertising revenue at our radio stations  other revenue at our daily newspaper and postage amounts billed to customers at our direct marketing business 
the increase in total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations is due to the addition of the green bay  wisconsin  omaha  nebraska  tucson  arizona and naples fort myers  florida television operations and our acquired telecommunications business  an increase in newsprint and other paper expense at our publishing businesses  an increase in postage and freight expense associated with mailing services revenue at our direct marketing business  and higher operating costs associated with a higher mix of lower margin enterprise services revenue at our telecommunications business 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in operating costs and expenses at our printing services business due to improved production efficiencies and in syndicated and network programming costs at our television stations 
the increase in selling and administrative expenses from continuing operations is primarily due to the addition of the green bay  wisconsin  omaha  nebraska  tucson  arizona and naples fort myers  florida television operations  hurricane katrina and printing facility closure costs at our community newspapers and shoppers business 
these increases were partially offset by cost saving initiatives at our printing services business  a decrease in payroll related termination benefits and incentive compensation expense at our daily newspaper  decrease in incentive compensation and bonuses  decrease in overall cost reduction initiatives at our publishing businesses  and reductions in a reserve for bad debts at our television operations

these decreases were partially offset by improved production efficiencies at our printing services business  an increase in revenue at our radio stations and a gain on the sale of radio station khlp am in omaha 
our consolidated ebitda in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in we define ebitda as net earnings excluding gain loss from discontinued operations  net  provision for income taxes  total other expense  net  depreciation and amortization 
we believe the presentation of ebitda is relevant and useful because it helps improve our investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
our management uses ebitda  among other things  to evaluate our operating performance  to value prospective acquisitions and as a component of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel 
in addition  our lenders use ebitda as one of the measures of our ability to service our debt 
ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to ebitda measures reported by other companies 
in addition  ebitda does not represent funds available for discretionary use 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net earnings to consolidated ebitda for and dollars in millions net earnings gain from discontinued operations  net provision for income taxes total other expense  net depreciation amortization ebitda the decrease in ebitda is consistent with decreases in operating earnings in our telecommunications  broadcasting and publishing segments  partially offset by an increase in operating earnings at our printing services and other segments

we are now recording circulation revenue on a retail gross  rather than a wholesale net  basis as do many newspapers 
the impact is an increase in revenue offset by a like amount in increased operating expense 
this reclassification has no impact on earnings 
in and  the impact to circulation revenue was million and million  respectively 
the table below also reflects a reclassification of revenue categories for the daily newspaper

the advertising classification previously labeled general is now called national 
further  any advertising that runs in the classified section of our daily newspaper s various products including online  mke and specialty publications is now included in the pertinent classified verticals of employment  auto  real estate and other

this decrease is consistent with the national trend

on october   we acquired the business and certain assets of nbc affiliate wgba tv  in green bay  wisconsin and certain assets of upn affiliate wacy tv  which is licensed to serve appleton  wisconsin 
we also assumed an existing local marketing agreement between wgba tv and wacy tv 
the aggregate purchase price for these stations was million 
this acquisition contributed million in revenue and million in operating earnings in telecommunications revenue from telecommunications in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in operating earnings from telecommunications in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in wholesale telecommunication services provide network transmission solutions for other service providers by offering bulk transmission capacity 
revenue from wholesale services in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to service disconnections and lower pricing on customer contract renewals 
while we are not always able to determine the specific reason a customer may disconnect service  we believe the trend of customers focusing on reducing their network costs by consolidating traffic on least cost routes will continue 
monthly recurring revenue from wholesale services at the end of was million compared to million at the beginning of and million at the beginning of during  new circuit connections of million in monthly recurring revenue were more than offset by service disconnections and repricings 
we have substantial business relationships with a few large customers  including major long distance carriers 
our top customers accounted for and of our telecommunications revenue in and  respectively 
during  we signed a three year master capacity agreement with global crossing to provide carrier services throughout the great lakes region 
this agreement resulted in service disconnections and reduced pricing from those that had previously been in effect and a number of circuit service orders were renewed and re priced 
in february  we signed a new five year contract extension with mci whereby they remain a significant customer 
the new contract includes reduced prices for current services being provided to mci and provisions for higher capacity circuits to replace specific existing circuits being disconnected 
the effect of the pricing provisions will occur at various times throughout we believe they will remain a significant customer  though we can not predict the outcome of a potential sale or merger of mci 
when the terms of the agreements with global crossing and mci are in full effect  it is expected that neither customer will individually account for more than of our telecommunications revenue

table of contents telecommunication services is adversely impacting us through the loss of existing customers or by reducing the success rate of securing new customers 
we have been proactively working with our customers by leveraging our customer service abilities and adding new bundled services as we extend contracts at reduced prices 
in december  we acquired the customer base and certain assets of executone of western michigan  inc d b a netcom group  a provider of networking  business telephone system and carrier services solutions in grand rapids  mi 
the cash purchase price was million 
the decrease in operating earnings from telecommunications was primarily due to the decrease in wholesale revenue  higher operating costs and expenses associated with the higher mix of enterprise revenue  and gains on the sales of towers in partially offsetting these earnings decreases were decreases in selling and promotional expenses  bad debt expense  and a lease abandonment charge in we do not believe we have a material bad debt exposure because we bill all data services for both wholesale and enterprise customers in advance of providing services 
most customers are required to pay their bill before services are provided 
printing services revenue from printing services in was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in operating loss from printing services in was million  a decrease of million  compared to operating earnings of million in the decrease in printing services revenue was primarily attributed to decreases in revenue from our largest customer  dell computer corporation  and from other computer related customers 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in publication printing revenue primarily from newly acquired business 
dell computer corporation accounted for and of our printing services revenue in and  respectively 
in  dell decided to eliminate supplying its customers with certain items that we produce and  as a result  our revenue from dell declined by million 
we anticipate our revenue from dell will further decline in this changing relationship with dell represents an important step in our long term strategy to minimize our reliance on a single customer in our printing services segment and to return to our core printing business 
the decrease in printing services operating earnings was primarily attributed to the decrease in sales volume  production inefficiencies on print work  charges for workforce reductions  and a charge for some of the costs incurred for a discontinued software system implementation project 
these earnings decreases were partially offset by lower production costs due to the decrease in sales volume and cost reduction initiatives

table of contents on december   we amended our million unsecured revolving credit facility 
our amended million unsecured revolving facility expires on june  as of december   we had borrowings outstanding of million under the facility 
other long term liabilities consist primarily of obligations for non compete agreements resulting from acquisitions and deposits received from subleases of building operating leases 
we lease office space  certain broadcasting facilities  distribution centers  printing plants and equipment under both short term and long term leases accounted for as operating leases 
some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses  as well as provisions for the payment of utilities  maintenance and taxes by us 
purchase commitments for newsprint for our publishing businesses from two newsprint suppliers  which run through and  were million as of december  the commitment is based on market prices for quantities we determine will meet our newsprint requirements over the term of the contract  but we have no obligation to purchase any particular quantities 
in the unlikely event that newsprint is no longer required in our business  our commitment would expire without obligation 
purchase commitments related to broadcasting equipment and systems were approximately million as of december  in addition  we have the right to broadcast certain television programs during the years under contracts aggregating million 
we have million of standby letters of credit for business insurance purposes 
we do not engage in off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenues or expenses 
we do not rely on off balance sheet arrangements for liquidity  capital resources  market risk support  credit risk support or other benefits 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related footnote disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  property and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  litigation  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we specifically review historical write off activity by market  large customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due us to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history  the length of time the receivables are past due and the current business environment 
if our evaluations of the collectibility of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  increases or decreases in bad debt expense and allowances may be required 

table of contents property and equipment and definite lived intangibles we assign useful lives for our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles based on our estimate of the amount of time that we will use those assets and we have selected the straight line method to depreciate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles 
a change in the estimated useful lives or the depreciation or amortization method used could have a material impact upon our results of operations 
we evaluate our property and equipment and definite lived intangibles for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that  if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from an asset or group of assets  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated future cash flows related to an asset or group of assets is highly susceptible to change because we must make assumptions about future revenue and the related cost of sales 
changes in our assumptions could require us to recognize a loss for asset impairment 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and broadcast licenses account for and of total assets in and  respectively 
the annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses under statement no 
require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by factors including competitive industry valuations and long term interest rates that exist at the time the annual impairment tests are performed 
accordingly  we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement no 
to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively 
accrued income taxes the internal revenue service irs and various state departments of revenue routinely examine our federal and state tax returns 
from time to time  the irs and the state departments of revenue may challenge certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law  and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs or state departments of revenue could require us to make additional tax payments or have an impact on our effective tax rate 
nonetheless  we believe that we have adequately reserved for any foreseeable payments related to such matters and consequently do not anticipate any material earnings impact from the ultimate resolution of such matters 
as of december  and december   we recorded liabilities to cover additional tax exposure items of million and million  respectively 
accrued litigation we are subject to various legal actions  administrative proceedings and claims 
when necessary  we may need to record a liability for an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of such claims 
the estimate would be developed in consultation with counsel and would be based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we believe that such unresolved legal actions and claims would not materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
employee benefits we are self insured for a majority of our employee related health and disability benefits and workers compensation claims 
third party administrators are used to process all claims 
liabilities for unpaid claims are based on our historical claims experience 
liabilities for workers compensation claims are developed from actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could vary significantly from such estimates which would require us to record additional expense in the future 

table of contents we rely upon actuarial valuations to determine pension costs and funding 
we provide the actuarial firms with certain assumptions that have a significant effect on our obligations  such as the discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligations and expense  the return on assets used to estimate the growth in invested asset value available to satisfy certain obligations  the salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on pension obligations  and the employee turnover statistics used to estimate the number of employees to be paid pension benefits 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for and are pension benefits other postretirement benefits discount rate for expense discount rate for obligations rate of compensation increases for expense rate of compensation increases for obligations expected return on plan assets for our pension plans  a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have lowered by million or raised by million  respectively  the plans expense and would have lowered the plans projected benefit obligations by million or raised by million  respectively  as of december  to determine the discount rate assumptions for the pension and the postretirement benefit plans  we studied our plans specific discount rate by matching our projected benefit payments to a yield curve developed from high grade corporate bonds 
the results of those studies were used as the benchmark to determine the discount rate assumptions 
in addition  we used the moody s aa corporate bonds  as of the measurement dates  as another reference point to support our decision 
to determine the long term rate of return assumption for pension plan assets  we study historical markets and preserve the long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income securities consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
we evaluate current market factors such as inflation and interest rates before we determine long term capital market assumptions 
we review peer data and historical returns to check for reasonability and appropriateness 
we make other assumptions that affect the accounting for pension benefits  such as the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions affect the benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the pension plan and the other postretirement plan and the required funding of the pension plan 
we review these assumptions on an annual basis 
we also rely upon actuarial valuations to determine postretirement benefit costs other than pension 
we provide our actuarial firm with the assumption of the discount rate and medical cost inflation 
these assumptions could have a significant effect on our obligation 
the discount rate is used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation 
the health care cost trend rate is used to calculate the impact future medical costs would have on postretirement obligations

effect of inflation our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation 
we have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity  cost containment programs and  where the competitive environment permits  increased selling prices 
however  changes in newsprint prices could have an impact on costs  which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks  which are borrowings under our million unsecured revolving credit facility  and in prices for newsprint 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
interest rates on our long term notes payable to banks are variable 
the interest rate on our current unsecured revolving credit facility is either at libor plus a margin that ranges from basis points to basis points  depending on our leverage  or the base rate  which equals the higher of the prime rate set by us bank  us or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
average interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility were in if interest rates had been basis points higher  our annual interest expense would have increased million  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
we currently purchase approximately of our estimated newsprint requirements from two suppliers 
we pay market prices for quantities we determine will meet our requirements 
the remaining of our newsprint could come from these suppliers or from other suppliers in the spot market 
price fluctuations for newsprint can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the average net price per ton was in based on the average net price per ton in and consumption of newsprint in  a per ton increase or decrease in the price of newsprint would increase or decrease our total cost of newsprint by million 
we have not entered into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to newsprint price risk
