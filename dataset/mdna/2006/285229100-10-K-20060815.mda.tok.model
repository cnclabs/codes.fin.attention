business overview electro scientific industries  inc and its subsidiaries esi provide high technology manufacturing systems to the global electronics market  including advanced laser based systems that are used to microengineer semiconductor device features in high volume production environments 
our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors  passive electronic components and electronic interconnect devices 
our equipment enables these manufacturers to achieve yield and productivity gains in their manufacturing processes that can be critical to their profitability 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end products in the computer  consumer electronics  communications and automotive industries 
esi was founded in and is headquartered in portland  oregon 
we believe we are the leading supplier of advanced laser microengineering systems that allow electronics manufacturers to physically alter select device features during high volume production in order to heighten performance and boost production yields of semiconductor devices  advanced semiconductor packaging  flex circuits and passive electronic components and circuitry 
laser microengineering comprises a set of precise fine tuning processes laser trimming  link cutting and via drilling that require application specific laser systems able to meet semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturers exacting performance and productivity requirements 
additionally  we produce high speed test and termination equipment used in the high volume production of multi layer ceramic capacitors mlccs and other passive components  as well as passive component inspection systems 
electronics industry overview the electronic content of everyday items such as computers  communication devices  consumer products and automobiles continues to increase 
for example  markets for consumer oriented electronic products such as 
table of contents wireless telephones  computers  personal digital assistants pdas  digital audio players  digital video recorders  digital cameras and home entertainment devices have developed rapidly as increasingly affordable products have been introduced that are smaller  lighter and more portable 
in addition  automobile manufacturers now routinely include electronic ignition and fuel injection  anti lock brakes  navigation systems and other electronic safety and sensor systems in place of components that in the past were predominantly mechanical or hydraulic 
the increasing demand for electronic products has been accompanied by the need for faster  smaller  more complex  less expensive and higher quality electronic devices and circuits 
to achieve these performance and size improvements  electronic device manufacturers are increasing the circuit densities in these devices and tuning them to precise electrical values 
manufacturers of cellular telephones  for example  must use miniaturized circuits to accommodate the size limitations of their finished products 
these circuits must also be tuned to operate within precise frequency specifications  enabling the existing wireless frequency bands to accommodate more users without interchannel interference 
smaller and lighter requirements also decrease the physical dimensions used in electronic interconnections within the electronic device  its surrounding package and the high density interconnect hdi circuit board on which it is mounted 
higher operating speeds of computers and communications products also require more input and output channels within these packages and between the packages and the hdi circuit board 
the highly competitive consumer markets for electronic products drive the demand for lower cost devices and components 
electronic devices and components are produced in large unit volumes  and their production and testing is highly automated  utilizing a variety of manufacturing equipment 
manufacturers continually seek to reduce costs by improving the throughput  yield and quality of device and component production 
these manufacturers are also developing new materials to improve performance and reduce costs of their devices 
this challenges equipment suppliers to innovate new manufacturing process solutions and equipment 
for example  semiconductor device manufacturers are continuing the transition from mm and smaller silicon wafers to mm wafers  which can accommodate a significantly higher number of electronic devices 
in addition  increasing circuit densities enable more devices to be produced on a silicon wafer by reducing the size of each device on the wafer 
together  larger wafers and smaller device designs significantly reduce the cost of semiconductor devices 
increasing circuit densities which result from shrinking line widths and faster operating speeds require the use of materials such as copper to create these miniaturized and higher performance electronic circuits 
to improve production yield  or the number of acceptable devices produced per silicon wafer  device manufacturers are utilizing advanced systems  such as our laser memory repair products  to boost final yields in the manufacture of devices 
this includes dynamic random access memory dram  nand flash memory and non memory devices  such as logic with embedded memory and high end electronic game chips 
as semiconductor manufacturers move toward higher densities and more complex architectures  machine vision has also emerged as a critical technology 
machine vision is an enabling technology in the semiconductor manufacturing process that allows manufacturers to achieve increased equipment speed with fewer errors 
moreover  machine vision technology is proving to be integral to applications such as wafer identification 
as the increased functionality of next generation chips continues to drive up total wafer cost  the need to accurately track and identify wafers will become even more critical to chip manufacturers bottom lines 
variations of these advanced technologies and manufacturing processes that are routinely used in semiconductor fabs are increasingly being employed in the production of passive components  hdi circuit boards and advanced semiconductor packages 
an example is the use of machine vision in passive component inspection 
as device sizes grow ever smaller and critical dimensions of the electrical contacts become more precise  machine vision  incorporated with high speed handling and real time software  allows for inspection of mlccs at over  parts per hour 
the previous technique utilized human inspection at a much slower rate with poorer inspection results

competition our markets are dynamic  cyclical and highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance  ease of use  cost of ownership  reliability  service  technical support  a product improvement path  price  established relationships with customers  product familiarity and proprietary technology 
we believe that our products compete favorably with respect to these factors 
some of our competitors have greater financial  engineering and manufacturing resources and larger distribution networks than we do 
some of our customers develop  or have the ability to develop  manufacturing equipment similar to our products 
competition in our markets may intensify and our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by competitors or customers or changes in electronic device processing technology 
the principal competitor for our semiconductor group is gsi group 
cognex is our principal competitor in the field of machine vision 
our electronic interconnect group competes with laser systems provided by hitachi via mechanics  mitsubishi electric and sumitomo

risk factors factors that may affect future results the statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact  including without limitation statements containing the words believes  expects and similar words  constitute forward looking statements that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
from time to time we may make other forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that such forward looking statements are subject to an inherent risk that actual results may materially differ 
the following information highlights some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
factors that may result in such variances include  but are not limited to  the following the industries that comprise our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable 
our business depends upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of components and circuitry used in wireless communications  computers and other electronic products 
in the past  the markets for electronic devices have experienced sharp downturns 
during these downturns  electronics manufacturers  including our customers  have delayed or canceled capital expenditures  which has had a negative impact on our financial results 
we cannot assure you when demand for our products will increase or that demand will not decrease 
even if demand for our products does increase  there may be significant fluctuations in our profitability and net sales 
during any downturn  it will be difficult for us to maintain our sales levels 
as a consequence  to maintain profitability we will need to reduce our operating expenses 
for example  in december we announced an operational restructuring and reduction in force to reduce our expenses in connection with the most recent downturn 
our ability to quickly reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expense and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings 
additionally  we may be unable to defer capital expenditures and we will need to continue to invest in certain areas such as research and development 
an economic downturn may also cause us to incur charges related to impairment of assets and inventory write offs and we may also experience delays in payments from our customers  which would have a negative effect on our financial results 
delays in manufacturing  shipment or customer acceptance of our products could substantially decrease our sales for a period 
we depend on manufacturing flexibility to meet the changing demands of our customers 
any significant delay or interruption in receiving raw materials or in our manufacturing operations as a result of software deficiencies  natural disasters  or other causes could result in reduced manufacturing capabilities or delayed product deliveries  any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents in addition  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of a relatively small number of products 
consequently  shipment and or customer acceptance delays  including acceptance delays related to new product introductions or customizations  could significantly impact recognition of revenue and could be further magnified by announcements from us or our competitors of new products and technologies  which announcements could cause our customers to defer purchases of our systems or purchase products from our competitors 
any of these delays could result in a material adverse change in our results of operations for any particular period 
failure of critical suppliers of parts  components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely and cost effective manner could negatively affect our business 
we use a wide range of materials in the production of our products  including custom electronic and mechanical components  and we use numerous suppliers for those materials 
we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
we seek to reduce the risk of production and service interruptions and shortages of key parts by selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key parts  monitoring the financial stability of key suppliers and maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers  some key parts are available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers in the short term 
operations at our suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including changes in business relationships  competitive factors  work stoppages  and fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
such disruption could interrupt our manufacturing 
our business may be harmed if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our production requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
we depend on a few significant customers and we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
our top ten customers for fiscal accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal  with three customers each accounting for more than of total net sales in fiscal in addition  none of our customers has any long term obligation to continue to buy our products or services  and any customer could delay  reduce or cease ordering our products or services at any time 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  and to compete effectively we must continually introduce new products that achieve market acceptance 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
our future performance will depend on the successful development  introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address technological changes as well as current and potential customer requirements 
the introduction by us or by our competitors of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products  which may harm our operating results 
in the past we have also experienced delays in new product development 
similar delays may occur in the future 
we also may not be able to develop the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements or  where necessary  to license these technologies from others 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 

table of contents the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  if at all  or on a timely basis 
further  we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
any failure to respond to technological change that may render our current products or technologies obsolete could significantly harm our business 
our ability to reduce costs is limited by our need to invest in research and development 
our industry is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development 
because of intense competition in the industries in which we compete  if we were to fail to invest sufficiently in research and development  our products could become less attractive to potential customers  and our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our need to maintain our spending levels in this area  our operating results could be materially harmed if our net sales fall below expectations 
in addition  as a result of our emphasis on research and development and technological innovation  our operating costs may increase in the future  and research and development expenses may increase as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of net sales 
we are exposed to the risks that others may violate our proprietary rights  and our intellectual property rights may not be well protected in foreign countries 
our success is dependent upon the protection of our proprietary rights 
in the high technology industry  intellectual property is an important asset that is always at risk of infringement 
we incur substantial costs to obtain and maintain patents and defend our intellectual property 
for example  we have initiated litigation alleging that certain parties have violated various patents of ours  such as the action we initiated in taiwan against all ring tech co  ltd 
in august we rely upon the laws of the united states and of foreign countries in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products to protect our proprietary rights 
however  these proprietary rights may not provide the competitive advantages that we expect or other parties may challenge  invalidate or circumvent these rights 
further  our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some foreign countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the united states 
many us companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement in foreign countries 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries  it could be easier for our competitors to sell competing products in foreign countries  which could result in reduced sales and gross margins 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement 
several of our competitors hold patents covering a variety of technologies  applications and methods of use similar to some of those used in our products 
from time to time  we and our customers have received correspondence from our competitors claiming that some of our products  as used by our customers  may be infringing one or more of these patents 
competitors or others have in the past and may in the future assert infringement claims against our customers or us with respect to current or future products or uses  and these assertions may result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to use intellectual property rights of others 
if claims of infringement are asserted against our customers  those customers may seek indemnification from us for damages or expenses they incur 
if we become subject to infringement claims  we will evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives  which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question or defending our position 

table of contents these licenses  however  may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all 
if we are not able to negotiate the necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or successfully defend our position  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business is highly competitive  and if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we face substantial competition from established competitors  some of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products 
new companies may enter the markets in which we compete  or industry consolidation may occur  further increasing competition in those markets 
furthermore  our technological advantages may be reduced or lost as a result of technological advances by our competitors 
our competitors greater resources in the areas described above may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns  compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology  and more quickly develop enhancements to and new generations of products 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including performance of our products  quality of our products  reliability of our products  cost of using our products  the ability to upgrade our products  consistent availability of critical components  our ability to ship products on the schedule required  quality of the technical service we provide  timeliness of the services we provide  our success in developing new products and enhancements  existing market and economic conditions  and price of our products as compared to our competitors products 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future  and increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share 
the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract  retain and assimilate sufficient numbers of managerial  financial  engineering and other technical personnel could have a material effect upon our results of operations 
our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  financial  engineering and technical personnel as well as our ability to continue to attract  retain and assimilate additional personnel 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we may not be able to retain our key managerial  financial  engineering and technical employees 
attracting qualified personnel may be difficult and our efforts to attract and retain these personnel may not be successful 
in addition  we may not be able to assimilate qualified personnel  including any new members of senior management  which could disrupt our operations 

table of contents our worldwide direct sales and service operations expose us to employer related risks in foreign countries 
we have established direct sales and service organizations throughout the world 
a worldwide direct sales and service model in foreign countries involves certain risks 
we are subject to compliance with the labor laws and other laws governing employers in the countries where our operations are located and as a result we may incur additional costs to comply with these local regulations 
additionally  we may encounter labor shortages or disputes that could inhibit our ability to effectively sell  market and service our products 
if we cannot effectively manage the risks related to employing persons in foreign countries  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may make acquisitions in the future  and these acquisitions may subject us to risks associated with integrating these businesses into our current business 
although we have no commitments or agreements for any acquisitions  in the future we may make acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control  including difficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel  operations  technologies and products of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies  lack of synergy  or inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance by the acquired company  and difficulties establishing satisfactory internal controls at acquired companies 
our inability to effectively manage these acquisition risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition the ownership percentage of our existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by our existing shareholders could be diluted 
if we use cash to pay for an acquisition the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or to use for other purposes 
in addition  the accounting for future acquisitions could result in significant charges resulting from amortization of intangible assets related to such acquisitions 
we may make strategic investments in development stage companies  which investments are subject to a high degree of risk  and therefore it is possible that we could lose our entire investment 
we are exposed to the risks of operating a global business  including risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations  legal and regulatory changes and the impact of regional and global economic disruptions 
international shipments accounted for of net sales in fiscal  with of our net sales to customers in asia 
we expect that international shipments will continue to represent a significant percentage of net sales in the future 
our non us sales  purchases and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including the following periodic local or geographic economic downturns and unstable political conditions  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuation in the relative values of currencies  difficulties protecting intellectual property  
table of contents local labor disputes  shipping delays and disruptions  increases in shipping costs  caused by increased fuel costs or otherwise  which we may not be able to pass on to our customers  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable  managing suppliers  distributors and representatives  and repatriation of earnings 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the possibility of regional or global economic disruptions including those resulting from natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious disease  the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
in particular  due to these uncertainties we are subject to the risk that future tightening of immigration controls may adversely affect the residence status of non us engineers and other key technical employees in our us facilities or our ability to hire new us employees in such facilities  the risk of more frequent instances of shipping delays  and the risk that demand for our products may not increase or may decrease 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and stock price 
in connection with our fiscal audit  we documented and tested our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls  particularly those related to revenue recognition  are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
our reported results of operations will be materially and adversely affected by our adoption of sfas r 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which will be effective in our first quarter of fiscal  will result in recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to our stock incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this standard  we generally have not recognized any compensation expense related to stock option grants or the discounts we provide under our employee stock purchase plan 
under the new rules  we will be required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to employee stock awards  which will lead to substantial additional compensation expense and will have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during the periods presented 

table of contents our tax rates are subject to fluctuation  which could impact our financial position  and our estimates of tax liabilities may be subject to audit  which could result in additional assessments 
our effective tax rates are subject to fluctuation as the income tax rates for each year are a function of a the effects of a mix of profits losses earned by esi and our subsidiaries in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  b our ability to utilize recorded deferred tax assets  c taxes  interest or penalties resulting from tax audits and d changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws 
changes in the mix of these items may cause our effective tax rates to fluctuate between periods  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
significant judgment is exercised in determining our world wide provisions for income taxes 
furthermore  we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of tax audits and examinations could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax accruals 
for example  in the third quarter of fiscal  a significant tax benefit was recorded upon the reversal of accrued income taxes due to the statutory closure of returns for various open tax years 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an examination  a material effect on our financial results  tax positions or cash flows could occur in the period or periods in which the determination is made

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview electro scientific industries  inc and its subsidiaries esi provide high technology manufacturing equipment to the global electronics market  including advanced laser systems that are used to microengineer electronic device features in high volume production environments 
our customers are primarily manufacturers of semiconductors  passive components and electronic interconnect devices 
our equipment enables these manufacturers to achieve the yield and productivity gains in their manufacturing processes that can be critical to their profitability 
the components and devices manufactured by our customers are used in a wide variety of end products in the computer  consumer electronics and communications industries 
we supply advanced laser microengineering systems that allow electronics manufacturers to physically alter select device features during high volume production  in order to heighten performance and boost production yields of semiconductor devices  advanced semiconductor packaging  flex circuits and passive components and circuitry 
laser microengineering comprises a set of precise fine tuning processes laser trimming  link cutting and via drilling that require application specific laser systems able to meet semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturers exacting performance and productivity requirements 
additionally  we produce high speed test  inspection and termination equipment used in the high volume production of mlccs and other passive components  as well as oem machine vision products 
fiscal began in an environment of lower demand for our products  however  we experienced steady growth throughout the fiscal year 
orders of million in fiscal increased compared to orders of million in fiscal orders in the first quarter were million and grew to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase compared to prior year is primarily driven by growing demand in our electronic interconnect and passive component group orders 
although our semiconductor group experienced a decrease in fiscal orders compared to the prior fiscal year  orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal reflected growth compared to the third quarter of fiscal we anticipate continued strength in the memory link repair area as our customers experience growth in demand for higher density memory devices and ramp their nm production capability 
passive component group orders increased compared to the prior fiscal year  and have grown approximately in each of the two most recent fiscal quarters 
the recent increase in orders is primarily from customers in asia for both test and termination equipment 
our customers are reporting high levels of factory utilization and continued strong demand for the smallest mlcc products 
after a period when many manufacturers were cautious before placing equipment orders  we have begun to experience increases in demand for our passive component group products as our customers seek to cautiously increase capacity 
electronic interconnect group orders increased in fiscal compared to fiscal demand in this market continues to be driven primarily by single head uv drill system orders from flex circuit manufacturers 
fiscal shipments of million decreased million or compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to reduced semiconductor and passive component group shipments in the first half of fiscal backlog was million at the close of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal  representing an increase of 
gross margins were on net sales of million in fiscal compared to on net sales of million in fiscal operating expenses decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we have reduced fiscal selling  general and administration expenses by million compared to fiscal by maintaining a constant focus on efficient use of our resources 
this allowed us to increase our investment in research and development by million to million without increasing our overall annual level of operating expenses 

table of contents operating income decreased to million in the current fiscal year  compared to operating income of million in fiscal  primarily due to reduced gross profits 
offsetting this impact  increased interest income  reduced interest expense and a net benefit from income taxes in fiscal resulted in net income of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth results of operations data as a percentage of net sales

over the course of fiscal  however  demand for our products increased 
shipments in the first half of fiscal were million  compared to shipments in the latter half of fiscal of million 
as a result  total net sales increased sequentially each quarter in fiscal  from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
net sales by product group are as follows net sales in thousands net sales percent of total net sales net sales percent of total net sales semiconductor sg passive components pcg electronic interconnect eig during fiscal  net sales decreased in our sg and pcg product groups  while eig remained stable compared to fiscal sg sales decreased million or over the prior fiscal year  as demand peaked for semiconductor products in the first half of fiscal  and decreased thereafter consistent with the industry demand cycle 
net sales of sg products began to increase again in the latter half of fiscal and approached levels experienced in the first half of fiscal due primarily to increased unit sales of ir based systems as well as demand for our new uv based memory link processing system 

table of contents pcg sales in fiscal decreased million or compared to the prior year 
in the first quarter of fiscal  pcg sales reached a four quarter peak at approximately million 
subsequently  pcg quarterly net sales decreased sequentially for the remainder of fiscal and somewhat stabilized over the first three quarters of fiscal in a range of million to million per quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  pcg net sales increased to million due to a doubling in unit sales as compared to the first three quarters combined 
due to the increase in pcg orders in the latter half of fiscal and recent demand for passive components processed by our laser trim and passive test systems  we anticipate strong net sales of pcg products as we enter fiscal eig sales remained stable at million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  we estimate overall net sales to be in the range of to million 
gross profit gross profit was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal overall gross margin rates declined percentage points  resulting from lower overhead absorption per unit on reduced shipments  a shift in product sales mix within our product groups  competitive pricing pressure  an unfavorable margin impact from the sale of previous generation eig product and the impact of information systems and technology costs related to the implementation of a new erp system  as discussed below 
we estimate gross margins will be consistent in the first quarter of fiscal with the rates achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating expenses included in fiscal operating expenses are charges related to our implementation of a new erp system 
all business functions were allocated service charges according to the function s derived benefit 
total erp implementation expenses  net of capitalizable costs  were million  of which million is in included in cost of goods sold  million is included in research and development expenses and million is included in selling  service and administration costs

additionally  selling  service and administration expenses for fiscal and fiscal included million and million  respectively  in legal and professional fees related to the class action securities litigation and derivative lawsuits 

table of contents selling  service and administration costs in fiscal included million in costs related to the erp implementation 
exclusive of the impact of the erp implementation costs of million in fiscal and special charges in fiscal and fiscal as detailed above  selling  service and administration expenses decreased by million  primarily resulting from reduced compensation and commission expenses  decreased liability insurance premiums and a reduction in various professional service costs 
research  development and engineering expenses expenses associated with research  development and engineering totaled million of net sales for fiscal  representing a million increase from expenses of million of net sales for fiscal research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal included million in costs related to the erp implementation and fiscal expenses included million related to our fiscal restructuring plan 
exclusive of the impact of those charges  the million increase in research and development is primarily attributable to increased investment in funding for development projects  new technical capabilities and initiatives  including an increase in compensation costs due to a higher average headcount in fiscal compared to fiscal other spending increases included professional services for patent registration and maintenance fees as well as an increase in subcontracted services and materials used in research and development activities 
we will continue to emphasize research and development investments in the coming year in order to drive product innovation  new product offerings and penetration into emerging growth markets 
we estimate total operating expenses for selling  service and administration and research  development and engineering activities will be approximately million to million in the first quarter of fiscal included in the first quarter estimate is approximately million of pre tax stock compensation expense resulting from our first quarter adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payments  of which approximately million will be included in operating expenses and approximately million will be included in cost of goods sold 
other income expense interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase of million is due primarily to increased investment yields as a result of rising market interest rates  partially offset by lower average invested asset balances compared to fiscal  due to the liquidation of certain marketable securities in march to fund the redemption of million in convertible notes 
our investment income in the coming year will depend on our ability to generate and invest cash and obtain favorable returns on our investment assets 
interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to the redemption of the convertible notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the redemption of the convertible notes  we recorded charges totaling million in fiscal  comprised of a redemption premium of million and a non cash charge of million for unamortized debt issuance costs 
income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was million on pre tax income of million  compared to the income tax expense in the prior fiscal year of million on pretax income of million 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of compared to a provision of in fiscal the tax benefit in fiscal resulted from a million reduction in accrued income taxes due to the statutory closure of various tax years  offset by income tax expense of million and other discrete income tax expense items totaling million 
the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal is expected to be approximately  resulting from statutory tax rates and the negative impact of existing tax legislation surrounding research and experimentation 
table of contents credits and export tax incentives 
the effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation based upon the occurrence and timing of numerous discrete events  including  for example  changes in tax laws or their interpretations  extensions or expirations of research and experimentation credits  closure of tax years subject to examination and finalization of income tax returns 
in october the internal revenue service irs began an audit of the tax years ending in through during fiscal we reached an agreement with the irs on the tax return years under review 
the examination process required a special report to be submitted by the irs for congressional approval from the joint committee on taxation 
in fiscal  we received notice from the irs that the joint committee s review was completed without exception 
as a result  we received approximately million in tax refunds relating to those years 
additionally  we are subject to numerous ongoing state and foreign tax audits 
although the final outcome of these audits are uncertain  based on currently available information  management believes the ultimate resolutions will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
net income as a result of the factors discussed above  net income was million  or per basic and fully diluted share  compared to fiscal net income of million  or per basic and per fully diluted share

this trend began in the latter half of fiscal and continued well into the first half of fiscal strong fiscal sg sales were complemented by an increase of million or in pcg sales over the prior year 
several key customers placed orders to build capacity late in fiscal as a response to anticipated demand for end customer electronics products 
accordingly  fiscal pcg sales benefited significantly from the shipment of ending fiscal backlog 
eig sales increased million or compared to the prior fiscal year 
total net sales decreased sequentially each quarter in fiscal  from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter as the cycle of increasing demand experienced over fiscal softened 
the primary cause for the decrease was a moderate decline in sg sales and a more significant decline in sequential pcg sales 
sg sales volumes decreased in the latter half of fiscal yet remained at levels significantly above those experienced prior to the dram market upturn in fiscal pcg sales also decreased in the latter half of fiscal as manufacturers remained cautious about building capacity 
fourth quarter fiscal pcg sales of million were similar to those experienced prior to the market upturn in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents gross profit gross profit was million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal shipments in fiscal increased compared to fiscal the primary driver for increased gross margins compared to fiscal was a volume increase in production  shipments and revenues  which allowed for better factory utilization and improved overhead absorption  which was achieved without an increase in average annual headcount 
in addition  gross margin benefited from efficiency improvements in our manufacturing processes 
the proportionate sales for our three product groups were fairly consistent in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a result  there was no significant impact on gross margins resulting from changes in sales mix

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
refer to part ii  item note summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  inventory write downs  product warranty reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax benefits  expenses  deferred taxes and valuation allowances  loss contingencies  and long lived asset valuations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to the customer at the time of delivery of the product to a common carrier 
revenue is recognized upon such delivery  provided that fulfillment of acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
where the acceptance criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  or in the case of substantially new products  revenue is deferred until acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements  the fair values of any undelivered elements are deferred until the elements are delivered and acceptance criteria are met 
installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment and installation revenue is deferred until installation is complete 
historically  neither the costs of installation accrued nor the fair value of installation service revenue deferred has been significant 
revenues associated with sales to customers under local contracts in japan are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon customer acceptance  with the exception of sales to our distributor in japan  where revenues are recognized upon title transfer to the distributor 
we have no distributor relationships outside of japan 
revenues related to spare parts and consumable sales are recognized upon shipment 
revenues related to maintenance and service contracts are recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
revenues are difficult to predict  due in part to our reliance on customer acceptance for a portion of our revenues 
any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
inventory write downs we regularly evaluate the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product 
table of contents introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative uses for the inventory are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed quarterly for obsolescence by our engineering and operating personnel 
raw material obsolescence write downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
we record inventory write downs  when necessary  as an increase to cost of sales based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand into our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
product warranty reserves we evaluate obligations related to product warranties quarterly 
a standard one year warranty is provided on most products 
warranty charges are comprised of costs to service the warranty  including labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to the repairs 
inventory credits resulting from the return of repaired parts to inventory and any cost recoveries from warranties offered by our suppliers for defective components are recorded as a credit to the warranty accrual 
using historical data  we estimate average warranty cost per system or part type and record the provision for such charges as an element of cost of goods sold 
additionally  the overall warranty accrual balance is separately analyzed using the remaining warranty periods outstanding on systems and items under warranty  and any resulting changes in estimates are recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales upon shipment 
if circumstances change  or if a material change in warranty related incidents occurs  the estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
accrued product warranty is included on the balance sheet as a component of accrued liabilities 
our warranty expense in fiscal totaled million 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established by reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
on certain foreign sales  we require letters of credit 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we talk with the customer to determine the cause 
if we determine that the customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information then available 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
we record estimated bad debts quarterly as an increase to selling  service and administration expenses 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and our bad debt expense in fiscal was a credit of million 
deferred taxes and tax reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be fully realized  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
should management s assumptions and expectations be inaccurate  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods 
at june   our net deferred tax assets totaled million  which included a valuation allowance of million 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we have reserves for taxes to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be 
table of contents challenged by taxing authorities  even though the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are appropriate 
tax reserves are reviewed as warranted and adjusted as events occur that affect the company s potential liability for additional taxes 
loss contingencies where we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate 
because of uncertainties relating to litigation  however  the amount of our estimates could be wrong 
moreover  plaintiffs may not specify an amount of damages sought 
long lived asset valuations long lived assets  principally property and equipment and identifiable intangibles held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
