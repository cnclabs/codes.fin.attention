item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a incorporating item a in this report  the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation opc and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas and chemical 
strategy general occidental aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using the following strategy focus on large  long lived oil and gas assets with long term growth potential  maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet  and manage the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures 
occidental prefers to own large  long lived legacy oil and gas assets  like those in california and the permian basin  that tend to have moderate decline rates  enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production 
management expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after invested capital 
at occidental  maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle 
during periods of high commodity prices  occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments 
the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy 
capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way  to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs 
asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and pvc businesses 
historically  the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements 
occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets 
as part of occidental s strategy to grow its oil and gas business  any excess cash generated by the chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas growth

the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry 
the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around occidental s core areas  which are the united states  the middle east north africa and latin america  pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir management practices  and maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
over the past several years  occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas 
occidental has invested in  and disposed of  assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets 
see oil and gas segment business review for a discussion of these changes 
in addition  occidental has made acquisitions and investments in the dolphin project in qatar and the uae  re entered libya and assumed operations in the mukhaizna field in oman for future growth opportunities  not for current production 
occidental s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields  beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california followed by a series of purchases in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico 
at the end of  the elk hills and permian basin assets made up percent of occidental s consolidated proven oil reserves and percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves 
on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis  they accounted for percent of occidental s consolidated reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  boe per day  which represents approximately percent of occidental s total worldwide production 
these assets also contributed approximately percent of oil and gas segment earnings

oxychem s strategy is to be a low cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation 
oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine  which is coproduced with caustic soda  and then converts chlorine and ethylene  through a series of intermediate products  into pvc 
oxychem s focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale 
key performance indicators general occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in total return to stockholders  return on equity  return on capital employed  and other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced  cost to produce each unit  cash flow per unit  cost to find and develop new reserves  reserve replacement percentage and other similar measures 
debt structure occidental s total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below date amounts in millions total debt a total debt to capitalization ratio a includes trust preferred securities redeemed january   natural gas delivery commitment terminated in  subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations 
as shown  occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio declined to percent from the percent level that existed at the end of the decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in compared with resulted from total debt reductions of percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of percent over the same period 
return on equity annual a three year average b a the return on equity for was calculated by dividing occidental s earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in b the three year average return on equity was calculated by dividing the average earnings applicable to common stock over the three year period by the average equity balance over the same period 
occidental has focused on improving its return on equity 
in  occidental s return on equity was percent and the three year average return on equity was percent 
during the same three year period  occidental increased its stockholders equity by percent and its quarterly dividend by percent and its stock price increased by percent 
oil and gas segment business environment oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s financial performance 
oil prices strengthened in over levels 
during the year  occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average west texas intermediate wti price and occidental s realized prices 
however  occidental s realized price as a percentage of wti was percent for both years 
prices and differentials can vary significantly  even on a short term basis  making forecasting realized prices difficult 
the average wti market price for was per barrel compared with per barrel in occidental s average realized price for oil in was  compared with in average nymex domestic natural gas prices increased approximately percent from for  nymex gas prices averaged mcf compared with mcf for business review all production and reserve figures are net to occidental unless otherwise specified

elk hills occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california s san joaquin valley with an approximate percent interest 
the field was acquired in for billion and is the largest producer of gas in california 
oil and gas production in was approximately  boe per day 
during  occidental performed infill drilling  field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques 
a record new wells were drilled and wells were worked over 
in addition  a successful co pilot was completed during the year 
as a result of these activities  occidental was able to maintain production at levels 
since its acquisition  total elk hills oil and gas production has been approximately million boe 
at the end of  the property had an estimated million boe of proved reserves  compared to the million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 
permian basin the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states  with the entire basin accounting for approximately percent of total united states oil production 
occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with an approximately percent net share of the total permian basin oil production 
occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl in the permian basin 
most of occidental s permian basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of altura in for approximately billion 
in  occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately billion 
this was partially offset by cash proceeds totaling million from dispositions of a portion of the acquired properties 
occidental s total share of permian basin oil  gas and ngl production averaged  boe per day in compared to  boe per day in at the end of  occidental s permian basin properties had billion boe in proved reserves 
occidental s permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas 
the largest producing areas in included wasson san andres  slaughter  levelland  north cowden and wasson clearfork  which contributed percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  to occidental s permian boe production 
occidental s interests in the permian basin offer additional development and exploitation potential 
during  occidental drilled approximately wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests 
occidental conducted significant development activity on five co projects during  including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing co floods 
occidental also focused on improving performance of existing wells 
occidental had an average of well service units working in the permian area during performing well maintenance and workovers 
approximately percent of occidental s permian basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of carbon dioxide co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery technique 
this involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent  causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells 
the size of these co flood operations makes occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 
thums occidental purchased thums  the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore long beach  california  in occidental s share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc  whereby occidental s share of production varies inversely with oil prices 
for  production from thums averaged  barrels per day 
gulf of mexico occidental has a one third interest in the deep water horn mountain oil field  which is occidental s only asset in the gulf of mexico 
bp plc bp is the operator 
for  occidental s production at horn mountain averaged  boe per day 
in the second half of  the horn mountain field was shut down for about days due to the impact of the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
hugoton and other occidental owns other oil and gas interests including a large concentration of gas reserves  production interests and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma 
the hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered in north america 
occidental s hugoton and other operations produced mmcf of natural gas per day and  barrels of oil per day in occidental has over  net acres in the piceance basin in western colorado 
during and  occidental drilled development wells  installed a mmcf per day gas processing facility and the infrastructure required for future field development 
occidental has acquired seismic data covering square miles of the cascade creek field 
acquisition of vintage petroleum in january  occidental completed the merger of vintage petroleum  inc vintage into a wholly owned occidental subsidiary 
occidental acquired producing assets in argentina  the united states  yemen and bolivia 
the argentine assets consist of concessions  of which occidental will operate  located in the san jorge basin in southern argentina and the cuyo basin in western argentina 
occidental paid billion to former vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued million shares for the stock portion  which was valued at billion 
the value of occidental s shares was determined by the average share price for the five day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement 
in addition  occidental assumed vintage s debt  which had an estimated fair market value of million at closing 
occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets 
middle east north africa dolphin project occidental s investment in the dolphin project  which was acquired in  consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities 
one entity  oxy dolphin e p  llc  owns a percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a development and production sharing agreement dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar s north field for years from the start of production  with a provision to request a year extension 
the purchase price of the undivided working interest in the dpsa was approximately million and was recorded in property  plant equipment 
this undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in occidental s financial statements 
a second entity  oxy dolphin pipeline  llc  owns percent of the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy 
the purchase price of dolphin energy stock totaled approximately million and was recorded as an equity investment 
dolphin energy is the operator under the dpsa on behalf of the three dpsa contractors  including occidental 
dolphin energy also has the rights to build  own and operate a mile long  inch natural gas pipeline  which will transport dry natural gas from qatar to the uae 
the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately billion in total 
occidental expects to invest approximately billion of this total 
the project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing 
during  occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately million for the gas exploration and development activity and the investment in dolphin energy  compared to million in in  the government of qatar approved the final field development plan for the dolphin project 
construction of a gas processing and compression plant at ras laffan in qatar  as well as two offshore gas production platforms  commenced in and is continuing 
the projected start up date for production is late based on existing supply contracts  the dolphin project is expected to export approximately billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas per day plus associated liquids and byproducts 
however  the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to bcf of natural gas per day 
demand for natural gas in the uae and oman continues to grow and dolphin energy s customers have requested additional gas supplies 
to help fulfill this growing demand  dolphin energy will pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from qatar 
to date  occidental has recorded million boe of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the dolphin project dpsa activity 
no revenue or production costs were recorded in for the dolphin project gas exploration and development activity 
qatar in addition to the dolphin project  occidental participates in two production projects in qatar idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd 
occidental is nearing completion of phase ii of full field development of isnd and is in the process of developing the issd field 
occidental expects to continue increasing production and recoverable reserves under its existing agreement in the isnd field 
phase ii is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir characterization techniques 
capital expenditures in qatar for the issd and isnd projects were million in and are expected to be million in occidental s net share of combined production from the two fields averaged  barrels per day in yemen in yemen  occidental owns a percent direct working interest in the masila field in block and a percent interest in the east shabwa field  comprising a percent direct working interest and an percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity 
occidental s production averaged  barrels of oil per day in  with  coming from the masila field and the remainder from east shabwa 
in addition  occidental is the operator of block  where it owns an percent working interest 
in july  occidental was the successful bidder for block in yemen s exploration bid round and has been invited to finalize a psc for the block 
oman occidental s oman business includes block and block  where it holds a percent working interest in each  and block  where it holds a percent working interest 
occidental is the operator of all three blocks where production averaged  boe per day in  with  boe coming from block and the remainder from block the block agreement provides for two ten year extensions and occidental has agreed with the government of oman to the first ten year extension through december  in march  occidental began selling gas to the government of oman under a gas sales agreement  thereby allowing occidental to produce previously stranded gas and condensates from block under the agreement  occidental and its block partner must supply approximately mmcf per day of natural gas until december  thereafter  occidental will nominate quantities that it has available for delivery 
in  occidental and its partner supplied an average of approximately mmcf per day of natural gas to the government under the gas sales agreement 
the minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement through december  represent approximately percent of the expected average gross production of gas from block during that period 
as of december   the gross proved gas reserves from block are approximately percent of the total minimum of gas that remains to be delivered under the gas sales agreement 
in october  occidental received approval for development of the khamilah field in block the exploitation term of the agreement is years beginning in september occidental plans to develop the reserves and commence production in block through capital efficient investment and exploration 
occidental and its block partners signed a new psc for the mukhaizna field with the government of the sultanate of oman in july on september   occidental assumed operations of the mukhaizna field  where it holds a percent working interest 
the mukhaizna field  located in oman s south central interior  was discovered in and was brought into production in primary production peaked in the same year at  barrels of oil per day and by september  had declined to  barrels of oil per day 
occidental plans to use horizontal well steamflood technology to steadily increase production 
libya occidental suspended all activities in libya in as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the united states government 
during the imposition of sanctions  occidental derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests 
in  the united states government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against libya 
however  libya continues to be designated as a country supporting international terrorism under section j of the united states export administration act and  as such  continues to be subject to certain limited sanctions 
on august   the libyan authorities approved the terms of occidental s participation in the assets that it left in  effective as of july  the agreement allows occidental to return to its libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were suspended 
those assets consist of three producing contracts in the sirte basin and four exploration blocks 
occidental paid approximately million in re entry bonuses  capital adjustment and work in progress payments and is required to pay million per year while it continues to operate in libya  as reimbursements for past development costs associated with the historical assets 
in addition  occidental committed to spend million over the next five years in the four exploration blocks 
currently  occidental s rights in the producing fields extend through and early occidental had its first lifting from its libyan operations in late september and production during the fourth quarter of averaged  boe per day 
separately  in early  occidental participated in the epsa iv exploration bid round in libya 
occidental successfully bid on nine of the areas available 
occidental is the operator for five onshore areas and has a percent exploration working interest 
in addition  occidental holds a percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas 
woodside petroleum ltd 
is the operator for the offshore areas 
occidental paid approximately million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to spend an additional million over the next five years 
other eastern hemisphere pakistan occidental holds oil and gas working interests  that vary from to percent  in four badin blocks in pakistan 
bp is the operator 
occidental s share of production was approximately  boe per day in russia in russia  occidental owns percent of a joint venture company  vanyoganneft  that operates in the western siberian oil basin 
production for was approximately  boe per day 
latin america colombia occidental is the operator of the ca o lim n field with a percent share of production  declining to percent by mid and percent by in mid  if wti exceeds per barrel  occidental s share of production will decline an additional amount based on a sliding scale 
occidental s share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day 
colombia s national oil company  ecopetrol  operates the ca o lim n cove as oil pipeline and marine export terminal 
the pipeline transports oil produced from the ca o lim n field for export to international markets 
in september  occidental signed a new agreement with ecopetrol for an enhanced oil recovery project in the la cira infantas field  located in central colombia 
if conditions warrant  upon completion of the two pilot phases  occidental will earn a percent net share of production upon further development 
in november  ecopetrol approved development of the caricare field  an exploration discovery under the rondon association contract  adjacent to ca o lim n 
production from this field  where occidental holds a percent working interest  is expected to commence in may occidental holds various working interests in two additional exploration blocks 
ecuador occidental operates block in ecuador in which it holds a percent economic interest 
although occidental holds legal title to percent of the block participation contract  it farmed out percent of its economic interest related to block in occidental s share of production averaged approximately  barrels of oil per day in in addition  occidental has a percent interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd 
ocp oil export pipeline 
development of existing fields  primarily eden yuturi and the indillana complex  continued through drilling and the installation of new wells nearly offset the natural decline of existing wells 
foreign oil companies  including occidental  have been paying a value added tax vat  generally calculated on the basis of to percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export 
until  oil companies  like other companies producing products for export  filed for and received reimbursement of vat 
in  the ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement 
in  occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the ecuadorian government under the united states ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on occidental s belief that the ecuadorian government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental 
in july  a tribunal of international arbitrators awarded occidental compensation for vat refunds from occidental s block operations that were withheld by the ecuadorian government and indicated that similar vat refunds should be paid going forward 
the ecuadorian government has appealed the tribunal s decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential effect on occidental s financial statements would not be material 
in september  occidental received formal notification that petroecuador  the state oil company of ecuador  was initiating proceedings to determine if occidental had violated either its participation contract for block or the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the participation contract 
block operations represent approximately percent of occidental s consolidated production  percent of its proved consolidated reserves  and percent of its total property  plant and equipment pp e  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
in august  petroecuador issued a report recommending that the minister of energy declare the termination of occidental s participation contract for block the principal allegation stated in the notice and the petroecuador report is an assertion that occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout agreement entered into in in november  the minister of energy  following the procedure set forth in the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law  requested that occidental respond to the allegations against it 
in february  occidental submitted its response to the minister of energy  in which occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations under the participation contract and ecuadorian law  and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation 
occidental has been cooperating with the ecuadorian authorities in these proceedings  and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution 
occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings  but if there were to be a negotiated settlement  it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of block operations 
see also off balance sheet arrangements ecuador for further information about the ocp pipeline 
production sharing contracts occidental conducts its operations in qatar  oman and yemen under pscs and  under such contracts  receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
in addition  occidental s share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
proved reserves evaluation and review process a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data 
in addition  a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee has been established  consisting of senior corporate officers  to monitor and review occidental s oil and gas reserves 
the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental s board of directors periodically throughout the year 
occidental retained ryder scott company  lp ryder scott  independent petroleum engineering consultants  to review its oil and gas reserve estimation processes in and ryder scott compared occidental s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and reviewed certain data  methods and procedures used in estimating reserve volumes  the economic evaluations and reserve classifications 
ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental s total reserves portfolio 
based on this review  including the data  technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental  ryder scott concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards 
ryder scott was not engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by occidental 
proved reserve additions occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end of  million boe  as compared with the year end amount of  million boe 
additionally  occidental s investments in other interests had proved reserves of million and million boe at year end and  respectively 
the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was million boe  of which million boe were from proved developed reserves and million boe were from proved undeveloped reserves 
proved developed reserves represent approximately percent of occidental s total proved reserves 
proved reserve additions consolidated subsidiaries in millions of boe proved developed proved undeveloped proved total revisions due to change in price other revisions improved recovery extensions and discoveries purchases total additions proved reserves are percent crude oil and condensate and percent natural gas 
revisions of previous estimates in  occidental had net negative revisions of its proved reserves of million boe due to changes in price 
the decrease was mainly due to negative revisions of million boe from the dolphin project  qatar  oman and yemen where reserve amounts decrease when prices rise 
these revisions were partially offset by positive revisions at domestic operations in elk hills and the permian basin 
if oil prices increased by per barrel  less oil volume is required to recover costs  and pscs would reduce occidental s share of proved reserves by approximately million boe 
conversely  if oil prices dropped by per barrel  occidental s share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount 
oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts  in a manner partially offsetting the psc reserve volume changes 
apart from the effects of product prices  occidental s approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 
improved recovery in  occidental added reserves of million boe through improved recovery  mainly in the permian basin  elk hills  and thums in the united states and also in qatar 
in an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil and gas production from the elk hills field  occidental has successfully implemented an infill drilling program 
the elk hills operations employ both gas flood and water flood techniques 
in the permian basin  the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques  such as drilling additional co flood and water flood wells 
extensions and discoveries occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on successful exploitation programs 
in  occidental added reserves of million boe  with million boe in the united states and million boe in the middle east 
in western colorado  occidental added approximately million boe from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations  most of which will require additional development capital 
the success of improved recovery  extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements  as well as oil and gas prices  capital costs and operating costs 
many of these factors are outside of management s control  and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 
purchases of proved reserves in  occidental purchased reserves of million boe  of which million boe are in the united states 
the reserve additions in the united states were from various acquisitions  primarily in the permian basin  of which percent were proved developed reserves 
occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices 
acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms 
as market conditions change  the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 
proved undeveloped reserves in  occidental s proved undeveloped reserves increased by million boe 
this net increase resulted from improved recovery  extensions  discoveries and purchases  primarily in the elk hills field  in the permian basin  in western colorado and in the dolphin project 
the dolphin project accounted for percent of the increase  and the projected start up for dolphin production is late these proved undeveloped additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of development programs 
for details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas  see the supplemental oil and gas information unaudited section in item industry outlook the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
worldwide oil prices in remained at or near historical highs 
continued economic growth  resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability  could result in continued high prices 
a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 
historically  sustained high or low oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the wti price has averaged approximately per barrel over the past ten years 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices 
during  occidental experienced an increase in its price differential of the average wti price over occidental s realized prices 
see the oil and gas segment business environment section above for further information 
while local supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence 
over the last ten years  the nymex gas price has averaged per mcf 
chemical segment business environment the chemical segment experienced improved results in due to sustained demand coupled with improved margins despite sharply higher feedstock costs 
the widespread impact of hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter caused several disruptions among chlor alkali producers and their customers 
this resulted in a moderate softening of product demand 
business review chlor alkali demand for chlor alkali products began the year quite strong  which enabled oxychem to realize robust margins despite escalating energy and raw material costs 
while chlorine and caustic prices continued to rise throughout the year  the combination of softening demand  partly due to hurricanes katrina and rita  and the rapid rise in energy and feedstock costs caused operating rates and profitability to fall in the latter part of the year 
key sectors  such as vinyls and pulp and paper  were operating at full capacity in the first half  resulting in a tight supply demand balance for chlorine and caustic soda 
although demand remained relatively strong in the second half of the year  margins came under pressure as product became more available and industrial customers reduced purchases to control inventories and bolster cash flow 
domestic chlorine demand fell percent compared to  as several sectors experienced slowdowns late in the year  which resulted in de stocking of inventory amid the expectation of lower prices 
despite starting the year operating at near capacity  chlor alkali industry operating rates fell to percent for the year  down from percent in oxychem s chlor alkali operating rate for was percent  slightly above the industry operating rate of percent 
in september  oxychem decided to permanently close its deer park  texas and delaware city  delaware chlor alkali production facilities  and its edc facility in ingleside  texas 
these sites were closed because they were not expected to regain an economically viable operating position in the future 
vinyls increasing ethylene and natural gas prices led to a continuation of industry pvc price increases in industry pvc prices increased percent compared to these increases led to record high price levels in the fourth quarter of industry wide total demand was percent lower compared with oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of percent for  compared to the north american industry average of percent 
in december  oxychem announced that it would permanently close its alberta  canada pvc manufacturing facility in the first quarter of acquisition of vulcan assets in june  occidental completed the purchase of three chlor alkali chemical manufacturing facilities from vulcan for million in cash  plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these facilities and the assumption of certain liabilities 
in order to facilitate receipt of regulatory approval for this acquisition  occidental divested one of the facilities 
exit of vinyl specialty resins business at the end of  occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins business for strategic and economic reasons 
this resulted in the immediate closure of the pottstown  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
occidental recorded an after tax charge of million in and classified this business as a discontinued operation 
industry outlook occidental s chemical business experienced improved profitability in  percent higher than s earnings 
the major factors that contributed to this improved performance were the continued strong united states economy  higher margins and the acquisition of certain vulcan chemical operating assets 
continued strong performance will depend on global economic activity  the competitiveness of the united states in the world economy and the direction of the unprecedented high levels of feedstock and energy prices and their impact on margins 
reduced demand due to softening in the united states economy and continuation of the historically high levels of feedstock and energy prices could affect operating margins and reduce future profitability 
construction of lng terminals on the united states gulf coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower than current level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient gulf coast chemical facilities 
however  this construction may not occur in the immediate future 
chlor alkali industry operating rates ended at percent of capacity  which is a considerable decline from s performance of percent 
demand growth is expected to be moderate despite the potential positive effect of gulf coast rebuilding efforts 
however  due to the currently high level of energy and other key raw material costs  margins are expected to remain under pressure 
moreover  a significant portion of results were due to sharply higher caustic soda prices versus this price increase has led to additional united states imports and intense competition among producers for market share 
vinyls industry wide pvc operating rates are expected to be slightly lower in as a result of the restart of some idled capacity coupled with lower housing starts and reduced exports 
vcm rates are expected to improve as dow chemical company completes the announced shutdown of two production facilities 
the growing cost disparity in the vinyls chain between the united states gulf coast and southeast asia  as well as the growth of acetylene based pvc capacity in china  have resulted in a dramatic shift in trade flows and imports of pvc into the united states and latin america 
corporate and other corporate and other includes the investments in lyondell chemical company lyondell and premcor  inc  premcor  and a leased cogeneration facility in taft  louisiana 
the premcor investment was sold in beginning in  corporate and other also included the results of a  mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the permian basin  which was acquired in january  and is used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations 
lyondell in november  lyondell acquired millennium chemicals inc millennium by issuing additional shares of lyondell common stock 
under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 occidental was required to record its share of the increase in lyondell s net equity resulting from this issuance 
the effect of this was an increase in the carrying value of occidental s investment in lyondell and a pre tax gain of million 
as a result of the stock issuance  occidental s ownership percentage of lyondell decreased from approximately percent to percent 
in  occidental sold million shares of lyondell common stock for gross proceeds of approximately million 
this sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
at december   occidental still owned million shares of lyondell common stock percent ownership  with a carrying value of million and a fair market value of million  and warrants to purchase an additional five million shares of lyondell common stock 
occidental has no current plans to divest the remaining lyondell shares 
however  occidental regularly reviews and analyzes its investments and other operations in order to determine how its stockholders interests are best served 
occidental continues to account for this investment on the equity method since it has the ability to exercise significant influence over lyondell 
premcor in  valero energy corp 
valero and premcor executed a merger agreement for valero to acquire premcor 
occidental tendered its million shares of premcor common stock for cash and shares of valero common stock pursuant to the premcor valero agreement

significant items affecting earnings occidental s results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature  timing and amount 
therefore  management uses a measure called core earnings  which excludes those items 
this non gaap measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management s performance  but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing occidental s earnings performance between periods 
reported earnings are considered representative of management s performance over the long term 
core earnings is not considered to be an alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

an annual tax election permits a taxpayer to claim either a credit or a deduction for foreign income taxes  whichever is more beneficial 
occidental expects to continue its election to credit foreign income taxes in future years

assets see cash flow analysis for discussion about the increase in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in trade receivables is due to higher product prices and oil and gas sales volumes during the fourth quarter versus the increase in receivables from joint ventures  partnerships and other was due to higher mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher account balances related to the oil and gas marketing and trading operations 
the higher balance in inventories is due to higher oil and gas marketing and trading inventory due to higher prices and volumes during the fourth quarter versus the higher inventory balance is also due to an increase in chemical inventories 
the increase in long term receivables reflects higher mark to market adjustments on long term derivative financial instruments 
the decrease in investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries is due to the sale of all of the shares of premcor common stock and a partial sale of the lyondell stock during the year 
the increase in property  plant and equipment reflects capital expenditures and acquisitions  partially offset by dd a expense 
liabilities and stockholders equity debt to capitalization a

a this ratio is computed by dividing year end total debt  as shown in the md a strategy key performance indicators debt structure  by the sum of year end total debt plus year end stockholders equity 
the decrease in current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities reflects the payment of the percent senior notes that were classified as current in the higher balance in accounts payable is due to higher prices and volumes for purchased oil and gas in occidental s marketing and trading operations 
the increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to higher mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher accruals mainly related to the vulcan acquisition 
the higher balance in domestic and foreign income taxes current reflects additional taxes payable due to higher income 
the lower balance for long term debt is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout the year 
the decrease in deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes reflects the reduction in deferred taxes resulting from derivative activity in other comprehensive income oci related to the production hedges and the sale of all of the shares of valero common stock 
the higher balance in deferred credits and other liabilities other is due to an increase in long term derivative liabilities related to crude oil production hedges  accruals related to the permian basin and vulcan acquisitions and additional stock based compensation liabilities  partially offset by the reduction in liabilities related to the irs settlement and the reversal of tax reserves no longer required due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations 
the increase in stockholders equity reflects higher net income  partially offset by dividends paid and the impact of the crude oil production hedges in oci 
liquidity and capital resources at december   occidental had approximately billion in cash and short term investments on hand  an increase of almost billion from although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production  occidental believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs  capital expenditure requirements  dividend payments  potential acquisitions and its announced common stock repurchase program 
if needed  occidental could access its existing credit facilities 
available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately billion at december  occidental s billion bank credit matures on june  none of occidental s committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidental s ability to borrow under these lines 
occidental s credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 
at december   under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements  occidental s capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately billion  and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on  and for acquisitions of  occidental s capital stock was approximately billion  assuming that such dividends  distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing

in july  dolphin energy  the operator of the dolphin project  entered into an agreement with banks to provide a billion bridge loan for the dolphin project 
occidental guaranteed percent of the obligations of dolphin energy under the bridge loan 
in july  dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to refinance the billion bridge loan with a new bridge loan in an amount of billion 
the proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on the billion bridge loan and will be used to fund the construction of the dolphin project 
the new bridge loan has a term of four years and is a revolving credit facility  which may be converted to a term loan 
in september  dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a billion islamic law compliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the dolphin project 
this four year financing facility is structured as a transaction in which dolphin energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the dolphin project on behalf of a group of islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion 
occidental guarantees percent of both of these obligations of dolphin energy 
at december   occidental s portion of the bridge loan drawdown was approximately million  of which million is recorded on the balance sheet 
the remaining amount is discussed in off balance sheet arrangements guarantees below 
there were no draw downs on the islamic law compliant facility at december  in the first quarter of  occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of various securities 
as of december   no securities had been issued under this shelf 
in january  occidental completed the vintage acquisition and paid billion to former vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued million shares for the stock portion  which was valued at billion 
the value of occidental s shares was determined by the average share price for the five day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement 
in addition  occidental assumed vintage s debt  which had an estimated fair market value of million at closing 
occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets 
cash flow analysis in millions net cash provided by operating activities the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from several factors 
the most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and  to a much lesser extent  chemical prices 
although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which occidental operates  in  occidental s realized oil prices were higher overall by percent 
occidental s realized natural gas price increased over percent in the united states  where approximately percent of occidental s natural gas was produced in increases in the costs of producing oil and gas  such as purchased goods and services  and higher utility  gas plant and production taxes  partially offset oil and gas sales price increases  but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases 
other cost elements  such as labor costs and overheads  are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 
most major chemical prices increased in at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs  thereby improving profits and cash flow 
the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes  not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment  but also because of increases in energy price driven feedstock and electric power costs  which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segment s products 
sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in  but this did not have a significant effect on occidental s earnings and cash flow 
the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and  to a much lesser extent  chemical prices 
in  occidental s realized oil prices were higher overall by percent and the realized united states natural gas price increased over percent 
oil and gas worldwide production  on a boe basis  increased for overall by over percent on a daily basis  as compared with  which also contributed to increased cash flow 
increases in sales prices realized for occidental s major chemical product lines ranged from zero to percent  compared to chemical prices increased in at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs  thereby improving profits and cash flow 
the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes 
sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in  but this did not have a significant effect on occidental s earnings and cash flow 
increases in the costs of production partially offset sales price increases  but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases 
other non cash charges to income in include chemical asset write downs  deferred compensation  stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals 
other non cash charges in include deferred compensation  stock incentive plan amortization  environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset writedown 
other non cash charges in include deferred compensation  stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals 
in millions net cash used by investing activities the amount includes the cash payments for several permian basin acquisitions  the acquisition of the vulcan chlor alkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to re enter libya and to assume operations of the mukhaizna field in oman 
these were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the premcor valero shares and the lyondell shares

occidental s capital spending estimate for is approximately billion 
most of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas exploration  production and development activities in elk hills  the permian basin  oman  qatar and the dolphin project 
commitments at december   for major capital expenditures during and thereafter were approximately million 
occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in the course of its business activities  occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives 
the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed 
occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities 
these transactions  or groups of transactions  are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and  unless otherwise noted  are not reflected on occidental s balance sheets 
the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 
dolphin project see oil and gas segment business review middle east and liquidity and capital resources for further information 
ecuador in ecuador  occidental has a percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline 
as of december   occidental s net investment and advances to the project totaled million 
occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting 
the project was funded in part by senior project debt 
the senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador  including occidental 
under their ship or pay commitments  occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks  including operating risk  political risk and force majeure risk 
occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure  upstream expropriation events  bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company  abandonment of the project  termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador  or certain defaults by occidental 
this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt 
at december   occidental s obligation relating to the pipeline company s senior project debt totaled million  and occidental s obligations relating to performance bonds totaled million 
occidental s overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline company s senior project debt 
leases occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements  mainly for railcars  power plants  manufacturing facilities and office space 
occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility 
lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales 
see the contractual obligations table below 
guarantees occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds  letters of credit  indemnities  commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties  mainly to provide assurance that opc and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 
at december   the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million relates to occidental s guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments 
the debt guarantees and other commitments primarily relate to the dolphin energy equity investment and the investment in the ecuador ocp pipeline  which are discussed above 
the remaining million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties

c other liabilities include accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities 
d amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income 
e includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business 
some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations 
due to their long term nature  purchase contracts with terms greater than years are discounted using a percent discount rate 
f amounts exclude purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists 
lawsuits  claims commitments contingencies and related matters opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
opc and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and similar federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  however  occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including environmental proceedings  occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
since april  oxychem has been served with eight lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately  individual plaintiffs 
these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide 
oxychem is aware of  but has not been served in  additional cases in nicaragua  which occidental understands make similar allegations 
oxychem has no assets in nicaragua and  in the opinion of management  these claims are without merit because  among other things  oxychem believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in nicaragua 
under the applicable nicaraguan statute  defendants are required to pay pre trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense 
in previous situations  involving other defendants  nicaraguan courts have proceeded to enter significant judgments against the defendants under that statute 
oxychem has filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre trial deposit 
in december  the judge in one of the cases the osorio case  ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants  including oxychem  and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre trial deposit 
oxychem has appealed that portion of the ruling relating to the jurisdiction of the nicaraguan courts 
thereafter  the trial court ordered defendants  including oxychem  to file an answer 
in order to preserve its jurisdictional defense  oxychem elected not to make a substantive appearance in the case 
in august  the judge in the osorio case entered judgment against several defendants  including oxychem  for damages totaling approximately million 
in the opinion of management  any judgment rendered under the statute  including in the osorio case  would be unenforceable in the united states 
in september  occidental received formal notification that petroecuador  the state oil company of ecuador  was initiating proceedings to determine if occidental had violated either its participation contract for block or the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the participation contract 
block operations represent approximately percent of occidental s consolidated production  percent of its proved consolidated reserves  and percent of its total pp e  net of accumulated dd a 
in august  petroecuador issued a report recommending that the minister of energy declare the termination of occidental s participation contract for block the principal allegation stated in the notice and the petroecuador report is an assertion that occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout agreement entered into in in november  the minister of energy  following the procedure set forth in the ecuadorian hydrocarbons law  requested that occidental respond to the allegations against it 
in february  occidental submitted its response to the minister of energy  in which occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations under the participation contract and ecuadorian law  and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation 
occidental has been cooperating with the ecuadorian authorities in these proceedings  and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution 
occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings  but if there were to be a negotiated settlement  it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of block operations 
see also off balance sheet arrangements ecuador for information about the ocp pipeline 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal  state  local and foreign tax jurisdictions 
disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 
in may  occidental entered into a closing agreement with the irs resolving certain foreign tax credit issues as part of the irs audit of tax years the closing agreement was completed after an extensive irs review of various complex tax issues and negotiations between occidental and the irs 
as a result of the closing agreement  occidental recorded a tax benefit of million in for the reversal of tax reserves that were previously established for those foreign tax credit issues 
in addition  occidental recorded a tax benefit of million in due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as united states corporate returns for tax years became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations 
these tax benefits did not have a significant current cash effect 
occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity  drilling services  electrical power  steam and certain chemical raw materials 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
see off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations for further information 
occidental has certain other commitments under contracts  guarantees and joint ventures  including purchase commitments for goods and services at market related prices and certain other contingent liabilities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for further information 
some of these commitments  although not fixed or determinable  involve capital expenditures and are part of the billion capital expenditures estimated for occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental 
these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds 
as of december   occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters 
if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental s reserves  an outcome not currently anticipated  it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  after taking into account reserves  management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality 
foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites  comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites  including occidental facilities and previously owned sites 
also  opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc  which reports its results directly to occidental s corporate management 
the following table presents occidental s environmental remediation reserves at december   and grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites amounts in millions of sites reserve balance of sites reserve balance of sites reserve balance cercla equivalent sites active facilities closed or sold facilities total the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years in millions balance beginning of year increases to provision including interest accretion changes from acquisitions payments other balance end of year occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years 
occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites 
the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to million beyond the amount accrued 
for management s opinion  refer to the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section above 
cercla and equivalent sites at december   opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in cercla or state equivalent proceedings  as shown below 
description amounts in millions of sites reserve balance minimal no exposure a reserves between mm reserves over mm total a includes sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental  sites where occidental has denied liability without challenge  sites where occidental s reserves are less than  each  and sites where reserves are between  and million each 
the eight sites with individual reserves over million in include a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee  two closed landfills in western new york  groundwater treatment facilities at four closed chemical plants montague  michigan  hicksville  new york  western new york and tacoma  washington and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in western new york 
active facilities certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at active facilities 
five facilities a chemical plant in louisiana  a phosphorus recovery operation in tennessee  a chemical plant in texas  a chemical plant in kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states account for percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 
closed or sold facilities there are sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which occidental or its subsidiaries are involved 
four sites account for percent of the reserves associated with this group 
the four sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions  a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania  a closed oxychem chemical plant in pennsylvania and a water treatment facility at a former oxychem chemical plant in north carolina 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion are located in the middle east north africa  approximately billion are located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder are located in the other eastern hemisphere region 
for the year ended december   net sales outside north america totaled billion  or approximately percent of total net sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental s management 
there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years 
the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas properties occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
at the completion of drilling activities  the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found 
if no proved reserves have been found  the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense 
in some cases  a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling  requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells 
occidental s practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete 
occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 
annual lease rentals and exploration  geological  geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 
several factors could change occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves 
occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
in other contractual arrangements  sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
these factors  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves 
pscs also affect reserves 
as prices increase  occidental s share of proved recorded reserves decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase 
an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
occidental s revisions to proved reserves were negative for and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for the year 
the negative revisions in were primarily a result of psc price effects 
in and  revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for each year 
additionally  occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly 
there have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years 
if occidental s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate 
for example  a percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel  which would increase pre tax income by million annually 
a percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million annually 
dd a of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves 
the change in the dd a rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 
a portion of the carrying value of occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties  net of accumulated valuation allowance  were million 
these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted 
as exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 
chemical assets the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its pp e 
occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities 
the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical assets  which range from years to years  are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests 
the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained 
without these continued expenditures  the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease 
other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy prices  environmental regulations  competition and technological changes 
over the prior three years  the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial 
occidental performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  or when management s plans change with respect to those assets 
occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value 
the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy costs  significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life 
due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products  occidental temporarily idled an edc plant in june and a chlor alkali plant in december subsequent to the purchase of the vulcan chemical assets  occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations 
as a result of this review  occidental recorded a million pre tax charge for the write off of these two previously idled chemical plants and one currently operated plant and a pre tax additional charge of million for the writedown of another chemical plant in occidental s net pp e for chemicals is approximately billion and its depreciation expense for is expected to be approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense 
for example  a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
the environmental reserves are based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available 
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable 
the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established 
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable 
for the years ended december  and  occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 
many factors could result in changes to occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss 
the most significant are the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate 
modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results 
occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective 
such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater  or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results 
should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives  more intensive or costly measures may be required 
the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction 
site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates  anomalies in subsurface geology  interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones  or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources 
the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action 
additionally  other events might occur that could affect occidental s future remediation costs  such as the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated 
for some sites with impacted groundwater  accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling 
migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected 
additionally  the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures 
improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation 
in particular  for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance  the development of more effective treatment technology  or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation  could significantly affect remediation costs 
laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements 
at sites involving multiple parties  occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability 
when other parties are jointly liable  the financial viability of the parties  the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidental s ultimate share of liability 
based on these factors  occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties  with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable  in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories category cercla or state equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations  category oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost  and category contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 
in all three of these categories  occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities  as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 
in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures  which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites  occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems 
to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data  laws  regulations  technologies or engineering estimates  occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis 
if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
for example  if the reserve balance were to decrease by percent  occidental would record a pre tax gain of million 
if the reserve balance were to increase by percent  occidental would record an additional remediation expense of million 
other loss contingencies occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits  claims  proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations 
occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  occidental discloses  in aggregate  its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred 
occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 
these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate 
management s judgments could change based on new information  changes in laws or regulations  changes in management s plans or intentions  the outcome of legal proceedings  settlements or other factors 
significant accounting changes listed below are significant changes in accounting principles 
eitf issue no 
in september  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  which provides accounting guidance about whether buy sell arrangements should be accounted for at historical cost and whether these arrangements should be reported on a gross or net basis 
buy sell arrangements typically are contractual arrangements where the buy and sell agreements are entered into in contemplation of one another with the same counterparty 
occidental reports all buy sell arrangements on a net basis and at historical cost 
this eitf is effective in the first interim period beginning after march   and occidental will prospectively adopt this statement in the second quarter of occidental is currently assessing the effect of eitf issue no 
 but does not expect it to have a material effect on its financial statements 
fin no 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement obligations under the provisions of sfas no 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are mainly related to plant decommissioning 
under fin  which occidental adopted on december   occidental is required to record the fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
however  occidental believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which occidental may settle these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated 
therefore  occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these liabilities 
occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values 
sfas no 
r on july   occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payments  under the modified prospective transition method 
since most of occidental s existing stock based compensation was already being recorded in the income statement  occidental decided to early adopt sfas r  so that the remaining awards would be accounted for in a similar manner 
prior to july   occidental applied the accounting principles board apb opinion no 
intrinsic value accounting method for its stock incentive plans 
under the modified prospective transition method  the fair value recognition provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after july  additionally  the fair value of existing unvested awards at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period 
results from prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of  occidental recorded a million after tax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information

fsp fas in may  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which specifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for the prescription drug benefits that are available under this new plan 
occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of this pronouncement in the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
fin r revised in december  the fasb revised fin to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of fin occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements when adopted 
sfas no 
effective january  occidental adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the initial adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in an after tax charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
the adoption increased net pp e by million  increased asset retirement obligations by million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by million 
eitf issue no 
in october  occidental adopted certain provisions of eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
as a result of adopting eitf issue no 
 there were no changes to gross margins  net income  cash flow  or earnings per share for any period  however  net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement 
from to  occidental accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf issue no 
required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings  whether the contracts were derivatives or not 
in october  the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 
thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties 
also  the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement  whether or not they are physically settled  if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of and recorded an million after tax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
derivative activities and market risk general occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations 
a derivative is an instrument that  among other characteristics  derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 
in general  the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 
commodity price risk general occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately million 
if natural gas prices vary by per mcf  it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately million 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices  however  changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins 
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million and million  respectively  pre tax annual effect on income 
if pvc prices vary by 
lb  it would have approximately a million pre tax annual effect on income 
if edc prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million pre tax annual effect on income 
historically  price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes  therefore  the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated 
according to chemical market associates  inc  december average contract prices were chlorine ton  caustic soda ton  pvc lb and edc ton 
marketing and trading operations occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas 
derivatives are also used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization  which operates under established policy controls and procedures 
with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental utilizes a combination of futures  forwards  options and swaps to offset various physical transactions 
occidental s use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases  which includes occidental s periodic gas storage activities 
risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying  selling  marketing  trading  and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy 
the chief financial officer and the risk management committee  comprising members of occidental s management  oversee these controls  which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer 
the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities 
controls for energy commodities include limits on credit  limits on trading  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts the following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of occidental s marketing and trading contracts  a portion of which are hedges  during and and segregate the open contracts at december  by maturity periods 
in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year losses gains on changes for contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions losses gains or other changes in fair value a fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year a primarily relates to production hedges

the underlying prices for years through are based on the year end nymex published prices  as published monthly prices are not available 
these prices are input into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value 
production hedges during the first quarter of  occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges for the sale of its crude oil production 
these hedges  which began in july and continue to the end of  hedge less than percent of occidental s crude oil production 
information about these cash flow hedges  which are included in the total fair value of million in the table above  is presented in a tabular presentation below

this method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a percent level of confidence 
the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of interest rate risk general occidental s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations 
in  occidental terminated all of its interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges 
these hedges had effectively converted approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately million  which is being amortized into income over the remaining life of the previously hedged debt 
the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower  as a result of the swaps and amortization of the deferred gain  by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks  which qualified as cash flow hedges 
the hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by occidental that was completed in december the unamortized loss on the hedges at december  was approximately million after tax  which is recorded in accumulated oci and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of years on a straight line basis 
certain of occidental s equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges 
occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cash flow hedges in oci

credit risk occidental s energy contracts are spread among several counterparties 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits  and manages credit enhancement issues 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure and losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial 
foreign currency risk a few of occidental s foreign operations have currency risk 
occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
most international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  all of occidental s oil and gas consolidated foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial
