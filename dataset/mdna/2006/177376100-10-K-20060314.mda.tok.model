item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and market technology solutions that enable on demand access to information and applications 
we market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers  channel distributors  system integrators  independent software vendors  our websites and original equipment manufacturers 
acquisitions acquisitions during  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies  netscaler  inc and teros  inc  or the acquisitions  for a total of million in cash  approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and estimated direct transaction costs of million 
as of december   there were outstanding commitments for the issuance of shares of our common stock related to the purchase consideration for the acquisitions of approximately million  which was recorded as an accrued expense in our consolidated balance sheet 
we also assumed approximately million in unvested stock based compensation upon the closing of the transaction that was accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
and was recorded as deferred compensation in our consolidated balance sheet 
the assumed awards had an excess of fair value over intrinsic value of approximately million  which is reflected in the total consideration for the transactions 
the acquisitions are intended to further extend our leadership in application delivery solutions 
the results of operations of the acquired companies are included as part of our results beginning after their dates of acquisition and revenues from the acquired products are included in our product license revenue and technical services revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
the sources of funds for consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments  borrowings on our senior revolving credit facility  or the credit facility  and shares of our authorized common stock 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our credit facility 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price for each of the acquisitions was allocated to the acquired company s net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of each acquisition 
the allocation of the total purchase price is summarized below in thousands purchase price allocation asset life current assets property and equipment  various in process research and development intangible assets  years goodwill  indefinite other assets total assets acquired current liabilities long term liabilities total liabilities assumed net assets acquired  including direct transaction costs current assets and current liabilities acquired in connection with the acquisitions consisted mainly of cash  accounts receivable  inventory  deferred revenues and other accrued expenses 
other assets consisted primarily of deferred tax assets and long term deposits 
long term liabilities assumed as part of the acquisitions consisted primarily of the long term portion of deferred revenues and deferred tax liabilities 
in connection with the purchase price allocation  we have estimated the fair value of the support  maintenance  product delivery and training obligations we assumed from the acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of these obligations was determined by utilizing a cost build up approach plus a normal profit margin 
we did not include any costs associated with selling efforts  research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs as they were not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of the respective acquisitions 

table of contents intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions are comprised of core technologies  customer relationships  trade name and covenants not to compete 
the valuation of product technology was based on the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the acquisitions existing products 
the value of customer relationships was determined based on the acquisitions estimated future discounted cash flows of the relationships in place after considering historical and expected buying patterns of customers  expected cash flows from current customers  the duration of support contracts and the application of charges of other contributory assets 
the valuation of the trade name for the acquisitions was determined based on assigning a royalty rate to the revenue stream that was expected from the products using the trade name 
the pre tax royalty rate was applied to the product revenue and discounted to a present value 
the value of the covenants not to compete was determined by using a discounted income approach that considered the value of the agreements in place adjusted for competition  among other things 
the goodwill recorded in relation to the acquisitions was assigned to the americas segment and is not deductible for tax purposes 
acquisitions during  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies net  inc  a leader in providing secure access gateways and expertcity 
com  inc  a leader in web based desktop access as well as a leader in web based meeting and customer assistance services  together  the acquisitions 
the consideration for the acquisitions was approximately million comprised of approximately million in cash  million of direct transaction costs and approximately million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
the common stock valued at million included million related to the initial purchase price and the remaining balance is primarily related to additional common stock earned by the former stockholders of expertcity 
com  inc upon the achievement of certain revenue and other financial milestones during pursuant to the applicable merger agreement  which was issued in march the fair value of the common stock earned as additional purchase price consideration was recorded as goodwill on the date earned 
in connection with the acquisitions  we allocated million to goodwill  million to core and product technology and million to other intangible assets 
we assigned million of the goodwill to our americas segment and million of the goodwill to our online services division 
the sources of funds for consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments and our authorized common stock 
there is no additional contingent consideration related to these acquisitions 
in process research and development we expensed purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  of approximately million related to the acquisitions and million related to the acquisitions immediately upon the closing of the acquisitions 
for more information regarding the ipr d acquired from acquisitions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
we sell our access suite products bundled with an initial subscription for license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is allocated to the delivered product using the residual method and recognized at the outset of the arrangement as the licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on vsoe  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for license updates 
in the normal course of business  we do not permit product returns  but we do provide most of our distributors and value added resellers with stock balancing and price protection rights 
in accordance with the provisions of our warranties  we also provide end users of our products the right to replacement products  as applicable 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and december  we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  and december  we also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
if market conditions were to decline  we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
core and product technology assets 
we review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
we have acquired our core and product technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill 
at december   we had million in goodwill primarily related to our acquisitions  acquisitions and our acquisition of sequoia software corporation 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these 
table of contents acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we operate in a single market consisting of the design  development  marketing and support of access infrastructure software  hardware and services 
our revenues are derived from sales in the americas region  europe  the middle east and africa  or emea region  and the asia pacific region and from our online services division 
these three geographic regions and the online services division constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill along these segments  which represent our reporting units 
substantially all of our goodwill at december  was associated with our americas and online services reportable segments 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of december  there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy  product portfolio or reportable segments  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
current and deferred tax assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company has approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income  gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
stock based compensation disclosures our stock based compensation program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to attract and reward talented employees and align stockholder and employee interest 
the number and frequency of our stock based awards are based on competitive practices  our operating results  the number of shares available for grant under our shareholder approved plans and other factors 
all employees are eligible to participate in our stock based compensation program 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  defines a fair value method of accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity instruments 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
pursuant to sfas no 
 companies are not required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock based transactions 
companies are permitted to account for such transactions under accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but are required to disclose in a note to the consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if a company had applied the methods prescribed by sfas no 
as of december   we had two stock based compensation plans under which we granted stock options and shares of non vested stock 
in addition  we assumed stock based employee compensation plans in our and 
table of contents acquisitions  but no additional awards will be granted under these assumed plans 
we are currently granting stock based awards from our equity incentive plan and our employee stock purchase plan 
our board of directors has provided that no new awards will be granted under our other plans  however  awards previously granted under these plans and still outstanding will continue to be subject to all the terms and conditions of such plans  as applicable 
we typically grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees and non employee directors with an exercise price equal to or above the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we apply the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our plans except for certain unvested awards assumed as part of our acquisitions  which were accounted for in accordance with fin no 
stock based compensation cost has been reflected in net income for the amounts related to the awards assumed as part of and acquisitions  which had an exercise price below market value on the date of grant and non vested stock based awards granted as part of an overall retention program related to our acquisitions 
the impact of our fixed stock based compensation plans and our stock purchase plan on our consolidated financial statements from the use of options is reflected in the calculation of earnings per share in the form of dilution 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after june  january  for us 
as of the effective date  we will be required to expense all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased as well as the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or the modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits companies to restate either all prior periods presented or all prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
we currently estimate that our expense related to the fair value of options outstanding  as of december   will approximate the amount of sfas no 
expense that we reported for as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the full impact that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our reported results of operations in will depend on the levels of share based payments granted during as well as changes in our stock price and the assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of our stock awards 
had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  we believe that the impact of the adoption of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required under sfas no 
accordingly  this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend  among other things  on when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million in  million in and million in in addition  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we will also be required to reverse the deferred compensation currently recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
the reversal of the deferred compensation will be offset by a decrease in our additional paid in capital and will have no impact on our total stockholders equity

revenues 
our operations consist of the design  development  marketing and support of access products and services that enable on demand access to information and applications for our customers  which include individual consumers and professionals  small businesses and enterprises 
net revenues include the following categories product licenses  license updates  online services and technical services 
product licenses primarily represents fees related to the licensing of our access suite products  citrix netscaler products and our citrix access gateway products 
these revenues are reflected net of sales allowances and provisions for stock balancing return rights 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our channel distributors and value added resellers to stimulate demand for our products 
revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our channel distributors and value added resellers 
our presentation server product accounted for approximately of our product license revenue for the year ended december   of our product license revenue for the year ended december  and of our product license revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in our presentation server product as a percent of our product license revenue when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  is due to an increase in sales of our citrix netscaler products  our access suite and our citrix access gateway products 
during  we expect our presentation server product to continue to decrease as a percent of our product license revenue due to expected increases in sales of our citrix netscaler products  our access suite and our citrix access gateway products 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are 
table of contents recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
online services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
technical services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term  as well as  revenues from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products  which is recognized as the services are provided 
year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands revenues product licenses license updates online services technical services total net revenues net revenues increased million during compared to product license revenue increased million during primarily due to increased sales of our new citrix netscaler products acquired in our acquisitions  increased sales of our access suite and increased sales of our citrix access gateway products  acquired in our acquisitions 
license updates revenue increased million during primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewals related to our subscription advantage program 
online services revenue increased million during primarily due to continued acceptance of new and existing products of our online services division 
technical services revenue increased million during primarily due to increased sales of consulting services related to implementation of our products and  to a lesser extent  services related to our new citrix netscaler products 
during  we currently expect product license revenue to increase due to an expected increase in revenue from sales of our citrix netscaler products and our citrix access gateway products 
we also currently expect modest revenue growth from our access suite products in in addition  we anticipate that subscription advantage will continue to be of strategic importance to our business in because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream 
online services revenues are also currently expected to increase in net revenues increased million during compared to product license revenue decreased million during primarily due to a weakness in our packaged product sales which are typically purchased by medium and small sized businesses 
license updates revenue increased million during primarily due to a larger base of subscribers and increasing renewal rates related to our subscription advantage program 
online services revenue increased million during primarily due to the addition of the online services division resulting from our february expertcity acquisition 
technical services revenue increased million during primarily due to increased sales of consulting services related to implementation of our products 
deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates revenue from our subscription advantage product  online services revenues from annual service agreements for our online services division and technical services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts 
deferred revenues increased approximately million compared to december  primarily due to increased renewals of subscription advantage  and increased sales of our online service agreements and  to a lesser extent  sales of services related to our new citrix netscaler products 
we expect deferred revenue to increase in due primarily to expected increases in both annual contract adoptions for online services division s products and increased subscription advantage renewals 
international and segment revenues 
international revenues sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december   and of our net revenues for the year ended december  the decrease in international revenue as a percent of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to increased sales performance in the united states and increased sales performance and growth in our online services division  which is comprised primarily of domestic revenues

also included in cost of revenues is amortization of core and product technology 
cost of product licenses revenues increased million in as compared to due primarily to sales of our citrix netscaler products  and sales of our citrix access gateway products both of which contain hardware components that have a higher cost than our other software products 
cost of services revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to increased sales in our online services division due to continued acceptance of our new and existing online products and  to a lesser extent  due to increased sales of consulting and technical support services related to our access suite products and sales of services related to our new citrix netscaler products 
amortization of core and product technology increased million in as compared to primarily due to amortization related to core and product technology acquired in acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of core and product technology was partially offset by other core and product technology assets becoming fully amortized during the year 
for more information regarding the acquisitions  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and note to our consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that in  cost of product license revenues will increase as compared to current levels as we currently expect sales of our citrix netscaler products and citrix access gateway products to increase 
our citrix netscaler products and citrix access gateway products have a higher cost of revenues than our software license products due to their hardware component 
in addition  in  we expect our cost of services revenues to increase due to increased sales of our online services products and an increase in technical support costs as we increase our customer base  have more frequent product releases and more complex products 
our reported total cost of revenues is also expected to increase due to increased compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents cost of product licenses revenues decreased million in as compared to due primarily to a decrease in royalties due to the expiration of certain license agreements 
cost of services revenues increased million in compared to primarily due to the addition of our online services division resulting from the february expertcity acquisition 
amortization of core and product technology decreased million in as compared to primarily due to the reclassification of certain intangible tax assets related to a acquisition from a product technology intangible asset to goodwill resulting in an approximately million reduction in amortization expense partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related to core and product technology intangible assets acquired in the expertcity acquisition 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percent of revenue was for  for and for the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenue in compared to was primarily due to the increase in cost of revenues as discussed above 
we currently expect our gross margin to decrease slightly in due to the factors discussed above under cost of revenues 
operating expenses our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
as a result of this practice  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher in the current year if the dollar was weak in the prior year

additionally  we enter into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares

off balance sheet arrangement during  we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we do not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
consequently  payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
we do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources 
for information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see contractual obligations 
the initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years 
upon approval by the lessor  we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods 
the lease payments vary based on libor  plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice  we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
upon at least days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term  we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment 
if an evaluation were to indicate that the fair value of the property were to decline below million  we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted cash  cash equivalent or investment balance of approximately million as collateral  which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance of million  excluding our collateralized investments  equity investments and outstanding debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments in excess of this required level 
the synthetic lease includes non financial covenants  including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised  which replaced fin no 
fin no 
revised was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor  the leased facility or 
table of contents the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with fin no 
revised 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt in a future period 
commitments capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities  software purchases related to improving our internal infrastructure and leasehold improvements 
over the next months  we currently expect capital expenditures to increase due to the planned implementation of certain systems to streamline business operations and enhance management reporting capabilities 
during and  we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices  including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
lease obligations related to these existing operating leases continue to with a total remaining obligation at december  of approximately million  of which million was accrued for as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates  and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counter parties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  australian dollars  japanese yen  swiss francs  canadian dollars and hong kong dollars 
to reduce exposure to reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of million and at december  these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would increase the liability by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million  resulting in a net asset position 
foreign operating costs in these hypothetical movements would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities 
we maintain available for sale investments in debt securities  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
during the third quarter of  we have terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements due to the sale of the underlying available for sale investments 
for more information see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
during our subsidiary entered into the credit facility and the term loan 
accordingly  we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
this exposure relates to our million credit facility and our million term loan 
borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we have no amounts outstanding on the credit facility as of december  as of december   we had million outstanding under the term loan 

table of contents borrowings under the term loan currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our subsidiary s level of total debt and adjusted ebitda 
pursuant to the terms of the term loan agreement  we have the ability to elect a rate of interest for periods of one  three or six months 
as of december   we had set the interest rate on the term loan through the date of repayment 
the term loan was paid in full in february in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters 
payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate libor plus a margin 
based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to interest rate exposure  if the fair value of our headquarters building in fort lauderdale  florida were to significantly decline  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
