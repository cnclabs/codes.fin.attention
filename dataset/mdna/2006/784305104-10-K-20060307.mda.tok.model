since balances are being tracked and have to be approved by the cpuc before they can be incorporated into rates  san jose water company has not recognized the expenses in the balancing account on its financial statements 
the memorandum type balancing account balance varies with the seasonality of the water utility business such that during the summer months when the demand for water is at its peak  the balancing account tends to reflect an under collection  while during the winter months when demand for water is relatively lower  the account tends to reflect an over collection 
had the memorandum type balancing account been recognized in san jose water company s financial statements  san jose water company s retained earnings would be decreased by the amount of the account over collection  as the case may be  or increased by the amount of the account under collection  less applicable taxes
