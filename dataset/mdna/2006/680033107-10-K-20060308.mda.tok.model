item a 
risk factors old national s business could be harmed by any of the risks noted below 
in analyzing whether to make or to continue an investment in old national  investors should consider  among other factors  the following risks related to old national s business old national operates in an extremely competitive market  and old national s business will suffer if old national is unable to compete effectively 
in old national s market area  the company encounters significant competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market mutual funds and other financial intermediaries 
the company s competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than old national does and may offer services that old national does not or cannot provide 
old national s profitability depends upon old national s continued ability to compete successfully in old national s market area 
the loss of key members of old national s senior management team could adversely affect old national s business 
old national believes that old national s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of old national s senior management 
their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit old national 
the competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense  and the loss of any of old national s key personnel or an inability to continue to attract  retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect old national s business 

table of contents old national s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
the bank originates commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  agricultural real estate loans  agricultural loans  consumer loans  and residential real estate loans primarily within old national s market areas 
commercial real estate  commercial  consumer  and agricultural loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate 
these loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
commercial loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower s business 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
agricultural loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either the bank or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates 
if old national s actual loan losses exceed old national s allowance for loan losses  old national s net income will decrease 
old national makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of old national s loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of old national s borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of old national s loans 
despite old national s underwriting and monitoring practices  old national s borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms  and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance 
as a result  old national may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on old national s operating results 
since old national must use assumptions regarding individual loans and the economy  old national s current allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses 
old national may need to significantly increase old national s provision for losses on loans if one or more of old national s larger loans or credit relationships becomes delinquent or if old national expands old national s commercial real estate and commercial lending 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review old national s allowance for loan losses and may require old national to increase the provision for loan losses or recognize loan charge offs 
material additions to old national s allowance would materially decrease old national s net income 
there can be no assurance that old national s monitoring procedures and policies will reduce certain lending risks or that old national s allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover actual losses 
if old national forecloses on collateral property  old national may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property  resulting in reduced revenues 
old national may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect old national s investment and may thereafter own and operate such property  in which case old national will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate 
the amount that old national  as a mortgagee  may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of old national s control  including  but not limited to i general or local economic conditions  ii neighborhood values  iii interest rates  iv real estate tax rates  v operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  vi environmental remediation liabilities  vii ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  viii zoning laws  ix governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  and x acts of god 
certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate  principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs  may adversely affect the income from the real estate 
therefore  the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property  and old national may have to advance funds in order to protect old national s investment  or old national may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss 
the foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect old national s ability to generate revenues  resulting in reduced levels of profitability 

table of contents a breach of information security or compliance breach by one of our agents or vendors could negatively affect old national s reputation and business 
old national relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing  communication and information exchange 
despite the safeguards instituted by old national  such systems are susceptible to a breach of security 
in addition  old national relies on the services of a variety of third party vendors to meet old national s data processing and communication needs 
if confidential information is compromised  financial losses  costs and or other damages could occur 
such costs and or losses could materially affect old national s earnings 
fiduciary activity risk factor old national is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to old national s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to old national they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of old national and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the old national s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the old national s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the banking industry changes in economic and political conditions could adversely affect old national s earnings  as old national s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing old national s loans decline 
old national s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic and political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  money supply and other factors beyond old national s control may adversely affect its asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the old national s earnings 
because old national has a significant amount of real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of old national s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
in addition  substantially all of old national s loans are to individuals and businesses in old national s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in old national s market area which includes indiana  kentucky  illinois  and ohio could have an adverse impact on old national s earnings 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect old national s results of operations and financial condition 
old national s earnings depend substantially on old national s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates old national earns on loans  securities and other earning assets and ii the interest rates old national pays on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond old national s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
as market interest rates rise  old national will have competitive pressures to increase the rates old national pays on deposits  which may result in a decrease of old national s net interest income 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which old national is subject may adversely affect old national s results of operations 
old national operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of comptroller of the currency occ  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve and the state of indiana 
see business supervision and regulation herein 
applicable laws and regulations may change  and such changes may adversely affect old national s business 
such regulation and supervision of the activities in which an institution may engage is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of 
table of contents assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing institutions  could have a material impact on old national and its operations 
changes in technology could be costly 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  old national needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  can be high in both absolute and relative terms 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that old national s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of old national 
risks related to old national s stock federal regulations may inhibit a takeover  prevent a transaction that may favor or limit old national s growth opportunities  which could cause the market price of old national s common stock to decline 
certain provisions of old national s charter documents and federal regulations could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of old national 
in addition  old national must obtain approval from regulatory authorities before acquiring control of any other company 
the price of old national s common stock may be volatile  which may result in losses for investors 
general market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of old national s common stock 
the following factors may cause the market price for shares of old national s common stock to fluctuate announcements of developments related to old national s business  fluctuations in old national s results of operations  sales of substantial amounts of old national s securities into the marketplace  general conditions in old national s banking niche or the worldwide economy  a shortfall in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts expectations  lack of an active trading market for the common stock  changes in analysts recommendations or projections  and old national s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects 
we may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice 
old national has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to stockholders 
the payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions 
any payment of dividends in the future will depend  in large part  on old national s earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors considered relevant by old national s board of directors

however  old national also has some and year fixed rate mortgage pass through securities in its held to maturity investment portfolio 
at december   old national does not believe any individual unrealized loss on available for sale securities represents other than temporary impairment

lending and loan administration in  due to continued credit quality concerns  old national implemented certain credit approval disciplines in order to continue to focus on the reduction of problem and non performing loans in the portfolio  including a restructuring of the manner in which commercial loans are analyzed and approved 
community based lending personnel  along with region based independent underwriting and analytic support staff  extend credit under guidelines established and administered by old national s risk and credit policy committee 
this committee  which meets quarterly  includes members from both the holding company and the bank  as well as outside directors 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  problem loans and 
table of contents charge offs and reviews and approves recommended loan policy changes to assure it remains appropriate for the current lending environment 
old national lends primarily to small and medium sized commercial and commercial real estate clients in various industries including manufacturing  agribusiness  transportation  mining  wholesaling and retailing 
as measured by old national at december   the company had no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of its portfolio and has no exposure to foreign borrowers or lesser developed countries 
four measured industry categories  lessors of residential buildings and dwellings  lessors of nonresidential buildings  crop farming  and durable goods wholesale trade did exceed internal guidelines which set out recommended maximum limits of loan commitments as a percent of capital 
old national s policy is to concentrate its lending activity in the geographic market areas it serves  primarily indiana  illinois and kentucky

allowance for loan losses and asset quality administration old national monitors the quality of its loan portfolio on an on going basis and uses a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining its allowance for loan losses 
old national records provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  loan risk grades  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for the company s highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect old national s borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
old national has a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews conducted at selected bank locations as well as regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
each month  problem loan reports are prepared and reviewed  which include borrowers that show indications of being unable to meet debt obligations in the normal course of business  and loans which have other characteristics deemed by bank management to warrant special attention or have been criticized by regulators in the examination process 
classified loans include non performing loans  loans past due days or more and other loans deemed to have well defined weaknesses while criticized loans  also known as special mention loans  are loans that are deemed to have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and also require monthly reviews by the bank 
assets determined by the various evaluation processes to be under performing are closely monitored by old national management 
under performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans where the ultimate collectibility of interest or principal is uncertain  loans renegotiated in some manner  primarily to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal payments because the borrower s financial condition deteriorated  loans with principal or interest past due ninety days or more  and foreclosed properties 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest become days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  interest accrued during the current year is reversed against earnings  interest accrued in the prior year  if any  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
cash received while a loan is classified as nonaccrual is recorded to principal 

table of contents adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are made as deemed necessary for losses inherent in the portfolio 
while an estimate of probable losses is  by its very nature  difficult to precisely predict  management of old national believes that the methodology that it uses in determining an appropriate reserve for expected losses is reasonable 
we monitor differences between estimated and actual loan losses 
this process includes quarterly assessments by senior management of the loan portfolio and the models used to estimate losses in the portfolio 
loan officers and credit underwriters jointly grade the larger commercial and commercial real estate loans in the portfolio periodically as determined by loan policy requirements or determined by specific guidelines based on loan characteristics as set by management and banking regulation 
periodically  these loan grades are reviewed independently by the loan review department 
for impaired loans  an assessment is conducted as to whether there is likely loss in the event of default 
if such a loss is determined to be likely  the loss is quantified and a specific reserve is assigned to the loan 
for the balance of the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  loan grade migration analysis coupled with historic loss experience within the respective grades is used to develop reserve requirement ranges 
a loan is considered impaired under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of fasb statement no 
and when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
an impaired loan does not include larger groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value  leases and debt securities 
old national uses migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for non retail loans that are not impaired 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that estimates inherent losses for existing pools of loans based on the historic loss experience of the subject pools 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of inherent losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
old national calculates migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate a range of possible outcomes 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans 
allowance for loan losses and asset quality at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  a decrease of million compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans  including loans held for sale  the allowance decreased to at december   from at december  during  the provision for loan losses amounted to million  remaining relatively flat compared to in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the amount of the allowance for unfunded loan commitments is classified as a liability account on the balance sheet during and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments decreased million to million at december  primarily as a result of a change in the projected utilization rates used in the modeling 
for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the reserve decreased by million at december   compared to december  the reserve as a percentage of that portfolio decreased to at december   from at december  the absolute level of classified and criticized loans at december   decreased from december  the reserve for residential real estate loans as a percentage of that portfolio increased to at december   from at december  this increase was reflective of a higher residential real estate loan loss rate used to calculate reserve need for december  compared to the same period for the reserve for consumer loans increased to at december   from at december  this was reflective of the increased losses experienced in this portfolio due  in part  to the change in consumer bankruptcy laws in late

old national has been affected by weakness in the economy of its markets  which has resulted in minimal growth of commercial loans and tighter credit underwriting standards 
management expects that trends in under performing  criticized and classified loans will be influenced by the degree to which the economy strengthens 
old national operates in the midwest  primarily in the state of indiana  which has been particularly negatively affected by the weakness in the manufacturing segment of the economy 
the longer this softness in manufacturing continues the more stress it puts on old national s borrowers  increasing the potential for additional nonaccrual loans and loan losses

allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on reviews of individual loans  pools of homogeneous loans  assessments of the impact of current and anticipated economic conditions on the portfolio and historical loss experience 
the allowance represents management s best estimate  but significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance in the near future 
likewise  an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in 
table of contents the required allowance 
in either instance  unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on results of operations 
the allowance is increased through a provision charged to operating expense 
uncollectible loans are charged off through the allowance 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that contractual interest and principal payments will not be collected either for the amounts or by the dates as scheduled in the loan agreement 
old national s policy for recognizing income on impaired loans is to accrue interest unless a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal or interest becomes days past due unless it is well secured and in the process of collection  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest 
old national monitors the quality of its loan portfolio on an on going basis and uses a combination of detailed credit assessments by relationship managers and credit officers  historic loss trends  and economic and business environment factors in determining its allowance for loan losses 
old national records provisions for loan losses based on current loans outstanding  grade changes  mix of loans and expected losses 
a detailed loan loss evaluation on an individual loan basis for the company s highest risk loans is performed quarterly 
management follows the progress of the economy and how it might affect old national s borrowers in both the near and the intermediate term 
old national has a formalized and disciplined independent loan review program to evaluate loan administration  credit quality and compliance with corporate loan standards 
this program includes periodic reviews conducted at the community bank locations as well as regular reviews of problem loan reports  delinquencies and charge offs 
old national uses migration analysis as a tool to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for non retail loans that are not impaired 
migration analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to estimate probable losses for existing pools of loans by matching actual losses incurred on loans back to their origination 
the migration derived historical commercial loan loss rates are applied to the current commercial loan pools to arrive at an estimate of probable losses for the loans existing at the time of analysis 
old national calculates migration analysis using several different scenarios based on varying assumptions to evaluate the widest range of possible outcomes 
the amounts determined by migration analysis are adjusted for management s best estimate of the effects of current economic conditions  loan quality trends  results from internal and external review examinations  loan volume trends  credit concentrations and various other factors 
historic loss ratios adjusted for expectations of future economic conditions are used in determining the appropriate level of reserves for consumer and residential real estate loans 
management s analysis of probable losses inherent in the portfolio at december   resulted in a range for allowance for loan losses of million with the potential effect to net income ranging from a decrease of million to an increase of million 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and are not intended to represent actual results 
goodwill and intangibles 
for acquisitions  old national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives for which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived assets recorded must be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis if events or changes indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset with subsequent reversal of the impairment loss being prohibited 
the determination of fair values is based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
changes in these factors  as well as downturns in economic or business conditions  could have a significant adverse impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangible assets and could result in impairment losses affecting the financials of the company as a whole and the individual lines of business in which the goodwill or intangibles reside 

table of contents derivative financial instruments 
as part of the company s overall interest rate risk management  old national uses derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in interest rates and market prices for financial instruments 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings and measurement of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and hedged items 
to the extent hedging relationships are found to be effective  as determined by sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  changes in fair value of the derivatives are significantly offset by changes in the fair value of the related hedged item or recorded to other comprehensive income 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the company no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment  all changes in fair value of the derivative would flow through the consolidated statements of income in other noninterest income  resulting in greater volatility in our earnings 
management believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in preparation of the financial statements 
all of the derivative financial instruments used by the company have active markets and indications of fair value can be readily obtained 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management inherent in old national s balance sheet is market risk  defined as the sensitivity of income  fair market values and capital to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
the primary market risk to which old national has exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises because assets and liabilities may reprice  mature or prepay at different times or based upon different market instruments as market interest rates change 
changes in the slope of the yield curve and the pace of interest rate changes may also impact net interest income and the fair value of the balance sheet 
old national manages interest rate risk within an overall asset and liability management framework that includes attention to credit risk  liquidity risk and capitalization 
a principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
asset and liability management activity is governed by a policy reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors has delegated the administration of this policy to the funds management committee  a committee of the board of directors  and the executive balance sheet management committee  a committee comprised of senior executive management 
the funds management committee meets quarterly and oversees adherence to policy and recommends policy changes to the board 
the executive balance sheet management committee meets quarterly 
this committee determines balance sheet management strategies and initiatives for the company 
a group comprised of corporate and line management meets monthly to implement strategies and initiatives determined by the executive balance sheet management committee 
old national uses two modeling techniques to quantify the impact of changing interest rates on the company  net interest income at risk and economic value of equity 
net interest income at risk is used by management and the board of directors to evaluate the impact of changing rates over a two year horizon 
net interest income at risk includes earnings at risk associated with fair value  cash flow  and stand alone derivatives 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative instruments 
economic value of equity is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
these models simulate the likely behavior of the company s net interest income and the likely change in the company s economic value due to changes in interest rates under various possible interest rate scenarios 
because the models are driven by expected behavior in various interest rate scenarios and many factors besides market interest rates affect the company s net interest income and value  old national recognizes that model outputs are not guarantees of actual results 
for this reason  old national models many different combinations of interest rates and balance sheet assumptions to best understand its overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes 
old national s board of directors  through its funds management committee  monitors the company s interest rate risk 
on january   the funds management committee approved new policy guidelines for the allowable change in net interest income at risk and economic value of equity to enhance the monitoring of compliance within identified interest rate risk exposure zones 

table of contents policy guidelines  in addition to december  and results  are as follows net interest income month policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down up up up green zone yellow zone red zone net interest income month cumulative policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down up up up green zone yellow zone red zone economic value of equity policies interest rate change in basis points bp down down up up up green zone yellow zone red zone red zone policy limits represent old national s absolute interest rate risk exposure compliance limit 
policy limits defined as green zone represent the range of potential interest rate risk exposures that the funds management committee believes to be normal and acceptable operating behavior 
yellow zone policy limits represent a range of interest rate risk exposures falling below the bank s maximum allowable exposure red zone but above its normally acceptable interest rate risk levels green zone 
at december   modeling indicated old national was within the yellow zone policy limits for the up and up month net interest income at risk scenarios 
in addition  modeling indicated old national was within the yellow zone policy limits for the up  up and up month cumulative net interest income at risk scenarios 
old national s management is taking steps to reduce its exposure to rising interest rates 
all other net interest income at risk modeling scenarios fell within old national s green zone  which is considered the normal and acceptable interest rate risk level 
at december   modeling indicated old national was within the yellow zone policy limit for the down economic value of equity scenario 
management has deemed this scenario as an acceptable risk given the company s outlook for interest rates 
all other modeling scenarios fell within old national s green zone  which is considered the normal and acceptable interest rate risk level 

table of contents at december   a notable change in the company s rate risk profile was reflected in the decrease in the company s estimated change in economic value of equity resulting in the down basis points yield curve shock 
economic value of equity changed from at december   to at december  the company reduced its long term exposure to falling interest rates as a result of the sale of its mortgage servicing rights  the decline in certificates of deposit and the increase in interest bearing transaction accounts 
old national uses derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  as one method to manage interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
the company s derivatives had an estimated fair value loss of million at december   compared to an estimated fair value loss of million at december  the decrease in market value is due both to the increase in short term interest rates and the resulting decline in market value of the receive fixed interest rate swaps for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  in addition  the notional amount of derivatives decreased by million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative financial instruments 
on january   the funds management committee approved new policy guidelines for the allowable change in net interest income at risk and the change in economic value of equity to enhance the monitoring of compliance within identified interest rate risk exposure zones 
red zone policy limits represent old national s absolute interest rate risk exposure compliance limit 
policy limits defined as green zone represent the range of potential interest rate risk exposures that the funds management committee believes to be normal and acceptable operating behavior 
yellow zone policy limits represent a range of interest rate risk exposures falling below the bank s maximum allowable exposure red zone but above its normally acceptable interest rate risk levels green zone 
the new policy guidelines became effective for liquidity management the funds management committee of the board of directors establishes liquidity risk guidelines and  along with the balance sheet management committee  monitors liquidity risk 
the objective of liquidity management is to ensure old national has the ability to fund balance sheet growth and meet deposit and debt obligations in a timely and cost effective manner 
management monitors liquidity through a regular review of asset and liability maturities  funding sources  and loan and deposit forecasts 
the company maintains strategic and contingency liquidity plans to ensure sufficient available funding to satisfy requirements for balance sheet growth  properly manage capital markets funding sources and to address unexpected liquidity requirements 
old national s ability to raise funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies views of the company s credit quality  liquidity  capital and earnings 
all four rating agencies have issued a stable outlook in conjunction with their ratings as of december  the senior debt ratings of old national bancorp and old national bank at december   are shown in the following table
