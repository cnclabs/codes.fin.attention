item a  risk factors our business is subject to significant risks 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this form k  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider immaterial may also affect our business operations and financial performance 
if any of the events described below actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way 
this could cause the trading price of our stock to decline  perhaps significantly  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
poor economic conditions affect consumer spending and may significantly harm our business 
the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the level of consumer spending 
a number of factors may affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer  including  among other things general economic  industry and weather conditions  energy costs  which affect gasoline and home heating prices  the level of consumer debt  interest rates  tax rates and policies  war  terrorism and other hostilities  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in consumer demand for discretionary items could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the merchandise we sell generally consists of discretionary items 
reduced consumer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for our discretionary items and may force us to take inventory markdowns 
reduced demand may also require increased selling and promotional expenses 

table of contents our business involves a degree of fashion risk 
certain of our businesses serve a fashion conscious customer base and depend upon the ability of our buyers and merchandisers to predict or detect fashion trends  to purchase inventory that reflects such trends  and to manage our inventories appropriately in view of the potential for sudden changes in fashion or in consumer taste 
failure to continue to execute any of these activities successfully could result in adverse consequences  including lower sales  product margins  operating income and cash flows 
our business and results of operations are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of world events 
our business and results of operations are subject to uncertainties arising out of world events  which may impact not only consumer demand  but also our ability to obtain the products we sell  most of which are produced outside the united states 
these uncertainties may include a global economy slowdown  changes in consumer spending or travel  the increase in gasoline and natural gas prices  the outbreak of illnesses such as bird flu  and the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities 
any future events arising as a result of terrorist activity or other world events may have a material impact on our business  including the demand for and our ability to source products  and consequently on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business is intensely competitive and increased or new competition could have a material adverse effect on us 
the retail footwear  headwear and accessories markets are intensely competitive 
we currently compete against a diverse group of retailers  including other regional and national specialty stores  department and discount stores  small independents and e commerce retailers  which sell products similar to and often identical to those we sell 
our branded businesses  selling footwear at wholesale  also face intense competition  both from other branded wholesale vendors and from private label initiatives of their retailer customers 
a number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  including increased operational efficiencies of competitors  competitive pricing strategies  expansion by existing competitors  entry by new competitors into markets in which we currently operate  and adoption by existing retail competitors of innovative store formats or sales methods 
hat world demand is partly dependent on developments in team sports 
hat world s sales have historically been affected by developments in team sports  and could be adversely impacted by player strikes or other season interruptions  as well as by the performance and reputation of certain key teams 
we are dependent on third party vendors for the merchandise we sell 
we do not manufacture any of the merchandise we sell 
this means that our product supply is subject to the ability and willingness of third party suppliers to deliver merchandise we order 
table of contents on time and in the quantities and of the quality we need 
in addition  a material portion of our retail footwear sales consist of products marketed under brands  belonging to unaffiliated vendors  which have fashion significance to our customers 
our core retail hat business is dependent upon products bearing sports and other logos  each generally controlled by a single licensee vendor 
if those vendors were to decide not to deal with us or to limit the availability of their products to us  we could be unable to offer our customers the products they wish to buy and could lose their business to competitors 
an increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported products may significantly decrease our sales and profits 
merchandise originally manufactured and imported from overseas makes up a large proportion of our total inventory 
a disruption in the shipping of our imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those products may significantly decrease our sales and profits 
in addition  if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable  the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet demand 
products from alternative sources may also be of lesser quality or more expensive than those we currently import 
risks associated with our reliance on imported products include disruptions in the shipping and importation of imported products because of factors such as raw material shortages  work stoppages  strikes and political unrest  problems with oceanic shipping  including shipping container shortages  increased customs inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments  economic crises  international disputes and wars  and increases in the cost of purchasing or shipping foreign merchandise resulting from denial by the united states of most favored nation trading status to or the imposition of quotas or other restrictions on import from a foreign country from which we purchase goods  import duties  import quotas and other trade sanctions  and increases in shipping rates 
a significant amount of the inventory we sell is imported from the people s republic of china  which has in the recent past been subject to efforts to deny most favored nation status or to impose restrictions on imports of certain products 
some of the products we buy abroad are priced in foreign currencies and  therefore  we are affected by fluctuating exchange rates 
in the past  we have entered into foreign currency exchange contracts with major financial institutions to hedge these fluctuations 
we might not be able to effectively protect ourselves in the future against currency rate fluctuations  and our financial performance could suffer as a result 
even dollar denominated foreign purchases may be affected by currency fluctuations  as suppliers seek to reflect appreciation in the local currency against the dollar in the price of the products that they provide 
you should read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about our foreign currency exchange rate exposure and hedging activities 

table of contents the operation of the company s business is heavily dependent on its information systems 
we depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business 
the software programs supporting many of our systems were licensed to the company by independent software developers 
the inability of these developers or the company to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 
in addition  costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations 
we also rely heavily on our information technology staff 
if we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area  we may not be able to fulfill our technology initiatives or to provide maintenance on existing systems 
the loss of  or disruption in  one of our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise  could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
each of our operations depends on a single distribution facility 
most of the operation s inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to its distribution center  where the inventory is then processed  sorted and shipped to our stores or to our wholesale customers 
we depend on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process  which depends  in turn  on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of the distribution centers 
although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and well positioned to support our expansion plans  we cannot assure you that we have anticipated all of the changing demands which our expanding operations will impose on our receiving and distribution system  or that events beyond our control  such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events  labor disagreements or shipping problems whether in our own or in our third party vendors or carriers businesses  will not result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores or to our wholesale customers 
we also make changes in our distribution processes from time to time in an effort to improve efficiency  maximize capacity  etc 
we cannot assure that these changes will not result in unanticipated delays or interruptions in distribution 
we depend upon ups for shipment of a significant amount of merchandise 
an interruption in service by ups for any reason could cause temporary disruptions in our business  a loss of sales and profits  and other material adverse effects 
our freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges 
fuel prices and surcharges affect freight cost both on inbound freight from vendors to our distribution centers and outbound freight from our distribution centers to our stores and wholesale customers 
increases in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of goods sold 
we face a number of risks in opening new stores 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to continue to open new stores  both in regional malls  where most of our operational experience lies  and in other venues with which we are less familiar  including lifestyle centers  major city street locations  and tourist destinations 
we increased our net store base by in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  and currently plan to increase our net store base by approximately to  stores in fiscal we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve our expansion goals or that we will 
table of contents be able to continue our history of operating new stores profitably 
further  we cannot assure you that any new store will achieve similar operating results to those of our existing stores or that new stores opened in markets in which we operate will not have a material adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our existing stores 
the success of our planned expansion will be dependent upon numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following our ability to identify suitable markets and individual store sites within those markets  the competition for suitable store sites  our ability to negotiate favorable lease terms with landlords  our ability to obtain governmental and other third party consents  permits and licenses needed to construct and operate our stores  the availability of employees to staff new stores and our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain store personnel  the availability of adequate management and financial resources to manage an increased number of stores  our ability to adapt our distribution and other operational and management systems to an expanded network of stores  and our ability to attract customers and generate sales sufficient to operate new stores profitably 
additionally  the results we expect to achieve during each fiscal quarter are dependent upon opening new stores on schedule 
if we fall behind  we will lose expected sales and earnings between the planned opening date and the actual opening and may further complicate the logistics of opening stores  possibly resulting in additional delays 
our results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
our business is highly seasonal  with a significant portion of our net sales and operating income generated during the fourth quarter  which includes the holiday shopping season 
because a significant percentage of our net sales and operating income are generated in the fourth quarter  we have limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in fourth quarter sales or earnings by changes in our operations or strategies in other quarters 
a significant shortfall in results for the fourth quarter of any year could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations and on the market price of our stock 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate significantly based on such factors as the timing of new store openings  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the timing of certain holidays and sales events  changes in our merchandise mix  general economic  industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending  and actions of competitors  including promotional activity 

table of contents a failure to increase sales at our existing stores may adversely affect our stock price and impact our results of operations 
a number of factors have historically affected  and will continue to affect  our comparable store sales results  including competition  timing of holidays including sales tax holidays  general regional and national economic conditions  inclement weather such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma that affected the southern us in the fall of  consumer trends  such as less disposable income due the impact of higher gasoline prices  changes in our merchandise mix  our ability to distribute merchandise efficiently to our stores  timing and type of sales events  promotional activities or other advertising  new merchandise introductions  and our ability to execute our business strategy effectively 
our comparable store sales results have fluctuated in the past  and we believe such fluctuations may continue 
the unpredictability of our comparable store sales may cause our revenue and results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter  and an unanticipated decline in revenues or operating income may cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly 
we are subject to regulatory proceedings and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are parties to certain lawsuits and regulatory proceedings  including those disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if these or similar matters are resolved against us  our results of operations or our financial condition could be adversely affected 
moreover  with retail operations in states  puerto rico  the us virgin islands and canada  we are subject to federal  state  provincial  territorial and local regulations which impose costs and risks on our business 
changes in regulations could make compliance more difficult and costly and inadvertent violations could result in liability for damages or penalties 
if we lose key members of management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
our performance depends largely on the efforts and abilities of members of our management team 
our executives have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success 
the unexpected future loss of services of one or more key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  future performance will depend upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees  including store personnel and field management  to keep pace with our expansion schedule 
if we are unable to do so  our ability to meet our growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised 
finally  our stores are decentralized  are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel and historically experience a high degree of turnover 
if we are for any reason 
table of contents unable to maintain appropriate controls on store operations  including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory and cash shrinkage  our sales and operating margins may be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel we need in the future 
any acquisitions we make involve a degree of risk 
we have in the past  and may in the future  engage in acquisitions to grow our revenues and meet our other strategic objectives 
if any future acquisitions are not successfully integrated with our business  our ongoing operations could be adversely affected 
additionally  acquisitions may not achieve desired profitability objectives or result in any anticipated successful expansion of the acquired businesses or concepts 
although we review and analyze assets or companies we acquire  such reviews are subject to uncertainties and may not reveal all potential risks 
additionally  although we attempt to obtain protective contractual provisions  such as representations  warranties and indemnities  in connection with acquisitions  we cannot assure you that we can obtain such provisions in our acquisitions or that they will fully protect us from unforeseen costs of the acquisitions 
we may also incur significant costs in connection with pursuing possible acquisitions even if the acquisition is not ultimately consummated

item  legal proceedings environmental matters new york state environmental matters in august  the new york state department of environmental conservation the department and the company entered into a consent order whereby the company assumed responsibility for conducting a remedial investigation and feasibility study rifs and implementing an interim remediation measure irm with regard to the site of a knitting mill operated by a former subsidiary of the company from to the company undertook the irm and rifs voluntarily  without admitting liability or accepting responsibility for any future remediation of the site 
the company estimates that the cost of conducting the rifs and implementing the irm will be in the range of million to million  net of insurance recoveries  million of which the company has already paid 
in the course of preparing the rifs  the company has identified remedial alternatives with estimated undiscounted costs ranging from to million  excluding amounts previously expended or provided for by the company  as described in this footnote 
the company has not ascertained what responsibility  if any  it has for any contamination in connection with the facility or what other parties may be liable in that connection and is unable to predict the extent of its liability  if any  beyond that voluntarily assumed by the consent order 
the company s voluntary assumption of certain responsibility to date was based upon its judgment that such action was preferable to litigation to determine its liability  if any  for contamination related to the site 
the company intends to continue to evaluate the costs of further voluntary remediation versus the costs and uncertainty of litigation 

table of contents as part of its analysis of whether to undertake further voluntary action  the company has assessed various methods of preventing potential future impact of contamination from the site on two public wells that are in the expected future path of the groundwater plume from the site 
the village of garden city has proposed the installation at the supply wells of enhanced treatment measures at an estimated cost of approximately million  with estimated future costs of up to million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company provided for the estimated cost of a remedial alternative it considers adequate to prevent such impact and which it would be willing to implement voluntarily 
the village of garden city has also asserted that the company is liable for historical costs of treatment at the wells totaling approximately million 
because of evidence with regard to when contaminants from the site of the company s former operations first reached the wells  the company believes it should have no liability with respect to such historical costs 
whitehall environmental matters the company has performed sampling and analysis of soil  sediments  surface water  groundwater and waste management areas at the company s former volunteer leather company facility in whitehall  michigan 
the company has submitted to the michigan department of environmental quality mdeq and provided for certain costs associated with a remedial action plan the plan designed to bring the property into compliance with regulatory standards for non industrial uses 
the company estimates that the costs of resolving environmental contingencies related to the whitehall property range from million to million  and considers the cost of implementing the plan to be the most likely cost within that range 
while management believes that the plan should be sufficient to satisfy applicable regulatory standards with respect to the site  until the plan is finally approved by mdeq  management cannot provide assurances that no further remediation will be required or that its estimate of the range of possible costs or of the most likely cost of remediation will prove accurate 
in december  the us environmental protection agency epa notified the company that it considers the company a potentially responsible party prp with respect to contamination at two superfund sites in new york state 
the sites were used as landfills for process wastes generated by a glue manufacturer  which acquired tannery wastes from several tanners  allegedly including the company s whitehall tannery  for use as raw materials in the gluemaking process 
the company has no records indicating that it ever provided raw materials to the gluemaking operation and has not been able to establish whether epa s substantive allegations are accurate 
the company has joined a joint defense group with other tannery prp s with respect to one of the two sites 
the joint defense group has developed an estimated cost of remediation for the site and proposed an allocation of liabilities among the prp s that  if accepted  is estimated to result in liability to the company of approximately  with respect to the site 
there is no assurance that the proposed allocation will be accepted or that the actual cost of remediation will not exceed the estimate 
additionally  the company presently cannot estimate its liability  if any  with respect to the second site associated with the glue manufacturer s waste disposal 
related to all outstanding environmental contingencies  the company had accrued million as of january   million as of january  and million as of january  all such provisions reflect the company s estimates of the most likely cost undiscounted  including both current and noncurrent portions of resolving the contingencies  based on facts and 
table of contents circumstances as of the time they were made 
there is no assurance that relevant facts and circumstances will not change  necessitating future changes to the provisions 
such contingent liabilities are included in the liability arising from provision for discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
insurance matter in may  the company filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the middle district of tennessee against former general liability insurance carriers that underwrote policies covering the company during periods relevant to the new york state knitting mill matter described above and the matters described above under the caption whitehall environmental matters 
the action sought a determination that the carriers defense and indemnity obligations under the policies extend to the sites 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company and the carriers reached definitive settlement agreements and the company received cash payments from the carriers totaling approximately million in exchange for releases from liability with respect to the two sites 
net of the insurance proceeds  additional pretax provisions totaling approximately million for future remediation expenses associated with the new york state knitting mill matter described above and the whitehall matter described above  are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations for fiscal other matters patent action in january  the company was named a defendant in an action filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania  schoenhaus  et al 
vs 
genesco inc  et al  alleging that certain features of shoes in the company s johnston murphy line infringe the plaintiff s patent  misappropriate trade secrets and involve conversion of the plaintiff s proprietary information and unjust enrichment of the company 
on january   the court granted summary judgment to the company on the patent claims  finding that the accused products do not infringe the plaintiff s patent 
the plaintiffs appealed the summary judgment to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit  pending which the trial court stayed the remainder of the case 
on march   the court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment in the company s favor 
california employment matters on october   the company was named a defendant in a putative class action filed in the superior court of the state of california  los angeles  schreiner vs 
genesco inc  et al  alleging violations of california wages and hours laws  and seeking damages of million plus punitive damages 
on may   the company and the plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to settle the action  subject to court approval and other conditions 
in connection with the proposed settlement  to provide for the settlement payment to the plaintiff class and related expenses  the company recognized a charge of million before taxes included in restructuring and other  net in the consolidated statements of earnings for the first three months of fiscal on may   a second putative class action  drake vs 
genesco inc  et al  making allegations similar to those in the schreiner complaint on behalf of employees of the company s johnston murphy division  was filed by a different plaintiff in the california superior court  los angeles 
on november   the schreiner court granted final approval of the settlement and the company and the drake plaintiff reached an agreement on november  to settle that action 
the two matters were resolved more favorably to the company than originally expected  as not all members of the plaintiff class in schreiner submitted claims and because the court required that plaintiff s counsel bear the administrative expenses of the settlement 
consequently  
table of contents the company recognized income of million before tax  reflected in restructuring and other  net  in the consolidated statements of earnings for the third quarter of fiscal on november   a former employee gave notice to the california labor work force development agency lwda of a claim against genesco for allegedly failing to provide a payroll check that is negotiable and payable in cash  on demand  without discount  at an established place of business in california  as required by the california labor code

our future results are subject to various risks  uncertainties and other challenges  including those discussed in item a  risk factors  above 
generally  the company attempts to develop strategies to mitigate all the risks it views as material  including those discussed in item a  risk factors 
among the most important of these factors are those related to consumer demand 
conditions in the external economy can affect demand  resulting in changes in sales and  as prices are adjusted to drive sales and control inventories  in gross margins 
because fashion trends influencing many of the company s target customers particularly customers of journeys  underground station and hat world can change rapidly  the company believes that its ability to detect and respond quickly to those changes has been important to its success 
even when the company succeeds in aligning its merchandise offerings with consumer preferences  those preferences may affect results by  for example  driving sales of products with lower average selling prices 
the company believes its experience and discipline in merchandising and the buying power associated with its relative size in the industry are important to its ability to mitigate risks associated with changing customer preferences 
also important to the

summary of operating results the company s net sales increased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase was driven primarily by a increase in comparable store sales for all footwear concepts and the addition of new stores and the inclusion of hat world for a full twelve months 
comparable store sales for hat world increased for fiscal gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during fiscal primarily due to improved gross margins in the journeys  underground station  hat world and johnston murphy businesses 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales during fiscal due to increased expenses in the journeys  hat world and licensed brands businesses

critical accounting policies inventory valuation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in its wholesale operations  cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
market is determined using a system of analysis which evaluates inventory at the stock number level based on factors such as inventory turn  average selling price  inventory level  and selling prices reflected in future orders 
the company provides reserves when the inventory has not been marked down to market based on current selling prices or when the inventory is not turning and is not expected to turn at levels satisfactory to the company 
in its retail operations  other than the hat world segment  the company employs the retail inventory method  applying average cost to retail ratios to the retail value of inventories 
under the retail inventory method  valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market is achieved as markdowns are taken or accrued as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method are subjective judgments and estimates including merchandise mark on  markups  markdowns  and shrinkage 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  could produce a range of cost figures 
to reduce the risk of inaccuracy and to ensure consistent presentation  the company employs the retail inventory method in multiple subclasses of inventory with similar gross margin  and analyzes markdown requirements at the stock number level based on factors such as inventory turn  average selling price  and inventory age 
in addition  the company accrues markdowns as necessary 
these additional markdown accruals reflect all of the above factors as well as current agreements to return products to vendors and vendor agreements to provide markdown support 
in addition to markdown provisions  the company maintains provisions for shrinkage and damaged goods based on historical rates 
a change of percent from the recorded amounts for all such provisions would have changed inventory by million at january  the hat world segment employs the moving average cost method for valuing inventories and applies freight using an allocation method 
the company provides a valuation allowance for slow moving inventory based on negative margins and estimated shrink based on historical experience and specific analysis  where appropriate 

table of contents inherent in the analysis of both wholesale and retail inventory valuation are subjective judgments about current market conditions  fashion trends  and overall economic conditions 
failure to make appropriate conclusions regarding these factors may result in an overstatement or understatement of inventory value 
impairment of long term assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company periodically assesses the realizability of its long lived assets and evaluates such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
asset impairment is determined to exist if estimated future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  are less than the carrying amount 
inherent in the analysis of impairment are subjective judgments about future cash flows 
failure to make appropriate conclusions regarding these judgments may result in an overstatement of the value of long lived assets 
environmental and other contingencies the company is subject to certain loss contingencies related to environmental proceedings and other legal matters  including those disclosed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company has made provisions for certain of these contingencies  including approximately million reflected in fiscal  million reflected in fiscal and million reflected in fiscal the company monitors these matters on an ongoing basis and  on a quarterly basis  management reviews the company s reserves and accruals in relation to each of them  adjusting provisions as management deems necessary in view of changes in available information 
changes in estimates of liability are reported in the periods when they occur 
consequently  management believes that its reserve in relation to each proceeding is a best estimate of probable loss connected to the proceeding  or in cases in which no best estimate is possible  the minimum amount in the range of estimated losses  based upon its analysis of the facts and circumstances as of the close of the most recent fiscal quarter 
however  because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation generally and in environmental proceedings in particular  there can be no assurance that future developments will not require additional reserves to be set aside  that some or all reserves will be adequate or that the amounts of any such additional reserves or any such inadequacy will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition retail sales are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated returns 
catalog and internet sales are recorded at time of delivery to the customer and are net of estimated returns 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimated returns and allowances for markdowns  damages and miscellaneous claims when the related goods have been shipped and legal title has passed to the customer 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales 
estimated returns are based on historical returns and claims 
actual amounts of markdowns have not differed materially from estimates 
actual returns and claims in any future period may differ from historical experience 
pension plan accounting the company accounts for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual 
table of contents basis over employees approximate service periods 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate  as well as the recognition of actuarial gains and losses 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
long term rate of return assumption pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
the company estimates that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
to develop this assumption  the company considered historical asset returns  the current asset allocation and future expectations of asset returns 
considering this information and the potential for lower future returns  the company selected an long term rate of return on assets assumption 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a long term investment policy of us equities  international equities  us fixed income securities and cash equivalents 
for fiscal  if the expected rate of return had been decreased by  net pension expense would have increased by million  and if the expected rate of return had been increased by  net pension expense would have decreased by million 
discount rate pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the company discounted future pension obligations using a rate of   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the discount rate is determined based on the current yields on high quality long term bonds 
for fiscal  if the discount rate had been increased by  net pension expense would have decreased by million  and if the discount rate had been decreased by  net pension expense would have increased by million 
in addition  if the discount rate had been increased by  the projected benefit obligation would have decreased by million and the accumulated benefit obligation would have decreased by million 
if the discount rate had been decreased by  the projected benefit obligation would have been increased by million and the accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by million 
amortization of gains and losses the significant declines experienced in the financial markets have unfavorably impacted pension asset performance 
the company utilizes a calculated value of assets  which is an averaging method that recognizes changes in the fair values of assets over a period of five years 
at the end of fiscal  the company had unrecognized actuarial losses of million 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that the company recognize a portion of these losses when they exceed a calculated threshold 
these losses might be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years and would be amortized over the average future service of employees  which is currently seven years 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact future pension expense and liabilities  including increasing or decreasing unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
the company recognized expense for its defined benefit pension plans of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s board of directors approved freezing the company s defined pension benefit plan effective january  the company s pension expense is expected to decrease in fiscal by approximately million due to the net effect of a reduction in the discount rate from to and a higher than expected return on assets

changes in estimates of liability are reported in the periods when they occur 
consequently  management believes that its reserve in relation to each proceeding is a reasonable estimate of the probable loss connected to the proceeding  or in cases in which no reasonable estimate is possible  the minimum amount in the range of estimated losses  based upon its analysis of the facts and circumstances as of the close of the most recent fiscal quarter 
however  because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation generally and in environmental proceedings in particular  there can be no assurance that future developments will not require additional reserves to be set aside  that some or all reserves may not be adequate or that the amounts of any such additional reserves or any such inadequacy will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial condition or results of operations 
financial market risk the following discusses the company s exposure to financial market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
outstanding debt of the company the company s outstanding long term debt of million convertible subordinated debentures due june  bears interest at a fixed rate 
the million outstanding under the term loan bears interest according to a pricing grid providing margins over libor or the alternate base rate 
the company entered into three separate interest rate swap agreements as a means of managing its interest rate exposure on the original term loan 
the notional amount of the one remaining interest rate swap agreement is million 
accordingly  there would be no immediate impact on the company s interest expense due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
at january   the net gain on this interest rate swap agreement was million 
cash and cash equivalents the company s cash and cash equivalent balances are invested in financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at january  as a result  the company considers the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at january  to be low 
foreign currency exchange rate risk most purchases by the company from foreign sources are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that import transactions are denominated in other currencies  it is the company s practice to hedge its risks through the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts 
at january   the company had million of forward foreign 
table of contents exchange contracts for euro 
the company s policy is not to speculate in derivative instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation and it does not hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
derivative instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract 
the unrealized gain on contracts outstanding at january  was  based on current spot rates 
as of january   a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts by approximately million 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable balance at january  is concentrated in its two wholesale businesses  which sell primarily to department stores and independent retailers across the united states 
one customer accounted for of the company s trade accounts receivable balance and another customer accounted for as of january  the company monitors the credit quality of its customers and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding credit risk  historical trends and other information  however  credit risk is affected by conditions or occurrences within the economy and the retail industry  as well as company specific information 
summary based on the company s overall market interest rate and foreign currency rate exposure at january   the company believes that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal would not be material 
however  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal new accounting principles in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statements of earnings based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
the company s board of directors has amended the company s employee stock purchase plan to provide that participants may acquire shares under the plan at a discount from fair market value on the last day of the plan year 
under sfas no 
r  shares issued under the plan as amended are non compensatory and compensation expense related thereto is not required to be reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings 
sfas no 
r is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  fiscal for the company 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share 
table of contents based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures of all prior periods presented 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net earnings and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma amounts were calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years 
based upon research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use a black scholes model for option valuation 
sfas no 
r includes several modifications to the presentation of income taxes in the financial statements 
the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in the company s effective tax rates recorded throughout the year 
sfas no 
r does not allow companies to predict when these taxable events will take place 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company will utilize the modified prospective method of adoption for sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  the market value of the company s common stock  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables such as the company s stock price variability and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s stock based compensation plans 
in november the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
clarifies that inventory costs that are abnormal are required to be charged to expense as incurred as opposed to being capitalized into inventory as a product cost 
sfas no 
provides examples of abnormal costs to include costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on the 
table of contents company s results of operations or financial position 
in march the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin became effective for the company in fiscal and did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
