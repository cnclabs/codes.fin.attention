fiscal years and were week periods  and fiscal year was a week period 
net revenues increased for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the fiscal year ended october  during fiscal year  increased sales in the retail and foodservice categories offset the decline in airline sales 
we expect future sales growth to be driven primarily by the retail and foodservice areas 
we experienced a increase in net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to the fiscal year ended september  the increase in net revenues during fiscal year was due to growth in all business categories 
our gross profit increased during fiscal year and during fiscal year operating income increased for the fiscal year ended october  and for the fiscal year ended october  due to increases in sales  manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a 
cost of sales declined as a percentage of net revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year sg a as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year and in fiscal year as described under the liquidity and capital resources heading below  during fiscal year we refinanced our existing debt of million 
the new credit facility with guggenheim corporate funding  llc gcf is a million senior secured credit facility with a five year maturity and is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
the facility is structured as a million non amortizing revolving loan  a million amortizing tranche a term loan and a million non amortizing tranche b term loan 
results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our results of operations from one period to another  present the results for each period  the change in those results from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each period as a percentage of net revenues 
the columns present the following o first two data columns in each table show the absolute results for each period presented 
o columns entitled dollar variance and percentage variance show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positives and unfavorable changes as negatives 
for example  when our net revenues increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a negative in both columns

net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended october  retail net revenues increased  to  for the fiscal year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in retail sales was largely due to a increase in sales to jenny craig and to sales generated by two new customers added in the fiscal year ended october  these sales increases more than offset lost revenues from discontinued product lines and lower sales to some retail customers 
foodservice net revenues increased  to  for the fiscal year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  due to increased sales to an existing customer  partially offset by decreased revenue from the loss of a product for an existing foodservice customer 
airline net revenues decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  the decline in airline sales was primarily attributable to american airlines decision in february to remove meals from the coach cabins of all of its domestic flights and partly attributable to significantly reduced sales to delta airlines subsequent to their bankruptcy filing 
year over year comparisons will reflect the loss of sales to delta airlines through the first quarter of fiscal year panda restaurant group  inc panda has added a third supplier of the products we sell to panda and has indicated it plans to spread its orders for calendar year among the three suppliers in order to diversify its sources of supply as it continues to expand 
we expect foodservice sales for fiscal year to decline when panda reallocates approximately million of previously anticipated orders from us to the other panda suppliers 
we expect this reallocation and sales decline will occur early in the second quarter of fiscal year however  we believe that our relationship with panda remains strong  and we expect to participate in its future growth 
we expect that this anticipated decline in foodservice sales will be offset in fiscal year by sales to new retail customers 
anticipated sales to our largest prospective retail customer are not expected to begin until late in the second quarter of fiscal year we are now in contract negotiations with this prospective customer and have scheduled test runs of several of their products for december we believe airline meals will continue to be a profitable part of our overall business despite the financial and business challenges facing the airline industry 
gross profit 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended october  increased  to  from  for the fiscal year ended october  the majority of this increase is attributable to net revenues increasing  the balance of the increase was the result of improvement in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended october  margin improvement was attributable to better operating leverage resulting from higher sales volume and better pricing of raw materials 
we modified our estimate for recording inventory reserves during the first quarter of fiscal year to apply estimated reserve percentages to aging categories 
the impact of this change in estimate resulted in a one time increase to cost of sales and decrease in gross profit of approximately  or a decline in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses decreased  to  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  from  of net revenues for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease in sg a expenses resulted from a  reduction in professional  legal and consulting fees  a  decline in brokerage and royalty expenses due to reduced club store sales and a reduction of  in corporate expenses 
in addition  bad debt expense was reduced in the current year as no additional allowances were added to the reserve for doubtful accounts as compared to the addition of  in the prior year 
these reductions were partially offset by increases of  in sales promotional activities and increases of  and  in payroll and insurance costs  respectively 
the fact that fiscal year was one week shorter than fiscal year also contributed to the decline in sg a expenses 
as a result of the refinancing described under the liquidity and capital resources heading below  we have begun to experience savings of  in annual consulting fees that we had been paying to levine leichtman capital partners ii  lp llcp

a total reduction in annual interest expense of approximately  is anticipated during the first twelve months of our new credit agreement 
these anticipated savings may not be fully realized if there are future increases in market interest rates or if we fail to meet our financial and other covenants under our secured credit facility

the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended october  did not materially differ from the statutory rate 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate for the fiscal year ended october  was the result of the reversal of the valuation reserve of  that was established in fiscal year during the fiscal year ended october   as a result of improved operating results  we concluded that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we reversed  of the previously recorded valuation allowance against a portion of our deferred tax assets 
net income 
net income for the fiscal year ended october  was  or per basic share and per diluted share as compared to net income of  or per basic share and per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october  we currently expect to continue profitable operations primarily through a growing revenues from profitable product lines and increasing our customer base  b improving gross margins by streamlining additional costs and continuing to leverage the manufacturing and storage facilities to improve manufacturing efficiency  and c reducing future interest costs on outstanding debt through permitted pre payments on our debt 
however  no assurance can be given that we will be successful

airline net revenues were  for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended september   an increase of

we are in the process of evaluating our cooking capacity 
if we deem additional cooking capacity to be necessary  estimated capital expenditures for that capacity could range from million to million during fiscal years and  depending on the amount of additional cooking capacity added  if any 
we anticipate that cash generated from operating activities and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities will fund capital expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended october   our financing activities resulted in a use of cash of  as compared to a use of cash of  during the fiscal year ended october  the use of cash during the fiscal year ended october  consisted primarily of  of principal payments that reduced our outstanding debt 
the principal payments consisted of  under our previous financing arrangements   under our new facility and  to retire other previously outstanding debt

under the credit agreement  gcf acts as collateral agent  administrative agent  arranger and syndication agent in connection with loans made by various lenders  including affiliates of gcf 
the facility with gcf is a million senior secured credit facility with a five year maturity  maturing in may  and is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
the facility is structured as a million non amortizing revolving loan  a million amortizing tranche a term loan and a million non amortizing tranche b term loan 
the facility bears interest  adjustable quarterly  at libor plus the applicable margin listed below for libor loans or  at our option in the case of the revolving loans  an alternate base rate equal to the greater of the prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus  plus an applicable margin  as follows applicable margin for total debt to alternate base applicable margin for ebitda ratio rate loans libor loans for last twelve tranche a tranche b months revolving loan revolving loan term loan term loan greater than greater than or equal to but less than or equal to less than initial funding under the gcf credit facility was made on may  in the amount of million through the issuance of tranche a term loans in the principal amount of million  tranche b term loans in the principal amount of million and libor revolving loans in the principal amount of million

at october   interest rates on the tranche a term loans  tranche b term loans and libor revolving loans were  and  respectively 
initial proceeds from the gcf facility were used to repay approximately million in existing debt and related fees and expenses of llcp and psi in connection with the termination of our financing arrangements with them comprising a secured senior subordinated note payable to llcp and a senior term a note payable to psi and to pay approximately million in fees and expenses relating to the new financing 
of these fees  million is recorded as debt discount  net of accumulated amortization  on the accompanying balance sheet as of october  we recorded a pretax charge of approximately  in connection with the termination of the llcp and psi financing arrangements in the third quarter of fiscal year the gcf facility contains covenants whereby  among other things  we are required to maintain compliance with agreed levels of ebitda  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  leverage targets  and annual capital expenditures and incremental indebtedness limits

on september   we entered into a year loan in the principal amount of  at a fixed interest rate of to finance the purchase of machinery used for manufacturing processes 
as of october   we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of the agreement with gcf 
we believe it is probable that we will remain in compliance with all of those covenant requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  if we fail to achieve certain revenue  expense and profitability levels  a violation of the financial covenants under our financing arrangements could result and interest rate increases and acceleration of maturity of the loans could occur  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that funds available to us from operations and existing capital resources will be adequate for our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are related to its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk 
our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally require no collateral from our customers 
a bankruptcy or other significant financial deterioration of any customers could impact their future ability to satisfy their receivables with us 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based primarily upon historical bad debt experience and current market conditions 
until fiscal  bad debt expense and accounts receivable write offs  net of recoveries  were immaterial as we generally transact the substantial portion of our business with large  established food or service related businesses 
for the fiscal years ended october   october  and september   our write offs  net of recoveries  to the allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total net revenues during the last two fiscal years was derived from two customers 
panda restaurant group  inc and jenny craig  inc accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended october  and approximately and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at october  panda restaurant group  inc and jenny craig  inc 
accounted for approximately and respectively  of our revenues for the fiscal year ended october  and approximately and  respectively  of our total accounts receivable balance at october  inventories 
inventories  which include material  labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been materially consistent with actual costs 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation reserve based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a reserve is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the reserve is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in material increases or decreases to the reserve 
during the quarter ended january   we revised our method to apply reserve estimation percentages to aging categories 
the effect of this change in estimate resulted in one time higher cost of sales and lower gross profit of approximately  and lowered net income by approximately  for the three months ended january  excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired 
we evaluate the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we have one reporting unit and estimate fair value based on a variety of market factors  including discounted cash flow analysis  market capitalization  and other market based data 
at october   we had goodwill of million 
a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect could decrease the estimated fair value of our business and  thus  cause our goodwill to become impaired and cause us to record a charge against operations in an amount representing the impairment 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that all deferred tax assets will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a charge to income  at that time
