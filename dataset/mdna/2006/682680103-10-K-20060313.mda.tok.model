index to financial statements regulated businesses kansas gas service uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect kansas gas service customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas 
at december   kansas gas service had derivative instruments in place to hedge the cost of natural gas purchases for bcf  which represents part of their gas purchase requirements for the winter heating months 
gains or losses associated with the kansas gas service hedges are included in and recoverable through the monthly pga 
value at risk var disclosure of market risk we measure market risk in the energy marketing and risk management  trading and non trading portfolios of our non regulated businesses using a var methodology  which estimates the expected maximum loss of the portfolio over a specified time horizon within a given confidence interval 
our var calculations are based on the monte carlo approach 
the quantification of market risk using var provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance  to determine risk targets and set position limits 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation 
inputs to the calculation include prices  volatilities  positions  instrument valuations and the variance covariance matrix 
historical data is used to estimate our var with more weight given to recent data  which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements 
we rely on var to determine the potential reduction in the portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period 
while management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable  no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating var 
different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
our var exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our non regulated businesses energy marketing and risk management  non trading and trading portfolios of derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and natural gas in storage due to adverse market movements 
a one day time horizon and a percent confidence level were used in our var data 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the var calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices  operating exposures and timing thereof  and the changes in our derivative financial instruments  physical contracts and natural gas in storage 
var information should be evaluated in light of these assumptions and the methodology s other limitations 
the potential impact on our future earnings  as measured by the var  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table details the average  high and low var calculations 
years ended december  value at risk millions of dollars average high low the variations in the var data are reflective of market volatility and changes in the portfolios during the year 
the increase in var  compared with  is primarily due to the increase in natural gas prices in the third and fourth quarters of  which mainly resulted from supply disruption caused by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
risk policy and oversight we control the scope of risk management  marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of management 
the audit committee of our board of directors has oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and policies 
our risk oversight committee  comprised of corporate officers  oversees all activities related to commodity price  credit and interest rate risk management  and marketing and trading activities 
the committee also proposes risk metrics including var and dollar loss limits 
we have a corporate risk control organization led by our senior vice president of financial services and treasurer and our vice president of audit and risk control  who are assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies  procedures and limits 
key risk control activities include credit review and approval  credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring  validation of transactions  portfolio valuation  var and other risk metrics 
to the extent open commodity positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result  we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business  operating results or financial position

index to financial statements interest rate and currency risk interest rate risk we are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the normal course of business 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and  at times  interest rate swaps 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates 
at december   the interest rate on percent of our long term debt was fixed after considering the impact of interest rate swaps 
during the first quarter of  we terminated million of our interest rate swap agreements and paid a net amount of million  which included million for the present value of future payments at the time of termination  less million for interest rate savings through the termination of the swaps 
during the first quarter of  we terminated million of our interest rate swap agreements and received million 
the net savings from the termination of these swaps is being recognized in interest expense over the terms of the debt instruments originally hedged 
net interest expense savings for for all terminated swaps was million  and the remaining net savings for all terminated swaps will be recognized over the following periods million million million million million thereafter million currently  million of fixed rate debt is swapped to floating 
the floating rate debt is based on both the three and six month london interbank offered rate libor 
at december   we recorded a net liability of million to recognize the interest rate swaps at fair value 
long term debt was decreased by million to recognize the change in the fair value of the related hedged liability 
see note i 
total swap savings for were million  compared with the savings of million in prior to the issuance of the million of notes in the second quarter of  we entered into million in treasury rate lock agreements to hedge the changes in cash flows of our anticipated interest payments from changes in treasury rates prior to the issuance of the notes 
upon issuance of the notes in june  the treasury rate lock agreements terminated  which resulted in our paying million 
this amount  net of tax  has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be recognized in the income statement over the term of the related debt issuances 
at december   a basis point move in the annual interest rate on all of our outstanding long term debt would change our annual interest expense by million before taxes 
this basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
if interest rates changed significantly  we would take actions to manage our exposure to the change 
since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain  no change has been assumed 
currency rate risk with our energy services segment s expansion into canada  we are subject to currency exposure related to our firm transportation and storage contracts 
our objective with respect to currency risk is to reduce the exposure due to exchange rate fluctuations 
we use physical forward transactions  which result in an actual two way flow of currency on the settlement date since we exchange us dollars for canadian dollars with another party 
we have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment  therefore  the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are recorded in net margin 
at december  and  our exposure to risk from currency translation was not material
