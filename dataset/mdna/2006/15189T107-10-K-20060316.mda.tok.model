executive summary significant events in recovery of true up balance securitization financing the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law  which became effective in september  substantially amended the regulatory structure governing electric utilities in order to allow retail competition for electric customers beginning in january the texas electric restructuring law requires the texas utility commission to conduct a true up proceeding to determine centerpoint houston s stranded costs and certain other costs resulting from the transition to a competitive retail electric market and to provide for its recovery of those costs 
in march  centerpoint houston filed its true up application with the texas utility commission  requesting recovery of billion  excluding interest 
in december  the texas utility commission issued its final order true up order allowing centerpoint houston to recover a true up balance of approximately billion  which included interest through august   and providing for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery  the principal portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after august  and certain other matters 
centerpoint houston and other parties filed appeals of the true up order to a district court in travis county  texas 
in august  the court issued its final judgment on the various appeals 
in its judgment  the court affirmed most aspects of the true up order  but reversed two of the texas utility commission s rulings 
the judgment would have the effect of restoring approximately million  plus interest  of the billion the texas utility commission had disallowed from centerpoint houston s initial request 
first  the court reversed the texas utility commission s decision to prohibit centerpoint houston from recovering million in credits through august that centerpoint houston was ordered to provide to retail electric providers as a result of an inaccurate stranded cost estimate made by the texas utility commission in additional credits of approximately million were paid after august second  the court reversed the texas utility commission s disallowance of million in transition costs which are recoverable under the texas utility commission s regulations 
centerpoint houston and other parties appealed the district court decisions 
briefs have been filed with the rd court of appeals in austin but oral argument has not yet been scheduled 
there are two ways for centerpoint houston to recover the true up balance by issuing transition bonds to securitize the amounts due and or by implementing a competition transition charge ctc 
pursuant to a financing order issued by the texas utility commission in march and affirmed in all respects in august by the same travis county district court considering the appeal of the true up order  in december a subsidiary of centerpoint houston issued billion in transition bonds with interest rates ranging from percent to percent and final maturity dates ranging from february to august through issuance of the transition bonds  centerpoint houston recovered approximately billion of the true up balance determined in the true up order plus interest through the date on which the bonds were issued 
in july  centerpoint houston received an order from the texas utility commission allowing it to implement a ctc which will collect approximately million over years plus interest at an annual rate of percent ctc order 
the ctc order authorizes centerpoint houston to impose a charge on retail electric providers to recover the portion of the true up balance not covered by the financing order 
the ctc order also allows centerpoint houston to collect approximately million of rate case expenses over three years through a separate tariff rider rider rce 
centerpoint houston implemented the ctc and rider rce effective september  and began recovering approximately million 
during the period from september   the date of implementation of the ctc order  through december   centerpoint houston recognized approximately million in ctc operating income 
certain parties appealed the ctc order to the travis county court in september under the true up order  centerpoint houston is allowed to recover carrying charges at percent until the true up balance is recovered 
in january  the texas utility commission staff staff proposed that the texas utility commission adopt new rules governing the carrying charges on unrecovered true up balances 
if the texas utility commission adopts the rule as the staff proposed it and the rule is deemed to apply to centerpoint houston  the rule would reduce carrying costs on the unrecovered ctc balance prospectively from percent to the utility s cost of debt 
centerpoint houston rate case the texas utility commission requires each electric utility to file an annual earnings report providing certain information to enable the texas utility commission to monitor the electric utilities earnings and financial condition within the state 
in may  centerpoint houston filed its earnings report for the calendar year ended december  centerpoint houston s earnings report shows that it earned less than its authorized rate of return on equity in in october  the staff filed a memorandum summarizing its review of the earnings reports filed by electric utilities 
based on its review  the staff concluded that continuation of centerpoint houston s rates could result in excess retail transmission and distribution revenues of as much as million and excess wholesale transmission revenues of as much as million annually and recommended that the texas utility commission initiate a review of the reasonableness of existing rates 
the staff s analysis was based on a percent cost of equity  which is basis points lower than the approved return on equity from centerpoint houston s last rate proceeding  the elimination of interest on debt that matured in november and certain other adjustments to centerpoint houston s reported information 
additionally  a hypothetical capital structure of percent debt and percent equity was used which varies materially from the actual capital structure of centerpoint houston as of december  of approximately percent debt and percent equity 
in december  the texas utility commission considered the staff report and agreed to initiate a rate proceeding concerning the reasonableness of centerpoint houston s existing rates for transmission and distribution service and to require centerpoint houston to make a filing by april  to justify or change those rates 
city of houston franchise in june  centerpoint houston accepted an ordinance granting it a new year franchise to use the public rights of way to conduct its business in the city of houston new franchise ordinance 
the new franchise ordinance took effect on july   and replaced the prior electricity franchise ordinance  which had been in effect since the new franchise ordinance clarifies certain operational obligations of centerpoint houston and the city of houston and provides for streamlined payment and audit procedures and a two year statute of limitations on claims for underpayment or overpayment under the ordinance 
under the prior electricity franchise ordinance  centerpoint houston paid annual franchise fees of million to the city of houston for the year ended december  for the twelve month period beginning july   the annual franchise fee annual franchise fee under the new franchise ordinance will include a base amount of million base amount and an additional payment of million additional amount 
the base amount and the additional amount will be adjusted annually based on the increase  if any  in kwh delivered by centerpoint houston within the city of houston 
centerpoint houston began paying the new annual franchise fees on july  pursuant to the new franchise ordinance  the annual franchise fee will be reduced prospectively to reflect any portion of the annual franchise fee that is not included in centerpoint houston s base rates in any subsequent rate case 
debt financing transactions during the fourth quarter of  centerpoint houston retired at maturity its billion term loan  which bore interest at the london inter bank offer rate libor plus basis points  subject to a minimum libor rate of percent 
centerpoint houston used its billion credit facility bearing interest at libor plus basis points to retire the term loan 
borrowings under the credit facility were subsequently repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the billion transition bonds referred to above 
in august  we accepted for exchange approximately million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due old notes for an equal amount of our new convertible senior notes due new notes 
old notes of approximately million remain outstanding 
we commenced the exchange offer in response to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share eitf 
under that guidance  because settlement of the principal portion of the new notes will be made in cash rather than stock  the exchange of new notes for old notes will allow us to exclude the portion of the conversion value of the new notes attributable to their principal amount from our computation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
sale of texas genco in july  we announced our agreement to sell our majority owned generating subsidiary  texas genco holdings  inc texas genco  to texas genco llc 
on december   texas genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets coal  lignite and gas fired plants to texas genco llc for billion in cash 
following the sale  texas genco  whose principal remaining asset was its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility  distributed billion in cash to us 
the final step of the transaction  the merger of texas genco with a subsidiary of texas genco llc in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of million  was completed on april  the operations of texas genco  formerly presented as our electric generation business segment  are presented as discontinued operations 
highlights our operating performance for compared to was affected by increased operating income of million in our pipelines and field services business segment primarily from increased demand for transportation resulting from basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services and increased throughput and demand for services related to our core gas gathering operations  increased operating income of million in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment primarily from higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control  a decreased operating loss of million in our other operations business segment primarily from increased overhead allocated in  continued customer growth  with the addition of  metered electric and gas customers  a decrease in interest expense of million  and a decrease in the return on the true up balance of million in  partially offset by an increase in operating income of million related to the return on the true up balance being recovered through the ctc 
this decrease is primarily due to the recording of the return on the true up balance for through in the fourth quarter of certain factors affecting future earnings our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations 
the magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including the timing and amount of our recovery of the true up components  including  in particular  the results of appeals to the courts of determinations on rulings obtained to date  state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments  including deregulation  re regulation  changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business and actions with respect to allowed rates of return  rate structures  recovery of investments  and operation and construction of facilities  timely and appropriate rate actions and increases  allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment  industrial  commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices  particularly natural gas  changes in interest rates or rates of inflation  weather variations and other natural phenomena  the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas  commercial bank and financial market conditions  our access to capital  the cost of such capital  and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts  including availability of funds in the debt capital markets  actions by rating agencies  effectiveness of our risk management activities  inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us  non payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers  including reliant energy  inc rri  the ability of rri to satisfy its obligations to us  including indemnity obligations  our ability to control costs  the investment performance of our employee benefit plans  our potential business strategies  including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses  which we cannot assure will provide the anticipated benefits to us  and other factors we discuss under risk factors in item a of this report

we reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary item of million per diluted share for as compared to million per diluted share for the increase in income from continuing operations of million was primarily due to increased operating income of million in our pipelines and field services business segment resulting from increased demand for transportation resulting from basis differentials across the system and higher demand for ancillary services as well as increased throughput and demand for services related to our core gas gathering operations  increased operating income of million in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment primarily due to higher sales to utilities and favorable basis differentials over the pipeline capacity that we control  a decrease in the operating loss of million in our other operations business segment resulting from increased overhead allocated in and a million decrease in interest expense due to lower borrowing levels and lower borrowing costs reflecting the replacement of certain of our credit facilities 
the above increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the return on the true up balance of our electric transmission distribution business segment as a result of the true up order  partially offset by an increase in operating income of million related to the return on the true up balance being recovered through the ctc  and decreased operating income of million in our electric transmission distribution business segment  excluding the ctc operating income discussed above  primarily from increased franchise fees paid to the city of houston  increased depreciation expense and higher operation and maintenance expenses  including higher transmission costs  the absence of a million partial reversal of a reserve related to the final fuel reconciliation recorded in the second quarter of and the absence of an million gain from a land sale recorded in  partially offset by increased usage mainly due to weather  continued customer growth and higher transmission cost recovery

future changes to the reserve will depend upon a number of variables  including the market price of tw common  the amount of zens oid  which increases quarterly  our assessment of available capital gains and the ultimate outcome of the dispute with the irs 
compared to income from continuing operations 
we reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary loss of million per diluted share for as compared to million per diluted share for the decrease in income from continuing operations of million was primarily due to the termination of revenues in our electric transmission distribution business segment related to ecom as of january   which had contributed million of income in  higher net transmission costs of million related to our electric transmission distribution business segment and increased interest expense of million related to continuing operations as discussed below

net cash provided by investing activities increased billion in as compared to primarily due to proceeds of billion received from the sale of texas genco s fossil generation assets in december  offset by the purchase of the minority interest in texas genco in december million and cash collateralization of letters of credit by texas genco related to its anticipated purchase of an additional interest in the south texas project in the first half of million 
cash used in financing activities in  debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by million 
proceeds from the december issuance of billion in transition bonds were used to repay borrowings under our credit facility and centerpoint houston s billion term loan 
in  debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by billion 
proceeds received from the sale of texas genco s fossil generation assets in december and the retail clawback payment from rri as discussed above were used to retire a million term loan  pay down million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and retire million of trust preferred securities 
as of december   we had borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility which were used to fund a portion of the million pension contribution made in december future sources and uses of cash our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  tax payments  working capital needs  various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions 
our principal cash requirements for include the following approximately billion of capital expenditures  including the construction of a new pipeline by our pipelines and field services business segment million and transmission project by our electric transmission distribution business segment million  dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock and debt service payments  and long term debt payments of million  including million of transition bonds 
we expect that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months 
cash needs may also be met by issuing securities in the capital markets 
the following table sets forth our capital expenditures for excluding capital expenditures of million related to discontinued operations  and estimates of our capital requirements for through in millions electric transmission distribution natural gas distribution competitive natural gas sales and services pipelines and field services other operations total  the following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations  including payments due by period in millions and contractual obligations total thereafter transition bond debt  including current portion   other long term debt  including current portion   interest payments transition bond debt interest payments other long term debt   capital leases operating leases benefit obligations purchase obligations non trading derivative liabilities other commodity commitments  total contractual cash obligations      transition charges are adjusted at least annually to cover debt service on transition bonds 
we calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows for fixed rate debt and term debt  we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates  for variable rate debt and or non term debt  we used interest rates in place as of december   we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations and short term borrowings 
for a discussion of operating leases  please read note b to our consolidated financial statements 
contributions to the pension plan are not required in  however  we expect to contribute approximately million to our postretirement benefits plan in to fund a portion of our obligations in accordance with rate orders or to fund pay as you go costs associated with the plan 
represents capital commitments for material in connection with the construction of a new pipeline by our pipelines and field services business segment 
this project has been included in the table of capital expenditures presented above 
for a discussion of other commodity commitments  please read note a to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
however  we do participate in a receivables factoring arrangement 
cerc corp 
has a bankruptcy remote subsidiary  which we consolidate  which was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables created by cerc and selling those receivables to an unrelated third party 
this transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and  as a result  the related receivables are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet 
in january  the million facility  which temporarily increased to million for the period from january to june  was extended to january as of december   cerc had million of advances under its receivables facility 
prior to centerpoint energy s distribution of its ownership in rri to its shareholders  cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri s trading subsidiary 
under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies  rri agreed to extinguish all such guarantee obligations prior to separation  but when separation occurred in september  rri had been unable to extinguish all obligations 
to secure centerpoint energy and cerc against obligations under the remaining guarantees  rri agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of cerc and centerpoint energy  and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guarantees 
our current exposure under the remaining guarantees relates to cerc s guarantee of the payment by rri of demand charges related to transportation contracts with one counterparty 
the demand charges are approximately million per year in through  million in  million in and million in as a result of changes in market conditions  centerpoint energy s potential exposure under that guarantee currently exceeds the security provided by rri 
centerpoint energy has requested rri to increase the amount of its existing letters of credit or  in the alternative  to obtain a release of cerc s obligations under the guarantee  and centerpoint energy and rri are pursuing alternatives 
rri continues to meet its obligations under the transportation contracts 
credit facilities 
in june  cerc corp 
replaced its million three year revolving credit facility with a million five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings under this facility may be made at libor plus basis points  including the facility fee  based on current credit ratings 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings whenever more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
cerc corp 
s million credit facility contains covenants  including a total debt to capitalization covenant of and an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to interest covenant 
borrowings under cerc corp 
s million credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred  so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied 
in march  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with a billion five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the facility at libor plus basis points based on current credit ratings 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings whenever more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
the facility contains covenants  including a debt to ebitda covenant and an ebitda to interest covenant 
borrowings under our credit facility are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type  including a requirement that we represent  except as described below  that no material adverse change has occurred at the time of a new borrowing under this facility 
a material adverse change is defined as the occurrence of a material adverse change in our ability to perform our obligations under the facility but excludes any litigation related to the true up order 
the base line for any determination of a relative material adverse change is our most recently audited financial statements 
at any time after the first time our credit ratings reach at least bbb by standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies s p  and baa by moody s investors service  inc moody s  bbb by s p and baa by moody s  or bbb by s p and baa by moody s  or if the drawing is to retire maturing commercial paper  we are not required to represent as a condition to such drawing that no material adverse change has occurred or that no litigation expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred 
also in march  centerpoint houston established a million five year revolving credit facility 
borrowings may be made under the facility at libor plus basis points based on centerpoint houston s current credit ratings 
an additional utilization fee of basis points applies to borrowings whenever more than of the facility is utilized 
changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the increment to libor depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered 
centerpoint houston s million credit facility contains covenants  including a debt excluding transition bonds to total capitalization covenant of and an ebitda to interest covenant 
borrowings under centerpoint houston s million credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred  so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied 
we  centerpoint houston and cerc corp 
are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants contained in the respective credit facilities 
as of february   we had the following credit facilities in millions amount utilized at date executed company size of facility february  termination date march  centerpoint energy  march  march  centerpoint houston march  june  cerc corp 
june  includes million of outstanding letters of credit and million of commercial paper backstopped by the credit facility 
represents million of outstanding letters of credit 
the billion centerpoint energy credit facility backstops a billion commercial paper program under which centerpoint energy began issuing commercial paper in june as of december   million of commercial paper was outstanding 
the commercial paper is rated not prime by moody s  a by s p and f by fitch  inc fitch and  as a result  we do not expect to be able to rely on the sale of commercial paper to fund all of our short term borrowing requirements 
we cannot assure you that these ratings  or the credit ratings set forth below in impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings  will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies 
during the fourth quarter of  centerpoint houston retired at maturity its billion term loan  which bore interest at libor plus basis points  subject to a minimum libor rate of percent 
it used its billion credit facility bearing interest at libor plus basis points to retire the term loan 
all amounts borrowed under the credit facility were repaid with a portion of the proceeds of the billion transition bonds referred to above 
securities registered with the sec 
at december   centerpoint energy had a shelf registration statement covering senior debt securities  preferred stock and common stock aggregating billion and cerc corp 
had a shelf registration statement covering million principal amount of debt securities 
temporary investments 
on december   we had no temporary investments 
money pool 
we have a money pool through which our participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short term basis 
funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position 
the net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under centerpoint energy s revolving credit facility or the sale of commercial paper 
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings 
as of february   moody s  s p  and fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries moody s s p fitch company instrument rating outlook rating outlook rating outlook centerpoint energy senior unsecured debt ba stable bbb stable bbb stable centerpoint houston senior secured debt first mortgage bonds baa stable bbb stable a stable cerc corp 
senior debt baa stable bbb stable bbb stable a stable outlook from moody s indicates that moody s does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed 
an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a stable outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our billion credit facility  centerpoint houston s million credit facility and cerc s million revolving credit facility 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
additionally  a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments 
as described above under credit facilities  our revolving credit facility contains a material adverse change clause that could impact our ability to make new borrowings under this facility 
centerpoint houston s million credit facility and cerc corp 
s million credit facility do not contain material adverse change clauses with respect to borrowings 
in september  we issued zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens having an original principal amount of billion 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common equal to of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the zens notes and tw common shares become current tax obligations when zens notes are exchanged and tw common shares are sold 
ces  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp 
operating in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states 
in order to hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  ces uses financial derivatives with provisions standard for the industry that establish credit thresholds and require a party to provide additional collateral on two business days notice when that party s rating or the rating of a credit support provider for that party cerc corp 
in this case falls below those levels 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly lower 
in addition  cerc and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of million based on cerc s s p senior unsecured long term debt rating of bbb 
upgrades and downgrades from this bbb rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly 
cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default 
pursuant to the indenture governing our senior notes  a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million will cause a default 
as of february   we had issued six series of senior notes aggregating billion in principal amount under this indenture 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including gas purchases  gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments  particularly given gas price levels and volatility  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of gas  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities  various regulatory actions  the ability of rri and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of centerpoint houston and in respect of rri s indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries  slower customer payments and increased write offs of receivables due to higher gas prices  cash payments in connection with the exercise of contingent conversion rights of holders of convertible debt  contributions to benefit plans  restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from natural disasters such as hurricanes  and various other risks identified in risk factors in item a of this report 
certain contractual limits on our ability to issue securities  borrow money and pay dividends on our common stock 
centerpoint houston s credit facility limits centerpoint houston s debt  excluding transi tion bonds  as a percentage of its total capitalization to percent 
centerpoint houston s million credit facility also contains an ebitda to interest covenant 
cerc corp 
s bank facility and its receivables facility limit cerc s debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to percent and contain an ebitda to interest covenant 
our billion credit facility contains a debt to ebitda covenant and an ebitda to interest covenant 
additionally  in connection with the issuance of a certain series of general mortgage bonds  centerpoint houston agreed not to issue  subject to certain exceptions  additional first mortgage bonds 
we were a registered public utility holding company under the act 
the act and related rules and regulations imposed a number of restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries 
the energy act repealed the act effective february   and since that date we and our subsidiaries have no longer been subject to restrictions imposed under the act 
the energy act includes puhca which grants to the ferc authority to require holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the ferc and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances 
on december   the ferc issued rules implementing puhca that will require us to notify the ferc of our status as a holding company and to maintain certain books and records and make these available to the ferc 
the ferc continues to consider motions for rehearing or clarification of these rules 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
application of sfas no 
to the electric generation portion of our business was discontinued as of june  our electric transmission distribution business continues to apply sfas no 
which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of sfas no 
with respect to our electric transmission distribution business segment relate to million of recoverable electric generation related regulatory assets as of december  these costs are recoverable under the provisions of the texas electric restructuring law 
based on our analysis of the true up order  we recorded an after tax charge to earnings in of approximately million to write down our electric generation related regulatory assets to their realizable value  which was reflected as an extraordinary loss 
based on subsequent orders received from the texas utility commission  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million after tax in the second quarter of related to the regulatory asset 
additionally  a district court in travis county  texas issued a judgment that would have the effect of restoring approximately million  plus interest  of disallowed costs 
appeals of the district court s judgment are still pending 
no amounts related to the court s judgment have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
we perform our goodwill impairment test at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we initially selected january as our annual goodwill impairment testing date 
since the time we selected the january date  our year end closing and reporting process has been truncated in order to meet the accelerated periodic reporting requirements of the sec  resulting in significant constraints on our human resources at year end and during our first fiscal quarter 
accordingly  in order to meet the accelerated reporting deadlines and to provide adequate time to complete the analysis each year  beginning in the third quarter of  we changed the date on which we perform our annual goodwill impairment test from january to july we believe the july alternative date will alleviate the resource constraints that exist during the first quarter and allow us to utilize additional resources in conducting the annual impairment evaluation of goodwill 
we performed the test at july   and determined that no impairment charge for goodwill was required 
the change is not intended to delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
we believe that this accounting change is an alternative accounting principle that is preferable under the circumstances 
asset retirement obligations we account for our long lived assets under sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
fin 
sfas no 
and fin require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in the same period  the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
rate regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with sfas no 
and fin  and costs recovered through the ratemaking process 
we estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components inflation adjustment the estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor  equipment  materials  and other disposal costs  discount rate the estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium  and third party markup adjustments internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset 
changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under sfas no 
and fin for example  if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate by basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage 
at december   our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately million 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to the sale and or delivery of electricity or natural gas energy are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we use several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded 
please read other significant matters pension plan for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements see note n to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
other significant matters pension plan 
as discussed in note o to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
at december   the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets by million  however  the market value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in and beyond 
although we have not been required to make contributions to our pension plan in or  we have made voluntary contributions of million and million in and  respectively 
under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa and the internal revenue code 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
pension costs were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in addition  included in the costs for  and are million  million and less than million  respectively  of expense related to texas genco participants 
pension expense for texas genco participants is reflected in the statement of consolidated operations as discontinued operations 
additionally  we maintain a non qualified benefit restoration plan which allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated 
the expense associated with this non qualified plan was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was  which is unchanged from the rate assumed as of december  we believe that our actual asset allocation  on average  will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a decline from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
currently  pension plan assets excluding the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceed the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
however  if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation  accumulated benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would have significant impacts on our consolidated balance sheet by changing the pension asset recorded as of december  of million to a pension liability of million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in of million  net of tax 
for the benefit restoration plan  if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation  accumulated benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million  million  and less than million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would result in a charge to comprehensive income of approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk we have outstanding long term debt  bank loans  mandatory redeemable preferred securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely our junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities  some lease obligations and our obligations under our zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
in  we had interest rate swaps in place in order to hedge portions of our floating rate debt 
our floating rate obligations aggregated billion and million at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would not materially change 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities and trust preferred securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective january   the zens obligation was bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  is a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  a million recorded liability at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated operations and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on our zens obligation and our historical accounting treatment of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
commodity price risk from non trading activities to reduce our commodity price risk from market fluctuations in the revenues derived from the sale of natural gas and related transportation  we enter into forward contracts  swaps and options non trading energy derivatives in order to hedge some expected purchases of natural gas and sales of natural gas a portion of which are firm commitments at the inception of the hedge 
non trading energy derivatives are also utilized to fix the price of future operational gas requirements 
we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in earnings based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
at december   the recorded fair value of our non trading energy derivatives was a net asset of million 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for hedging purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions  assuming the non trading energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term  the non trading energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  and as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
if any of the above mentioned assumptions ceases to be true  a loss on the derivative instruments may occur  or the options might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date  whichever comes first 
non trading energy derivatives designated and effective as hedges  may still have some percentage which is not effective 
the change in value of the non trading energy derivatives that represents the ineffective component of the hedges is recorded in our results of operations 
we have established a risk oversight committee composed of corporate and business segment officers  that oversees our commodity price and credit risk activities  including our trading  marketing  risk management services and hedging activities 
the committee s duties are to establish commodity risk policies  allocate risk capital within limits established by our board of directors  approve trading of new products and commodities  monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with our risk management policies and procedures and trading limits established by our board of directors 
our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments 
a leveraged financial instrument  for this purpose  is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument
