item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year is from november to october unless otherwise stated  references to the years   and relate to the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
references to future years also relate to our fiscal year ending october introduction and overview fiscal year was a transition year for the company 
compared to fiscal  our revenues declined  to million  and our net loss  including impairment  restructuring and other charges of million  increased from million  or per share  to million  or per share 
despite the decline in our financial performance  we exited a much healthier and more focused company 
the transition in was extensive and challenging  but was critical to our long term success 
significant leadership changes were made early in the year  followed by a thorough assessment of products and development projects 
this assessment resulted in a product roadmap which we believe will make our product offerings the strongest in the industry 
we were required to make some difficult decisions regarding our workforce in these decisions were necessary to reduce our cost structure and to align the personnel and structure of our sales and development organizations with the new business direction 
we also spent a considerable amount of time and effort during the year on developing the internal systems  processes  and disciplines necessary to support our long term growth plans 
in executing the transition  we incurred non cash technology impairment charges of million  cash and non cash restructuring and other charges totaling million  and reduced our operating expenses from in  we put in place the people  product plans  and processes necessary for our future success and believe that these efforts have positioned us for growth and profitability in and beyond 
our business  however  is not without risks and uncertainties 
we derive the majority of our revenues from public school funding  which is dependent on support from federal  state  and local governments 
in addition  our success is dependent on continued and growing market acceptance of curriculum based educational software 
this acceptance is subject to changes in teacher  student  and parent preferences for interactive educational technology  and our ability to continue to demonstrate improvements in academic performance at schools that use our educational software 
we will continue to transition our business model to fee based online subscription services 
our revenue decline in was due primarily to a decline in products sold on a one time perpetual license fee basis 
these license fees are a large one time investment for many of our customers  are difficult to predict  and require product upgrades and enhancements to persuade customers to continue to upgrade the products they purchase 
our product strategy emphasizes subscription based products  but the transition to a subscription based model can reduce revenue or revenue growth during the transition 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business  refer to part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
we understand the risks and challenges to growing our business and returning it to consistent profitability  but we believe we are well positioned to address them 
we believe that education remains one of the last great market opportunities where software products have yet to live up to their true potential 
we believe we have a highly recognized brand in education  loyal and satisfied customers  a broad portfolio of products  state of the art product development capabilities  and a talented base of employees who deeply understand education and are dedicated to making a difference to our customers and their students 
our outlook for is consistent with our belief that was a turnaround year for the company 
order growth is expected to be in the range of to 
revenues are expected to grow by no more than over  however  as much of the order growth is expected to come from new products introduced to the market throughout the year and from products sold on a subscription fee basis  rather than a perpetual license fee basis 
the restructuring activities we undertook in will favorably affect our year over year operating 
table of contents expense comparisons excluding restructuring charges  offset partially by increases in stock based compensation expense as we adopt the provisions of fasb statement no 
r 
as a result of these changes  we expect to be modestly profitable in for a more detailed discussion of our outlook  see the section captioned fiscal year outlook below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  and have identified revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized product development costs  the valuation of our deferred income taxes  and the valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and identified intangible assets  as the critical accounting policies and estimates that are significant to the financial statement presentation  and that require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
our discussion of these policies is intended to supplement  but not replace  the more detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies and disclosures contained in note to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is considered critical for several reasons 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex  can involve significant judgment  and can vary across the variety of products and services we offer 
as a result  revenue results can be difficult to predict  and any delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded 
in general  revenue from the sale of courseware licenses is recognized when all of the following conditions are met i a written customer order has been executed  ii courseware has been delivered  iii the license fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the fee is probable 
certain judgments can affect how these specific rules are applied to individual transactions 
these judgments typically involve whether collectibility can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  if collectibility of the fee is not probable  revenue is not recognized until payments are received  or  if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is not recognized until the payments become due 
in  we implemented a policy which requires  in most instances  that a purchase order signed by the customer be received by us prior to the recognition of revenue 
we believe this policy change has reduced the level of judgment with respect to these revenue recognition criteria 
our transactions often consist of multiple element  or bundled  arrangements 
software revenue recognition rules require that these orders be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each bundled element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
in addition to providing our courseware licenses on a one time  perpetual license basis  certain courseware is also provided on a subscription basis 
revenues from products sold on a subscription basis are recognized ratably as the products are delivered over the subscription period 
we also provide professional services related to our products  including consulting  training  and implementation services  as well as ongoing software support and maintenance 
consulting  training  and implementation services are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
accordingly  revenues from these services are recognized separately 
software support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the support period  and consulting  training and implementation services are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts  historical experience  and the aging of our trade and installment accounts receivable 
bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine the allowance are 
table of contents subject to revision and can involve significant judgment 
the primary factors that impact these assumptions include our credit assessment process  our historical experience  and the efficiency and effectiveness of our billing and collection functions 
we believe that the current budget difficulties facing many states will not have a significant impact on the collection of our accounts receivable 
in  we significantly reduced the variety of payment terms offered to our customers which had the effect of reducing our bad debt exposure 
however  a change in the underlying conditions contributing to these beliefs could impact our assessment of collectibility and  therefore  require a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts and the amount of bad debt expense 
such a change may have a significant impact on future results of operations 
capitalized product development costs 
our investments in product development are significant  and the rules that govern how these costs are accounted for in our financial statements can have a significant impact on our operating results from period to period 
our product development activities relate to the research  development  enhancement  and maintenance of our courseware products 
costs related to the initial design and development of new products and the routine enhancement and maintenance of existing products  are expensed as incurred 
when projects in the initial design and development phase reach technological feasibility  we begin capitalization of the related project costs 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
a significant portion of our product development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of our courseware 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenues related to license fees and subscriptions 
we evaluate our capitalized costs on an quarterly basis to determine if the unamortized balance related to any given product  or group of products  exceeds its estimated net realizable value 
estimating net realizable value requires us to use judgment in projecting future revenues and cash flows to be generated by the product and thereby quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows and amounts realized from the courseware products could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our courseware product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
as further discussed below in the section captioned gross profit  this evaluation as of october  resulted in an impairment charge of million related to capitalized software 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
our accounting policy for the valuation of deferred income taxes is considered critical for several reasons 
significant judgment is required in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance 
in addition  income tax accounting rules  in combination with purchase accounting rules applied in the acquisition of lightspan in  result in a complex tax accounting situation in which we currently do not recognize tax benefits on operating losses or on the realization of deferred tax assets  but regardless of our operating results  recognize tax expense on future tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill 
the majority of our deferred tax assets represent net operating loss carryforwards which are available to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards include those acquired in the acquisition of lightspan in  as well as carryforward losses that existed prior to the acquisition or incurred after the acquisition 
our ability to realize the benefit of these loss carryforwards is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
at the time of the acquisition  our history of cumulative operating losses  including those at lightspan prior to the acquisition  was evidence that we would not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of carryforward losses 
as a result  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at that time and  under purchase accounting rules  the write off was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
although we expect to be profitable in  historical results carry more weight in the assessment of the valuation allowance 
as a result  our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved at october  excluded from our calculation of net deferred tax assets is a deferred tax liability related to tax deductible goodwill 
the timing of the reversal of this difference is considered indefinite because it will not reverse until the underlying assets that created the goodwill are disposed of or sold 
accordingly  this timing difference cannot be used to support the realization of other deferred tax assets which have definite lives 

table of contents our net deferred tax assets will remain fully reserved until the related tax benefits are realized through the generation of taxable income in a particular year  or until we can demonstrate a history of generating taxable income 
in either case  the related tax benefits will be recorded first as a reduction to goodwill  as opposed to being recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
goodwill and identified intangible assets 
goodwill and identified intangible assets are recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
most of the companies we have acquired have not had significant tangible assets 
as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price paid in acquisitions has been allocated to identified intangible assets and or goodwill 
the allocation of the excess purchase price requires that we make significant assumptions and estimates 
these include projections of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and estimates of their expected useful lives 
identified intangible assets are amortized to expense over their expected useful lives and goodwill is not amortized 
once established  these assets are subject to periodic impairment assessments to determine if their current carrying values are recoverable based on information available at the time these assessments are made 
significant assumptions and estimates are also required in making these assessments 
accordingly  the assumptions and estimates we use in implementing this policy affect the amount of identified intangible asset amortization and impairment charges  if any  reflected in our operating results 
as further discussed below in the section captioned gross profit  our impairment assessment at october  resulted in a charge of million related to acquired technology assets from previous acquisitions general factors affecting our financial results in addition to the effects the application of our critical accounting policies can have on our financial results as discussed above  a number of other general factors can affect our results from period to period 
these factors are discussed below 
revenue 
a large portion of our revenues are derived from the sale of one time  perpetual licenses to our software products 
these sales are reported as license fees in our consolidated statement of operations 
changes in the quantity and size of these individual sales can have a significant impact on the comparability of revenues from period to period 
in addition  as is common in the software industry  a large portion of our customer orders tend to occur in the final weeks or days of each fiscal quarter 
as a result  license revenues can be heavily influenced by events such as funding approvals that may be outside our control during this short span of time 
subscription based license fees and software support fees included in services revenues are earned ratably throughout the year 
historically these revenues together have made up less than of total revenues 
however  as these revenues grow as a percentage of total revenues  our period to period revenues will become more comparable and predictable 
our business is also very seasonal  with the largest portion of our license fees typically coming in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  and professional service fees being the greatest during periods in which schools are in session 
while this seasonality does not generally impact the comparability of our annual results  it can significantly impact our results from quarter to quarter 
gross profit percentage 
our gross profit percentage during a period is dependent on a number of factors 
license fee revenues have high gross profit margins due to the low direct cost of delivering these products 
as a result  the mix of license fee revenues to total revenues in a given period significantly influences reported total gross profit margins 
in addition  a large portion of our costs of revenue are fixed in nature 
these costs include amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support our hosted subscription services  customer support operations  and full time professional services personnel who deliver our training services 
accordingly  increases in revenues allow us to leverage these costs resulting in higher gross profit margins  while decreases in revenues have the opposite effect 
operating expenses 
incentive compensation is a significant variable component of our sales and marketing expenses  approximating of total revenues in any given period 
sales and marketing expenses also include costs such as travel  tradeshows  and conferences that can vary with revenue activity or individual events that occur during the period 

table of contents general and administrative expenses are substantially fixed in nature 
however  certain components such as our provision for bad debts  professional fees  and other expenses can vary based on business results  individual events  or initiatives we may be pursuing at various times throughout the year 
product development expense in our consolidated statement of operations does not reflect our total level of product development spending 
costs to enhance or maintain existing products  or to develop products prior to achieving technological feasibility  are charged to product development expense as incurred 
costs incurred to develop new products after technological feasibility is achieved  which represent the majority of our total development spending  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenues 
accordingly  product development expense in our consolidated statement of operations can fluctuate from period to period  in terms of both total dollars and as a percentage of revenue  based on the nature and timing of the development activities occurring during the period 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of certain identified intangible assets acquired through various acquisitions 
these expenses are generally predictable from period to period because they are fixed over the course of their individual useful lives 
results of operations non gaap financial measures the following discussion of the results of operations for compared to includes non gaap financial measures that present revenues and certain operating expenses on a pro forma basis as if lightspan  which was acquired on november   had been acquired as of november  these adjustments are generally the same as those presented in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k a 
results of operations for reflect gaap results from the date of acquisition  and are not adjusted to reflect pro forma results prior to the acquisition date  as such adjustments are not material to this analysis 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
our management views these non gaap financial measures as useful in facilitating internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors operating results 
we include these non gaap financial measures because we believe they are useful to investors by allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental information used by our management in its financial and operational analysis 
investors are encouraged to review the following reconciliation of selected non gaap financial measures used herein to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures as provided with our consolidated financial statements

table of contents revenues the following tables summarize certain key information to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of revenues orders greater than  change change amount from amount from pro forma number value s average value s revenue dollars in thousands percent percent change change from amount from amount pro forma pro forma license fees subscriptions services other vs 
total revenues in declined to million  from million in  reflecting a significant decrease in license fee orders and revenues 
the number of orders greater than  declined  and the related value of these orders declined by 
these declines reflect lower sales productivity caused by changes we made during in the sales organization  and the systems  processes and procedures they use 
many of these changes resulted in significant voluntary and involuntary turnover in our sales organization 
while these changes were disruptive in the short term  we considered them necessary to position our sales organization for long term  profitable growth 
this decline in sales productivity also contributed to decreases in subscription revenues and other revenues during the year 
service revenues increased in and benefited from the large deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the year 
service revenue growth also reflects an increase in supplemental educational services  which were provided for the first time in  and increases in software support fees from a growing customer base and delivery of training services 
vs 
total reported revenues increased to million in from million in  primarily reflecting the acquisition of lightspan early in on a pro forma basis  total revenues increased 
the quantity of orders greater than  increased slightly from to  but the average order size increased  reflecting several large customer orders in the increase in average order size did not translate into a comparable increase in license revenues due to our increased focus on subscriptions revenue and professional development services 
this shift in focus was reflected in the increases in subscriptions and services revenues from to  and a corresponding decrease in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue 

table of contents gross profit the following table summarizes the percentage of total revenue  and the gross profit percentage for each revenue category 
this information is provided as an aid to the understanding of our discussion and analysis of gross profit gross profit percent percent of total revenue revenue category pro forma pro forma license fees subscriptions services other total vs 
the total gross profit percentage decreased from in to in  primarily due to million in asset impairment charges on capitalized product development costs and purchased technology assets 
the impairment charges resulted from our evaluation of expected future revenues from certain products given our financial performance and changes in product development strategies formalized in the fourth quarter 
these product development strategy changes were driven by the completion of our strategic planning process 
impairment charges related to capitalized product development costs were million  and were primarily related to instructional management and delivery platform products which are expected to be phased out or discontinued when a replacement product is released in impairment charges related to purchased technology assets were million  and were primarily related to products which  based on the product development strategy implemented in  are expected to be replaced sooner than originally anticipated 
the change in product strategy also contributed to a decrease in the anticipated future cash flows from these products relative to the cash flows expected at the time these assets were purchased 
excluding the effect of the impairment charges  our gross profit percentage declined percentage points from  primarily due to changes in the mix of our revenues 
higher margin license fee revenues declined from to of total revenue  while lower margin service revenues increased from to of total revenues 
these changes in revenue mix were due to the sales productivity factors discussed under revenues above 
the decline in subscription margins in was due to additional non recurring royalty fees incurred  and to lower subscription revenues on a base of primarily fixed costs which includes amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  and depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support these hosted services 
amortization of previously capitalized product development costs  a component of cost of revenue related to license fees and subscriptions  was million and for and  respectively 
we expect this amortization to decrease in as a result of the related asset impairment charges recorded in  partially offset by increases as additional products are completed and capitalized 
vs 
the total gross profit percentage was  a decrease of percentage points from reported gross profit percentage  and from the pro forma gross profit percentage 
this decrease in from both reported and pro forma margins resulted primarily from the higher proportion of subscriptions  services  and other revenues included in the product sales mix in  which carry lower margins 
also contributing to the decline was the increase in amortization of capitalized product development costs and acquired technology from million on a pro forma basis in  to million in this increase reflects amortization on product development projects completed during and that began being amortized to expense in  and the amortization of technology related intangible assets acquired in the lightspan acquisition 
the amortization increase was the primary reason for the decline in subscription margins from to 
table of contents operating expenses the following table summarizes the percentage of total revenue and percentage change in total spending from the previous year for certain operating expense line items 
this information is provided as an aid to the understanding of our discussion and analysis of our operating expenses 
percent change percent of total revenue pro forma pro forma to to sales and marketing general and administrative product development amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges n a n a n a vs 
total operating expenses  including restructuring and other charges of million  were million 
excluding these charges  total operating expenses decreased million from  or  for the reasons outlined below 
sales and marketing expenses were million in as compared to million in  representing a decrease in both dollars and percentage of total revenue 
these decreases primarily reflect the sales organization changes and process and cost reductions we initiated in this resulted in voluntary and involuntary sales force attrition which resulted in reduced salaries  travel  professional services  facilities and other related costs 
also contributing to the decline were the realignment of our service resources from sales support to billable activities which shifted some costs from selling expense to cost of revenues and decreased commissions resulting from the decrease in revenues 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in  representing a decrease in total spending of  but an increase as a percent of total revenues 
the decline in total spending was due primarily to a reduction in bad debt expense due to tighter credit and payment terms and the reduction in total revenues 
cost reduction activities initiated in also resulted in additional savings  but were offset by increased professional fees for sarbanes oxley compliance  senior management and board member changes  and process improvement initiatives in had these additional offset expenses not been incurred in  we would have expected general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue to remain flat  or decline slightly  from product development expenses for were million  representing a decrease from the million reported for product development expense decreased due primarily to a shift in spending mix toward more capitalized projects compared to total product development spending  which represents spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to total spending in of million  or of total revenues 
significant product development projects in were related to math and science courseware and an instructional management platform 
late in  we restructured our development activities to take advantage of lower cost offshore development resources 
although we expect this restructuring to achieve significant savings in unit labor costs  we expect to invest these savings in additional product development 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions  the last of which was the lightspan acquisition in november amortization of million in was comparable to  given that the related assets are amortized on a straight line basis and were unchanged from to restructuring and other charges in totaled million related to restructuring activities in our uk subsidiary and our north american operations  primarily in our sales and development organizations 
the north american restructuring activities were designed to lower costs and align these organizations with our new business direction  while the uk activities were designed to lower costs in line with revenue expectations 
table of contents in this geographic market 
these costs consist of million in severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees  million related to executive officer terminations under employment agreements  million in costs related to facility closures  and million in other charges 
no restructuring costs were incurred in on october   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an acceleration of the vesting of all unvested  underwater stock options having an exercise price greater than the closing price of of our common stock on that date 
the acceleration covers approximately  outstanding options with a weighted average exercise price of 
approximately  of these options are held by executive management  who will be restricted from selling such shares  subject to certain exceptions  prior to the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option s original vesting terms 
the objectives of the acceleration were to eliminate pre tax compensation expense of million that otherwise would have been recognized in our future consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  on november   and to improve employee retention 
vs 
total operating expenses in were million  an increase of million  or over reported operating expenses due primarily to the lightspan acquisition  and to a lesser degree  the new media acquisition  both of which occurred early in fiscal year the effect of the acquisition was to significantly increase  relative to  the reported amounts of sales and marketing  general and administrative and product development expenses due to the combination of the two company s cost structures 
sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  in total  declined in from pro forma levels in terms of both total spending and as a percentage of total revenues 
these declines were the result of cost reduction plans implemented at the time of the acquisition  as well as the synergistic benefits received from combining the plato learning and lightspan activities in these areas 
product development expenses declined in from pro forma levels  and also benefited from cost reduction plans and other synergistic benefits achieved from the acquisitions  as well as an increase in the mix of capitalized versus expensed development projects 
total product development spending  which represents spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to million on an as reported basis in  or of total revenues 
while this spending percentage decreased slightly  aided in part by our acquisitions of developed technologies and curriculum content  our spending dollars increased significantly due to substantial investments to develop science and other courseware in amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions 
amortization in increased to million from million in  primarily reflecting the related intangible assets acquired in the lightspan acquisition 
restructuring charges in totaled million consisting primarily of severance and other costs related to the replacement of our managing director of our uk operations  the termination of two senior executives our chief operating officer and a co founder of netschools and three other employees  and a reduction in the size of our us workforce by approximately positions 
these actions were taken in connection with restructuring plans intended to align our cost structure with future expectations 
there were no restructuring costs in interest income vs 
interest income in increased million to million 
this increase reflects an increase in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and the related interest rates earned on these investments 
vs 
interest income in was million compared to million in  reflecting a comparable increase in average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances from to 
table of contents income taxes as discussed earlier in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as a result of the lightspan acquisition  our net deferred tax assets as of the acquisition date  excluding the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill which cannot be used to support realization of net deferred tax assets  were fully reserved in the first quarter of  resulting in an increase to goodwill in purchase accounting 
accordingly  any reversal of this valuation allowance due to the subsequent realization of the deferred tax assets is recorded as a reduction to goodwill  as opposed to recording an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million  consisting of million related to tax deductible goodwill which cannot be offset against existing deferred tax assets  and million related to income taxes paid in states in which income taxes are not filed on a unitary  or consolidated legal entity basis 
because these states do not allow for the preparation of a consolidated tax return  certain legal entities under which we operate in the us may have taxable income in these states which can not be offset by losses from other legal entities 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million  consisting of million for our us income  and million related to the tax deductible goodwill mentioned earlier 
as discussed above  the net realization of previously reserved deferred tax assets resulting from us income is a reduction in goodwill  rather than a reduction in income tax expense related to our us operations 
we do not recognize a tax benefit for losses in our foreign subsidiaries due to the uncertainty of realizing these foreign tax benefits in future years 
in we recorded an income tax benefit of million  or of the pretax loss 
our historical effective income tax rate has been highly volatile due to the mix between our us operating results  for which we record income taxes  and our foreign operating results  for which we do not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty of realizing these foreign tax benefits in future years 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
at october   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million from october  approximately million of this increase represents the net conversion of long term and short term marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents during the year 
the balance of the increase reflects cash flows from operations in of million and million in proceeds primarily from the exercise of employee stock options  offset by investments of million in capitalized product development and million in equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows from operations in were down million from  reflecting the significant increase in our net loss in the investments in capitalized new product development were comparable to levels and primarily related to math and science courseware and an instructional management platform 
equipment and leasehold improvement purchases in were down significantly from  which included significant investments in sales organization productivity tools 
cash and cash equivalent balances at october  were million  an increase of million during the year 
cash generated from operations in was million  and an additional million in cash was generated by exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants and by common stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
expenditures during the year on capitalized product development were million and reflected substantial investments to develop science and other courseware 
purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements totaled million reflecting the implementation of a new customer relationship management system and the purchase of new laptop computers  both expected to improve field sales productivity 
excess cash and cash equivalents generated during the year of million were converted to short term marketable securities 
working capital and liquidity 
at october   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling of million  net accounts receivable of million  and our unused line of credit of million 
working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at october  and  respectively 

table of contents the decrease in working capital was primarily due to a million decrease in net accounts receivable  offset by a million increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as discussed above  and a million decrease in deferred revenues 
the decrease in receivables reflect collections from our strong fourth quarter revenues and lower fourth quarter revenues while the decrease in deferred revenues was generally driven by the decline in order volume from to on june   we extended our revolving loan agreement with wells fargo bank  na  through january  the revolving loan agreement provides for a maximum million line of credit  as determined by the available borrowing base 
the agreement contains restrictive financial covenants including minimum tangible net worth  minimum debt service coverage  maximum leverage  maximum cash flow leverage and maximum annual capital expenditures and restrictions on additional borrowings  asset sales and dividends  as defined 
certain of the covenant calculations are based on the trailing twelve month period 
all applicable covenants were satisfied as of october   and our unused borrowing capacity was million 
negotiations are in progress to replace this agreement prior to its expiration 
our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  the timing and extent of product development expenditures  changes in customer order volume  the timing and collection of receivables  and expenditures in connection with possible acquisitions or stock repurchases 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  available credit lines and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist primarily of future minimum payments due under operating leases  royalty agreements  and capital lease obligations 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving loan agreement as discussed above would require future use of cash 
payments due by period more year to to than contractual obligations total or less years years years in thousands operating leases royalty agreements capital leases obligations total at october   we had no significant commitments for capital expenditures 
with the acquisition of new media in  there is additional deferred consideration of approximately  due over the period from the acquisition date through december based on new media revenues 
disclosures about off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or fiscal year outlook our outlook for our financial performance includes revenue growth of up to over  and a return to modest profitability 
this outlook reflects our belief that in  we will begin experiencing the benefits of our turnaround efforts 
sales order growth in is expected to be in the range of to as a result of increased sales productivity and new product introductions 
revenue growth  however  is not expected to be greater than due to several factors 
much of the order growth is expected to be from sales of new products that will not be introduced until later in  and from sales of subscription products that are recognized as revenue over time rather than upon sale and delivery 
in addition  international revenues are expected to decline in due to the downsizing of our uk operations  which we expect to breakeven in we are also changing our 
table of contents strategy with regard to participation in the supplemental educational services ses market in which will result in reduced service revenues 
rather than providing these services directly ourselves  we will serve this market by providing our products to other ses providers 
the total gross margin for the year is expected to be between and  depending on product mix  as cost reductions and pricing controls established in will be in place for the entire year in in addition  product development and technology related intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of revenues will be lower in as a result of the asset impairment charges incurred in operating expenses  excluding restructuring and other charges  should remain relatively stable as expected declines in expenses will be substantially offset by stock based compensation expense as the company adopts fasb statement no 
r 
restructuring charges related to actions taken in  but were not accruable at that time  are expected to be less than million 
the tax provision in is expected to be million higher than the amount calculated by applying a tax rate to pretax earnings  reflecting tax deductible goodwill from a previous acquisition that creates a deferred tax liability that cannot be offset against deferred tax assets 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are expected to decline modestly for the full year  as investments in product development are increased to accelerate the release of new products 
spending on capitalized product development projects is expected to range from to million  depending on the timing of those projects 
interest rate risk our borrowing capacity primarily consists of a revolving loan with interest rates that fluctuate based upon the prime rate and libor market indexes

 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb  that was issued in the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged
