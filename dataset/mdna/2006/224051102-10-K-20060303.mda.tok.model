item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading national radio broadcast company whose business is acquiring  developing and operating radio stations located throughout the united states 
cox enterprises indirectly owns approximately of our common stock and has approximately of the voting power of cox radio 
the primary source of our revenues is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
historically  approximately and of our net revenues have been generated from local and national advertising  respectively 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  our stations also exchange advertising time for goods  services or programming  which can be used by the stations in their business operations 
the use of such barter transactions is generally confined to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
barter transactions for programming are used to supplement station program offerings 
advertising spots given up under these arrangements are based on contractual terms 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees salaries and benefits  commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are typically lowest in the first quarter 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
critical accounting estimates use of estimates our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the radio broadcasting industry 
an accounting estimate would be a critical accounting estimate for purposes of the disclosure in this report only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  contingencies and litigation  income taxes and fair value of financial instruments as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates that require the most significant judgments and assumptions and are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the preparation of the financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of fcc broadcast licenses  but also include goodwill and certain other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
we evaluate our fcc licenses for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
fcc licenses are evaluated for impairment at the market level using the direct method 
if the carrying amount of fcc licenses is greater than their estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of fcc licenses in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value 
we also evaluate goodwill in each of our reporting units markets for impairment annually  or more 
table of contents frequently if certain circumstances are present  using the residual method 
if the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit is greater than the implied value of goodwill for that reporting unit determined from the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit is reduced to its estimated fair value 
as a result of the impairment test  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax in the fourth quarter of the million reflects charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the birmingham market to its fair market value 
we utilize independent appraisals in testing fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment 
these appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
we evaluate amortizing intangible assets for recoverability when circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  using an undiscounted cash flow methodology 
if the future undiscounted cash flows for the intangible asset are less than net book value  net book value is reduced to the estimated fair value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific party s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other parties  the evaluation considers the balance of aged receivables  the nature and volume of the portfolio  specific problem accounts and notes receivable  and economic conditions that may affect the debtor s ability to repay  and such other factors as  in our judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
accounts and notes receivable are charged off to the allowance when  in our opinion  such receivables are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
in addition  we consider the customer s creditworthiness prior to revenue recognition 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 
income tax estimates the provision for income taxes is based on current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  changes in our operations in various jurisdictions  income tax rates and tax positions taken on returns 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the application and interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations 
in the normal course of business  our filed tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
these examinations could result in challenges to tax positions that we have taken 
these challenges could arise from a variety of tax issues such as the deductibility of certain expenses  the timing of the recognition of income and expense  allocations of income and expense between states  the tax basis of certain assets and the taxation of acquisitions and disposals 
ultimately  the results of these challenges could require us to pay additional taxes and could also require the payment of interest assessments 
we accrue a liability when we believe that an assessment is probable 
in connection with the conclusion of federal income tax audits for the years  we paid approximately million in taxes related to certain radio station transactions completed during the audit period 
we had previously provided for the possibility of this outcome 
as a result of the audit  a reclassification between current and deferred tax liability and expense was made during results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

local revenues are comprised of advertising sales made within a station s local market or region either directly with the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency

however  the compensation committee left the exercise date and all other option terms unchanged 
the purpose of accelerating the vesting of these options was to allow us to avoid recognition of compensation expense associated with these options in future periods as the exercise prices exceeded the market value of the underlying stock on october  incremental pre tax expense of million associated with the acceleration is reflected in the pro forma disclosure included in note to our consolidated financial statements

in comparing to  net cash provided by operating activities decreased million primarily due to the income tax audit payment described above and changes in working capital 
we expect future net cash provided by operating activities to provide sufficient funding for our operations in the near term 
primary uses of liquidity include debt service as discussed below  acquisitions  capital expenditures and investment in signal upgrades 
the following table summarizes acquisitions  capital expenditures and investment in signal upgrades for the past three years amounts in thousands acquisitions capital expenditures investment in signal upgrades we have an effective shelf registration statement under which we may from time to time offer and issue debentures  notes  bonds and other indebtedness and forward contracts in respect of any such indebtedness  shares of preferred stock  shares of class a common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and stock purchase rights  and two financing trusts sponsored by us may also offer and issue preferred securities of the trusts for an original maximum aggregate offering amount of million

debt service on june   we entered into a million  five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the interest rate for this facility is  at our option the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds borrowing rate plus the libor plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior long term debt  the bid rate for the purchase of certificates of deposit of equal principal amount and maturity plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior long term debt  or the federal funds borrowing rate plus a spread based on the credit ratings of our senior long term debt 
the credit facility includes commitment fees on the unused portion of the total amount available  which fees range from to depending on the credit rating of our senior long term debt 
the credit facility contains  among other provisions  specified leverage and interest coverage requirements  the terms of which are defined within the credit facility

the credit facility contains events of default based on i the failure to pay when due other debt  the outstanding amount of which exceeds million  after the expiration of applicable grace periods and ii the acceleration of other debt  the outstanding amount of which exceeds million 
we are not in default under our credit facility 
as a result of business operations  we may generate excess cash which could from time to time be used to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to december   but prior to the issuance of the financial statements  we prepaid million on our revolving credit facility 
accordingly  this amount was reclassified as the current portion of notes payable in the consolidated balance sheet at december  at december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness under the five year facility with million available 
the interest rate applied to amounts due under the credit facility was at december  at december   we had approximately million of outstanding indebtedness under the facility with million available 
the interest rate applied to amounts due under the credit facilities was at december  since the interest rate is variable  the recorded balance of the credit facilities approximates fair value 
see note for a discussion of our interest rate swap agreement 
in may  we repaid the million principal amount of our notes at maturity using funds from our revolving credit facility 
subsequently  we had one series of outstanding debt securities  as described below dollar amount in thousands principal amount interest rate maturity february at december  and  the estimated aggregate fair value of these notes was approximately million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices 
on february   we repaid the million principal amount of our notes at maturity using funds from our revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of lease commitments and contracts for sports programming and on air personalities and the guarantee discussed below 
we do not have any majority owned subsidiaries that are not included in our consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any interests in or relationships with any variable interest entities 
in august  we entered into an agreement with salem communications to acquire krtr am formerly khnr am and kkne am formerly khcm am serving the honolulu  hawaii market 
as part of this transaction  we exercised our option to acquire kgmz fm from honolulu broadcasting and exchanged the assets of kgmz fm for the two am stations  valued at million 
this transaction closed in january  and the loan guarantee of million was terminated 
we recognized an aggregate loss on loan guarantee of million related to this transaction 

table of contents in january  we paid million for an option to purchase certain radio stations 
this option is exercisable at any time and expires in december if we have not exercised our option to acquire the stations before july and certain other conditions are met  we may be required to pay additional fees of up to million 
if we exercise the option  the million option price and any additional fees paid to the seller will be applied to the purchase price for the stations 
under certain circumstances specified in the option agreement  we may assign our option for value to a third party 
in february  we agreed to guarantee the borrowings of a third party of up to million to enable that party to purchase two stations and assist us in a signal upgrade project for one of our stations 
this guarantee expires in february if the signal upgrade is approved by the fcc  then we are likely to purchase the stations and performance under the guarantee will not be necessary 
if the signal upgrade is not approved  our guarantee will be extinguished either through sale of the stations or through new financing arranged by the owner of the stations 
we believe that while the value of the stations currently may be insufficient to repay the outstanding debt in full  any shortfall would be immaterial 
at december   the carrying value of this guarantee was million 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations we also have various commitments under the following types of contracts non cancelable operating leases  long term debt  interest payments on long term debt  and other purchase commitments  including contracts for sports programming and on air personalities

we plan to refinance this obligation on a long term basis using proceeds from our revolving credit facility 
amounts due in consist of million due upon and assuming the expiration of the five year credit facility 
these amounts represent estimated future cash interest payments related to debt obligations based on the fixed and variable rates specified in our indenture and credit agreements  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement 
these estimates assume that debt is repaid and not refinanced at maturity 
future interest payments could differ materially from amounts indicated in the table due to future operational and financing needs  market factors and other currently unanticipated events 
these amounts are subject to change if we refinance the million due in on a long term basis as previously noted above 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  there can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse impact on our operating results 
transactions with affiliated companies we receive certain management services from  and have entered into certain transactions with  cox enterprises 
costs of the management services that are allocated to us are based on actual direct costs incurred or on cox enterprises estimate of expenses relative to the management services provided to other subsidiaries of cox enterprises 
we believe that these allocations were made on a reasonable basis  and that receiving these management services from cox enterprises creates cost efficiencies  however  there has been no study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what the cost of obtaining such services from third parties would have been 
the services and transactions described below have been reviewed by our audit committee  which has determined that such services and transactions are fair and in our best interest 
we receive day to day cash management services from cox enterprises  with settlements of outstanding balances between us and cox enterprises occurring periodically at market interest rates 
as a part of these services  cox enterprises transfers funds to cover our checks presented for payment and we record a book overdraft  which is classified as accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheets 
book overdrafts of million and million existed at december  and  respectively  as a result of our checks outstanding 
the amounts due to or from cox enterprises are generally due on demand and represent the net balance of the intercompany transactions 
the rate charged on intercompany borrowing is defined as cox enterprises current commercial paper borrowing rate or a libor based rate and at december  and  respectively  dependent upon our credit rating 
we owed cox enterprises approximately million at december  and cox enterprises owed us approximately million at december  
table of contents we receive certain management services from cox enterprises and its wholly owned subsidiary  cox broadcasting  inc including management and financial advisory services  legal  corporate secretarial  tax  internal audit  risk management  purchasing and materials management  employee benefit including pension plan administration  fleet  engineering and other support services 
expenses allocated for these services are included in corporate general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
we were allocated expenses for the years ended december   and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to these services 
in connection with these management services  we reimburse cox enterprises for payments made to third party vendors for certain goods and services provided to us under arrangements made by cox enterprises on behalf of cox enterprises and its affiliates  including cox radio 
we believe such arrangements allow us to receive such goods and services at more attractive pricing than we would be able to secure separately 
such reimbursed expenditures include insurance premiums for coverage through cox enterprises insurance program  which provides coverage for all of its affiliates  including cox radio 
rather than self insuring these risks  cox enterprises purchases insurance for a fixed premium cost from several insurance companies  including an insurance company indirectly owned by descendants of governor james m

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r originally required adoption no later than july  in april  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a release that amends the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
under the sec s new rule  we will be required to apply sfas no 
r as of january  early adoption was permitted in periods in which financial statements had not yet been issued 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods i a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or ii a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for share based payment awards 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the total impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payment awards granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
upon transitioning to sfas no 
r in january using the modified prospective method  we do not anticipate recognizing a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  however  we do anticipate recognizing compensation expense in in the aggregate amount of approximately million for all share based payment awards granted prior to january  that remain unvested as of january  sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation of an entity to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
such an obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  our adoption of the provisions of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect our adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
we have examined exposures to these risks and concluded that none of the exposures in these areas are material to cash flows or earnings  however  our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to changes in interest rates 
we have engaged in several strategies to manage these market risks 
our indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk 
in connection with each debt issuance and as a result of continual monitoring of interest rates  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement for purposes of managing borrowing costs 
pursuant to the interest rate swap agreement  we have exchanged our floating rate interest obligations on million in notional principal amount of debt for a fixed interest rate 
this agreement has an annual fixed rate of and matures on september  concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in january  we formally designated this agreement as a cash flow hedge as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we are exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreement 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparty  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counterparty s nonperformance 
the estimated fair value of this swap agreement  based on current market rates  approximated a net payable of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the swap agreement at december  is included in other long term liabilities according to the maturity date of the swap 
the market risk for the interest rate swap is mitigated as the variable rate received is hedged to the variable rate paid on the credit facility 
the determination of the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to the effects of interest rate risk 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 

table of contents the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments from million to million at december   and from million to million at december  the estimated fair values of debt instruments are based on discounted cash flow analyses using our borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations 
the revolving credit facilities and cox enterprises borrowings bear interest based on current market rates and  thus  approximate fair value 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to these variable rate debt instruments 
if the borrowing rates under libor were to increase above the current rates at december   our interest expense on the revolving credit facility would increase approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of derivative rate hedging instruments as described above 
with respect to financial instruments  we have estimated the fair values of such instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies that we believe to be appropriate 
considerable judgment  however  is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we would realize or pay in a current market exchange
