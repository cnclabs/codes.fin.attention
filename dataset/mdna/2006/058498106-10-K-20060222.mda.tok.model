item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
ball corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as ball or the company or we and our in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview ball corporation is one of the world s leading suppliers of metal and plastic packaging to the beverage and food industries 
our packaging products are produced for a variety of end uses and are currently manufactured in plants around the world 
we also supply aerospace and other technologies and services to governmental and commercial customers 
we sell our packaging products primarily to major beverage and food producers with which we have developed long term customer relationships 
this is evidenced by our high customer retention and our large number of long term supply contracts 
while we have diversified our customer base  we do sell a majority of our packaging products to relatively few major beverage and food companies in north america  europe and the people s republic of china prc  as do our equity joint ventures in brazil  the us and the prc 
we also purchase raw materials from relatively few suppliers 
because of our customer and supplier concentration  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or supplier or a material change in a supply agreement with a major customer or supplier  although our long term relationships and contracts mitigate these risks 
in the rigid packaging industry  sales and earnings can be improved by reducing costs  developing new products  expanding volume and increasing pricing where possible 
we are in the early stages of a project to upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities  a project that will result in productivity gains and cost reductions 
while the us and canadian beverage container manufacturing industry is relatively mature  the european  prc and brazilian beverage can markets are growing excluding the effects of the german mandatory deposit discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and are expected to continue to grow 
we are capitalizing on the european growth by continuing to reconfigure some of our european can manufacturing lines and by opening in a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade  serbia 
ball s consolidated earnings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we attempt to mitigate this exposure through the use of derivative financial instruments  as discussed in the financial instruments and risk management sections within item a and item  note  of this report 
as part of our packaging strategy  we are focused on developing and marketing new and existing products that meet the ever expanding needs of our beverage and food customers 
these innovations include new shapes  sizes  opening features and other functional benefits of both metal and plastic packaging 
this packaging development activity helps us maintain and expand our supply positions with major beverage and food customers 
the primary customers for the products and services provided by our aerospace and technologies segment are us government agencies or their prime contractors 
it is possible that federal budget reductions and priorities  or changes in agency budgets  could limit future funding and new contract awards or prolong contract performance 
we recognize sales under long term contracts in the aerospace and technologies segment using the cost to cost  percentage of completion method of accounting 
our present contract mix consists of approximately two thirds cost plus contracts  which are billed at our costs plus an agreed upon profit component  and approximately one third fixed price contracts 
we include time and material contracts in the fixed price category because such contracts typically provide for the sale of engineering labor at fixed hourly rates 
throughout the period of contract performance  we regularly reevaluate and  if necessary  revise our estimates of total contract revenue  total contract cost and progress toward completion 
because of contract payment schedules  limitations on funding and other contract terms  our sales and accounts receivable for this segment include amounts that have been earned but not yet billed 
page of management uses various measures to evaluate company performance 
the primary financial measures we use are earnings before interest and taxes ebit  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  diluted earnings per share  economic value added operating earnings after tax  as defined by the company  less a capital charge based on invested capital times our cost of capital  operating cash flow and free cash flow generally defined by the company as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
these financial measures may be adjusted at times for items that affect comparability between periods 
nonfinancial measures in the packaging segments include production spoilage rates  quality control measures  safety statistics and production and shipment volumes 
additional measures used to evaluate performance in the aerospace and technologies segment include contract revenue realization  award and incentive fees realized  proposal win rates and backlog including awarded  contracted and funded backlog 
we recognize that attracting and retaining quality employees is critically important to the success of ball and  because of this  we strive to pay employees competitively and encourage their prudent ownership of the company s common stock 
for most management employees  a meaningful portion of compensation is at risk as an incentive  dependent upon economic value added operating performance 
for more senior positions  more compensation is at risk 
through our employee stock purchase plan and k plan  which matches employee contributions with ball common stock  many employees  regardless of organizational level  have opportunities to participate as ball shareholders 
consolidated sales and earnings the company has determined that it has five reportable segments organized along a combination of product lines and geographic areas north american metal beverage packaging  north american metal food packaging  north american plastic packaging  international packaging and aerospace and technologies 
prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation 
we also have investments in companies in the us  the prc and brazil  which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  and accordingly  their results are not included in segment sales or earnings 
north american metal beverage packaging the north american metal beverage packaging segment consists of operations located in the us  canada and puerto rico  which manufacture metal container products used primarily in beverage packing 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in 
sales were slightly higher in than in as lower sales volumes were offset by higher aluminum prices passed through to our customers 
metal beverage container volumes in were percent below the previous year s levels as a result of poor weather in the first quarter  temporary volume reductions and general softness in the beer and carbonated soft drink markets 
net changes in contracted volumes are expected to result in the restoration of the reduced volumes during and beyond 
sales were percent higher in than in contributing to the increase were the pass through of aluminum price increases and higher volumes in our specialty can products  partially offset by declines in standard ounce can volumes 
sales in improved over due to the million acquisition in march of metal packaging international  inc  a small producer of metal beverage can ends 
based on publicly available information  we estimate that our shipments of metal beverage containers were approximately percent of total us and canadian shipments in we continue to focus efforts on the growing custom beverage can business  which includes cans of different shapes  diameters and fill volumes  and cans with added functional attributes for new products and product line extensions 
the conversion of a manufacturing line in our golden  colorado  plant from ounce to ounce cans was completed in the second quarter of we also announced plans to convert a line in our monticello  indiana  plant from ounce can manufacturing to a line capable of producing beverage cans in sizes up to ounces 
this conversion was substantially completed in january earnings in the segment were million in compared to million in and million in the third quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax related to a project to significantly upgrade and streamline our north american beverage can end manufacturing capabilities 
the charge included the write off of obsolete equipment spare parts and tooling  as well as employee termination costs 
over time  this capital project is expected to result in productivity improvements and reduced manufacturing costs 
page of we have installed the first production module in this multi year project and the second and third modules are in the installation phase 
the project is expected to be completed in also contributing to lower segment earnings in were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges  higher other direct material and utility costs and a million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo last in first out method of accounting 
energy  freight and other direct material costs were million higher in than in  partially offset by efficiency gains  cost controls and lower selling  general and administrative costs in while pricing pressures continue on our raw materials  other direct materials  and freight and utility costs  we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes  as well as preserve our margins 
the improvement in segment earnings in versus was the result of higher sales and production volumes  improved product mix and cost reduction programs 
partially offsetting these earnings improvements was an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo last in first out method of accounting 
in the fourth quarter of  a gain of million was recorded in connection with the sale of a metal beverage container facility that was shut down in december north american metal food packaging the north american metal food packaging segment consists of operations located in the us and canada  which manufacture metal container products used primarily in food packaging 
segment sales in comprised percent of consolidated net sales percent in and were percent higher than sales 
sales in reflected higher prices from the pass through of higher raw material costs 
sales volumes were flat compared to levels including  in the first quarter of  the inclusion of a full quarter s results from our oakdale  california  facility which was acquired in march discussed below 
sales were higher in than in due primarily to the acquisition of the oakdale  california  facility  higher selling prices as a result of the pass through of raw material costs and some pre buying by customers in the fourth quarter of ahead of expected steel price increases 
during and  we were able to pass through the majority of the steel price increases and surcharges levied by steel producers 
we estimate our shipments of billion cans to be approximately percent of total us and canadian metal food container shipments  based on publicly available trade information 
on march   we acquired conagra grocery products company s conagra interest in ball western can company llc ball western can for million 
ball western can  located in oakdale  california  was established in as a joint venture between ball and conagra and  prior to the acquisition  was accounted for by ball using the equity method of accounting 
ball and conagra s parent company  conagra foods inc  signed a long term agreement under which ball provides metal food containers to conagra food packing locations in california 
the acquisition of ball western can added approximately one billion units of annual capacity 
segment earnings were million in compared to million in and million in the fourth quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax for pension  severance and other employee benefit costs related to a reduction in force in our burlington  ontario  plant 
the second quarter of included a pretax charge of million million after tax for the closure of a three piece food can manufacturing plant in quebec 
this action was taken to better match capacity to demand 
the quebec plant was closed and ceased operations in the third quarter of and an agreement has been reached to sell the land and building  which resulted in the second quarter charge being offset by a million gain million after tax in the fourth quarter to adjust the quebec plant to net realizable value 
also contributing to lower segment earnings in were higher freight costs from fuel surcharges  higher other direct material and utility costs and an million increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo last in first out method of accounting 
energy  freight and other direct material costs were million higher in than in  partially offset by efficiency gains  cost controls and lower selling  general and administrative costs in while pricing pressures continue on all of our raw materials  other direct materials  and freight and utility costs  we continue to work with both customers and suppliers to maintain our volumes  as well as preserve our margins 
page of the improvement in earnings in versus was the result of strong fourth quarter food can sales  higher production volumes  improved product mix and cost reduction programs 
in addition  earnings were negatively impacted by million of start up costs associated with a new two piece food can manufacturing line in milwaukee 
partially offsetting these earnings improvements was an increase in cost of sales due to rising raw material costs under the lifo last in first out method of accounting 
in the first quarter of  a net charge of million was booked to record the costs of closing a metal food container plant offset by a gain from the sale of a previously closed plant 
north american plastic packaging the north american plastic packaging segment consists of operations located in the us which manufacture polyethylene terephthalate pet plastic container products used mainly in beverage packaging 
segment sales in comprised percent of consolidated sales percent in and increased percent compared to the sales increase was related to the pass through to our customers of higher resin prices  as well as percent higher sales volumes in compared to  related to higher demand for barrier and heat set containers that provide longer shelf life for products  combined with strong demand for plastic water bottles 
sales in were percent higher than in  primarily as a result of several new preform sales contracts secured during and the pass through of raw material price increases 
carbonated soft drink and water sales volumes in were lower than expected primarily due to reduced demand on the east coast  resulting from competitive pressures  and a delay in the commencement of a new customer supply opportunity on the west coast 
although only a small percentage of our total volume  juice  sports drinks and beer container sales increased in and are expected to grow considerably in the future as more focus is given to these specialty markets and the development of our heat tek tm business 
we estimate our shipments of more than billion bottles to be approximately percent of total us and canadian pet container shipments 
segment earnings were million in compared to million in and million in the improvement in earnings in was the result of higher sales and production volumes and growth in specialty products 
partially offsetting these improvements in were higher utility costs 
segment earnings in and included million and million  respectively  of costs associated with the relocation of the plastics offices and research and development facility from atlanta  georgia  to colorado 
earnings in were also negatively impacted by continued pricing pressures on commodity plastic containers for carbonated soft drink customers 
segment earnings in also included a gain of million as costs related to the shut down and relocation of the atlanta plastics offices were less than expected 
international packaging international packaging includes the production and sale of metal beverage container products manufactured and sold in europe and asia as well as plastic containers manufactured and sold in asia 
this segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in percent in 
ball packaging europe  which represents an estimated percent of the total european metal beverage container manufacturing capacity  has manufacturing plants located in germany  the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  poland and serbia 
european sales were percent higher in than in primarily as a result of an percent increase in sales volumes 
the continued weak demand in germany  as a result of the mandatory deposit legislation previously reported on  is being offset by stronger demand elsewhere in europe  including southern and eastern europe 
sales in were adversely affected by unseasonably cool  wet weather in parts of europe 
european sales were percent higher in than in as a result of a stronger euro  higher selling prices and successful export programs from the german plants to other european countries 
in response to increased demand for custom cans in europe  a steel can manufacturing line in the netherlands was converted to aluminum custom cans during the first quarter of the construction of a new beverage can plant in belgrade  serbia  was completed near the end of the second quarter of to serve the growing demand for beverage cans in southern and eastern europe 
the plant became fully operational during the third quarter of the serbian plant was constructed to accommodate a second can production line and a can end manufacturing module for future growth 
in the first quarter of  a steel can manufacturing line in germany was converted to the production of aluminum cans and  in the first quarter of  one german can manufacturing line was idled 
page of sales in the prc in increased percent over levels  which were percent higher than in the increases were largely the result of higher volumes 
the overall beverage can market in the prc was also strong throughout with expectations of continued growth into we expect demand for aluminum beverage cans to grow in the coming years  as both multinational and chinese beverage fillers expand their markets 
international packaging segment earnings of million in decreased percent compared to earnings of million 
the fourth quarter of included a million gain primarily resulting from the final settlement of all tax obligations related to liquidated china operations for amounts less than originally estimated 
first quarter segment earnings included a million expense for the write off of the remaining carrying value of an equity investment in the prc 
earnings in included income of million related to the realization of proceeds on assets in the prc being in excess of amounts previously estimated  and costs of liquidation being less than anticipated in a business consolidation charge taken in higher material  energy and transportation costs  as well as second and third quarter start up costs related to a line conversion in the netherlands and the new serbia plant had a negative effect on segment earnings 
partially offsetting these higher costs were lower selling  general and administrative costs 
earnings improved in compared to due to a stronger euro and higher profit margins in both europe and the prc due in large part to operational cost reduction programs 
segment earnings in were also improved over by the nonrecurrence of purchase accounting adjustments which increased ball packaging europe s cost of sales in the stronger euro improved our net earnings per diluted share by in compared to during the fourth quarter of  sanshui jianlibao ftb packaging limited sanshui jfp  a percent owned prc joint venture  experienced a greater than customary seasonal production slowdown caused by cash flow difficulties 
after discussions with representatives of the local chinese government  which had temporarily taken control of our joint venture partner s business  we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in respect of sanshui jfp s receivable from the joint venture partner 
our share of the bad debt provision amounted to million and is included in the consolidated statement of earnings as equity in results of affiliates 
information learned late in the first quarter of led the company to record expense of million to write off the remaining carrying value of this investment 
in june we announced a plan to exit the general line metal can business in the prc and reduce our prc beverage can manufacturing capacity by closing two plants 
a million pretax charge million after tax and minority interest impact was recorded in connection with this reorganization 
we recorded earnings of million during  million in and million in as restructuring activities were completed  resulting in realization on assets in excess of amounts previously estimated  as well as costs incurred being less than estimated  including settlement of tax matters 
all costs and transactions related to the prc restructuring have been concluded 
aerospace and technologies aerospace and technologies segment sales represented percent of consolidated net sales percent in and were percent higher than in sales in were percent higher than in the progressively higher sales resulted from a combination of newly awarded contracts and additions to previously awarded contracts 
the aerospace and technologies business won a number of large  strategic contracts and delivered a great deal of sophisticated space and defense instrumentation throughout the three year period 
earnings of million in were percent higher compared to despite an expense of million in the first quarter of for the write down to net realizable value of an equity investment in an aerospace company 
this investment was sold in october for approximately its carrying value 
the improvement in earnings was primarily the result of higher sales and improved program performance 
net earnings decreased in by percent compared to largely due to increased pension costs and higher costs incurred on certain cost plus contracts without corresponding additional fees as these contracts reached completion 
in addition  margins included million due to successfully achieving milestones in two key programs 
page of on july   the deep impact spacecraft accomplished its goal of collecting data from comet tempel  million miles from earth  using an impactor spacecraft to strike the comet and recording the results of the impact with a flyby spacecraft 
the deep impact mission has provided groundbreaking scientific information regarding the origins of the solar system 
some of the segment s other high profile contracts include worldview  an advanced commercial remote sensing satellite  the james webb space telescope  a successor to the hubble space telescope  the space based space surveillance system  which will detect and track space objects such as satellites and orbital debris  npoess  the next generation satellite weather monitoring system  and a number of antennas for the joint strike fighter 
sales to the us government  either directly as a prime contractor or indirectly as a subcontractor  represented percent of segment sales in  percent in and percent of segment sales in the percentage representing us government sales has decreased compared to due to growing revenues related to the worldview contract 
contracted backlog for the aerospace and technologies segment at december  and  was million and million  respectively 
year to year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of the trend of future operations 
for additional information regarding the company s segments  see the summary of business segment information in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
the charges recorded for business consolidation activities were based on estimates by ball management  actuaries and other independent parties and were developed from information available at the time 
if actual outcomes vary from the estimates  the differences will be reflected in current period earnings in the consolidated statement of earnings and identified as business consolidation gains and losses 
additional details about our business consolidation activities and associated costs are provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
expenses in were lower in all areas of the company due largely to lower employee compensation and benefit costs  including the company s deposit share program and economic value added based incentive compensation plans 
in addition  foreign currency hedging gains were higher in than in these lower costs were partially offset by higher pension costs  higher accounts receivable securitization fees and the write down of the prc and aerospace equity investments in the first quarter of the increase in compared to was due to higher costs related to the company s deposit share program  higher pension and incentive costs  costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance in  higher research and development costs  the effects of foreign exchange rates and growth in our aerospace and technologies segment 
in we reduced our us pension plan discount rate from percent to percent  resulting in million higher us pension expense for the year compared to  most of which was included in cost of sales 
in we also reduced our us pension plan discount rate from percent to percent  resulting in million higher us pension expense for the year compared to for the us pension plans  we intend to maintain our current return on asset assumption at percent for while further reducing the discount rate assumption to percent 
based on these assumptions  us pension expense for is anticipated to increase million compared to  most of which will be included in cost of sales 
pension expense in europe and canada combined is expected to be slightly lower than the expense 
a reduction of the plan asset return assumption by one quarter of a percentage point would result in additional expense of approximately million while a quarter of a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in approximately million of additional expense 
additional information regarding the company s pension plans is provided in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
on october   ball s board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of the out of the money  unvested nonqualified stock options granted in april the acceleration affects approximately  options granted to approximately employees at an exercise price of 
the accelerated vesting of these nonqualified options will allow the company to eliminate approximately million of pretax expense approximately million after tax over the next four years 
page of interest and taxes consolidated interest expense was million in  including debt refinancing costs of million  million in and million in  including debt refinancing costs of million 
the progressively lower expense was due to lower average borrowings and higher capitalized interest 
the debt refinancing costs in of million were costs associated with the refinancing of the company s senior credit facilities and the redemption in the last half of of the company s senior notes  which were due in august the debt refinancing costs in of million were associated with the early redemption of the company s senior subordinated notes in august ball s consolidated effective income tax rate for was percent compared to percent in and percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the net tax benefit recorded on the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of jobs act  the tax benefit on business consolidation costs applied at the marginal tax rate  increased research and development tax credits and the manufacturing deduction effective in under the jobs act 
further details of the amounts repatriated under the jobs act are available in note accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
these benefits were somewhat offset by the fact that no tax benefit was provided in respect of the equity investment write downs in the first quarter of the million write down of the aerospace investment is not tax deductible while the realization of tax deductibility of the million prc write down  which will be a capital loss  is not reasonably assured as the company does not have  nor does it anticipate  any capital gains to offset the capital losses 
ball s consolidated effective income tax rate for was percent compared to percent in the overall effective rate was slightly higher  primarily due to higher north american earnings than in  but continues to reflect a low consolidated european income tax rate due to lower profits in germany  reflecting the impact of the refundable mandatory deposit on non refillable containers imposed on january   and a tax holiday in poland 
germany has the highest tax rate of the european countries in which ball has operations 
in connection with the internal revenue service s irs examination of ball s consolidated income tax returns for the tax years through  the irs has proposed to disallow ball s deductions of interest expense incurred on loans under a company owned life insurance plan that has been in place for more than years 
ball believes that its interest deductions will be sustained as filed and  therefore  no provision for loss has been accrued 
the irs s proposed adjustments would result in an increase in taxable income for the years through of million and a corresponding increase in taxable income for subsequent tax years and in the amount of million with a corresponding increase in tax expense of million plus any related penalties and interest expense 
the examination reports for the to examination have been forwarded to the appeals division of the irs  and no further action has taken place to change ball s position 
results of equity affiliates equity in the earnings of affiliates in is primarily attributable to our percent ownership in packaging investments in north america and brazil 
earnings in included the results of a minority owned aerospace business  which was sold in october  and a million loss representing ball s share of a provision for doubtful accounts related to its percent owned interest in sanshui jfp discussed above in international packaging 
after consideration of the prc loss  earnings were million in compared to million in and million in the higher earnings since were primarily due to improved results in our packaging joint ventures in brazil and north america 
page of subsequent event on february   the company entered into a definitive merger agreement in which ball will acquire us can corporation s us can us and argentinean operations for million shares of ball common stock and the assumption of million of us can s debt 
the transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter us can is the largest manufacturer of aerosol cans in the us and also manufactures paint cans  plastic containers and custom and specialty cans in plants in the us aerosol cans are also produced in the two manufacturing plants in argentina 
us can s us and argentinean operations had sales of approximately million unaudited in upon closing the acquisition of us can  the company intends to refinance million of existing us can debt at significantly lower interest rates 
the refinancing will be completed with ball s issuance of a new series of senior notes and an increase in bank debt under the new senior credit facilities put in place in the fourth quarter of critical and significant accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the company s critical and significant policies  as well as recent accounting pronouncements  see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows and capital expenditures cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in the lower amount generated in included million for the payment in january of an accrued withholding tax obligation related to the acquisition of ball packaging europe further discussed below which was funded by the seller at the time of closing by the inclusion of million of additional cash 
management internally uses a free cash flow measure to evaluate the company s operating results  for planning purposes  to evaluate strategic investments and to evaluate the company s ability to incur and service debt 
free cash flow is not a defined term under us generally accepted accounting principles and it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures 
the company defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment capital spending 
free cash flow is typically derived directly from the company s cash flow statements  however  it may be adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods 
an example of such an item excluded in is the million withholding tax payment liability assumed in the acquisition of ball packaging europe in december discussed above 
we believe this is not a comparable free cash flow outflow of the company as it was funded by the seller 
based on this  our consolidated free cash flow is summarized as follows in millions cash flows from operating activities add back withholding tax payment related to the acquisition of ball packaging europe capital spending free cash flow cash flows from operating activities in were negatively impacted by higher cash taxes 
this resulted in a decrease in the deferred income taxes payable of million in compared to an estimated increase in deferred taxes of million in the primary causes of the increase in current income taxes and decrease in deferred income taxes are the reduction in of tax deductible pension costs versus  the impact in of the repatriation of foreign earnings and a reduction of tax versus book depreciation expense as tax depreciation was accelerated in prior years  primarily due to bonus tax depreciation permitted in the tax laws after september  cash flows from operating activities were positively affected in by lower accounts receivable  higher accounts payable and lower pension contributions 
page of cash flow in compared to included higher earnings and higher accounts payable  offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories  as well as higher pension plan contributions 
inventories and accounts payable were higher due to increased purchases of raw materials and accounts receivable were higher partially as a result of strong december food can sales 
based on information currently available  we estimate cash flows from operating activities for to be approximately million  capital spending to be approximately million and free cash flow to be in the million range 
capital spending of million in was above depreciation and amortization expense of million as we invested capital in our best performing operations  including projects to increase custom can capabilities  improve beverage can end making productivity  convert lines from steel to aluminum in europe and complete a new beverage can manufacturing plant in belgrade  serbia  as well as expenditures in the aerospace and technologies segment 
debt facilities and refinancing interest bearing debt at december   decreased million to  million from  million at december  this decrease includes million for net repurchases of common stock and million of capital spending  partially offset by the effects of the lower euro exchange rate and operating cash flow 
on october   ball refinanced its senior secured credit facilities 
the new senior secured facilities extend debt maturities at lower interest rate spreads and provide ball with additional borrowing capacity for future growth 
during the third and fourth quarters of  ball redeemed its senior notes due august primarily through the drawdown of funds under the new credit facilities 
the refinancing and redemption resulted in a pretax debt refinancing charge of million million after tax to reflect the call premium associated with the senior notes and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
the new senior credit facilities  which currently bear interest at variable rates and are due in october  are comprised of the following million term a loan  million term b loan  c million term c loan  a multi currency long term revolving credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of million  and a canadian long term revolving credit facility which provides the company with up to the equivalent of million 
at december   million was available under the multi currency revolving credit facility 
the company also had million of short term uncommitted credit facilities available at the end of the year  of which million was outstanding 
during the first quarter of  ball repaid million million of its previous euro denominated term loan b and reduced the interest rate by basis points 
during the fourth quarter of  ball repaid million of its previous us dollar denominated term loan b and million of its previous euro denominated term loan b 
at the time of the early repayment  the interest rate on the us portion of the term loan b was reduced by basis points 
interest expense during the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of included million and million  respectively  for the write off of the unamortized financing costs associated with the repaid loans 
on august   ball refinanced senior subordinated notes due in through the private placement of million of senior notes due in issued at a price of effective yield to maturity of percent 
in connection with the refinancing of the higher interest debt  in the third quarter of a pretax charge of million was recorded as interest expense  which consisted of the payment of a million call premium and the write off of million of unamortized financing costs 
the company has a receivables sales agreement that provides for the ongoing  revolving sale of a designated pool of trade accounts receivable of ball s north american packaging operations  up to million as of december  million as of december  
the agreement qualifies as off balance sheet financing under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
net funds received from the sale of the accounts receivable totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
page of the company was not in default of any loan agreement at december   and has met all payment obligations 
the us note agreements  bank credit agreement and industrial development revenue bond agreements contain certain restrictions relating to dividends  investments  financial ratios  guarantees and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
additional details about the company s receivables sales agreement and debt are available in notes and  respectively  accompanying the consolidated financial statements within item of this report 
other liquidity items cash payments required for long term debt maturities  rental payments under noncancellable operating leases and purchasing obligations in effect at december   are summarized in the following table payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations a total payments on contractual obligations a the company s purchase obligations include contracted amounts for aluminum  steel  plastic resin and other direct materials 
also included are commitments for purchases of natural gas and electricity  aerospace and technologies contracts and other less significant items 
in cases where variable prices and or usage are involved  management s best estimates have been used 
depending on the circumstances  early termination of the contracts may not result in penalties and  therefore  actual payments could vary significantly 
contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans  not including the unfunded german plans  are expected to be million in this estimate may change based on plan asset performance 
benefit payments related to these plans are expected to be million  million  million  million and million for the years ending december  through  respectively  and million thereafter 
payments to participants in the unfunded german plans are expected to be million  million  million  million and million for the years through  respectively  and a total of million thereafter 
we increased our share repurchase program in to million  net of issuances  compared to million net repurchases in on january   in a privately negotiated stock repurchase transaction  ball entered into a forward purchase agreement to repurchase million of its common shares at an initial price of per share using cash on hand and available borrowings 
the price per share was subject to a price adjustment based on a weighted average price calculation for the period between the initial purchase date and the settlement date 
the company completed its purchase of the million shares at an average price of per share and obtained delivery of the shares in early may on october   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of ball common stock 
this most recent repurchase authorization replaced the previous authorization of up to million shares approved in july  under which approximately million shares remained at october  annual cash dividends paid on common stock were cents per share in  cents per share in and cents per share in total dividends paid were million in  million in and million in page of contingencies the company is subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business due  in part  to the competitive nature of the industries in which we participate  our operations in developing markets outside the us  changing commodity prices for the materials used in the manufacture of our products and changing capital markets 
where practicable  we attempt to reduce these risks and uncertainties through the establishment of risk management policies and procedures  including  at times  the use of derivative financial instruments as explained in item a of this report 
from time to time  the company is subject to routine litigation incident to its business 
additionally  the us environmental protection agency has designated ball as a potentially responsible party  along with numerous other companies  for the cleanup of several hazardous waste sites 
our information at this time does not indicate that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the liquidity  results of operations or financial condition of the company 
due to political and legal uncertainties in germany  no nationwide system for returning beverage containers was in place at the time a mandatory deposit was imposed in january and nearly all retailers stopped carrying beverages in non refillable containers 
during and  we responded to the resulting lower demand for beverage cans by reducing production at our german plants  implementing aggressive cost reduction measures and increasing exports from germany to other countries in the region served by ball packaging europe 
we also closed a plant in the united kingdom  shut down a production line in germany  delayed capital investment projects in france and poland and converted one of our steel can production lines in germany to aluminum in order to facilitate additional can exports from germany 
in the german parliament adopted a new packaging ordinance  imposing a eurocent deposit on all one way glass  pet and metal containers for water  beer and carbonated soft drinks 
as of may   all retailers must redeem all returned one way containers as long as they sell such containers 
major retailers in germany have begun the process of implementing a returnable system for one way containers since they  along with fillers  now appear to accept the deposit as permanent 
the retailers and the filling and packaging industries have formed a committee to design a nationwide recollection system and several retailers have begun to order reverse vending machines in order to meet the may   deadline 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
future events could affect these estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements within item of this report for a summary of the company s critical and significant accounting policies 
the us and european economies and the company have experienced minor general inflation during the past several years 
management believes that evaluation of ball s performance during the periods covered by these consolidated financial statements should be based upon historical financial statements

you are advised  however  to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our k  q and k reports to the securities and exchange commission 
page of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments and risk management in the ordinary course of business  we employ established risk management policies and procedures to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  foreign currencies and prices of the company s common stock in regard to common share repurchases 
although the instruments utilized involve varying degrees of credit  market and interest risk  the counterparties to the agreements are expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements 
we have estimated our market risk exposure using sensitivity analysis 
market risk exposure has been defined as the changes in fair value of derivative instruments  financial instruments and commodity positions 
to test the sensitivity of our market risk exposure  we have estimated the changes in fair value of market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices or rates 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized below 
commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk in connection with market price fluctuations of aluminum primarily by entering into container sales contracts  which generally include aluminum based pricing terms that consider price fluctuations under our commercial supply contracts for aluminum purchases 
such terms generally include a fixed price or an upper limit to the aluminum component pricing 
this matched pricing affects most of our north american metal beverage container net sales 
we also  at times  use certain derivative instruments such as option and forward contracts as cash flow and fair value hedges of commodity price risk where there is not a pass through arrangement in the sales contract 
our north american plastic container sales contracts include provisions to pass through resin cost changes 
as a result  we believe we have minimal  if any  exposure related to changes in the cost of plastic resin 
most north american food container sales contracts either include provisions permitting us to pass through some or all steel cost changes we incur or incorporate annually negotiated steel costs 
in and we were able to pass through the majority of steel surcharges to our customers 
in europe and asia the company manages aluminum and steel raw material commodity price risks through annual and long term contracts for the purchase of the materials  as well as certain sales of containers  that reduce the company s exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices within the current year 
these purchase and sales contracts include fixed price  floating and pass through pricing arrangements 
the company also uses forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges to minimize the company s exposure to significant price changes for those sales contracts where there is not a pass through arrangement 
considering the effects of derivative instruments  the market s ability to accept price increases and the company s commodity price exposures  a hypothetical percent adverse change in the company s metal prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
additionally  if foreign currency exchange rates were to change adversely by percent  we estimate there could be an million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period for foreign currency exposures on the metal 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to fluctuations in prices for utilities such as natural gas and electricity 
a hypothetical percent increase in our utility prices could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates 
page of interest rate risk our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we use a variety of interest rate swaps and options to manage our mix of floating and fixed rate debt 
interest rate instruments held by the company at december  and  included pay fixed and pay floating interest rate swaps 
pay fixed swaps effectively convert variable rate obligations to fixed rate instruments 
the majority of the pay floating swaps  which effectively convert fixed rate obligations to variable rate instruments  are fair value hedges 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   assumed floating rate debt levels throughout and the effects of derivative instruments  a basis point increase in interest rates could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
actual results may vary based on actual changes in market prices and rates and the timing of these changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to protect foreign cash flows and earnings associated with foreign exchange rate changes through the use of cash flow hedges 
in addition  we manage foreign earnings translation volatility through the use of foreign currency options 
our foreign currency translation risk results from the european euro  british pound  canadian dollar  polish zloty  chinese renminbi  brazilian real and serbian dinar 
we face currency exposures in our global operations as a result of purchasing raw materials in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in other currencies 
sales contracts are negotiated with customers to reflect cost changes and  where there is not a foreign exchange pass through arrangement  the company uses forward and option contracts to manage foreign currency exposures 
considering the company s derivative financial instruments outstanding at december   and the currency exposures  a hypothetical percent reduction in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollar could result in an estimated million after tax reduction of net earnings over a one year period 
this amount includes the million currency exposure discussed above in the commodity price risk section 
this hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would also reduce our forecasted average debt balance by million 
actual changes in market prices or rates may differ from hypothetical changes 
sensitivity to foreign currency exposures related to metal increased over prior years due to an increase in metal purchases and related payables at our foreign operations  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations
