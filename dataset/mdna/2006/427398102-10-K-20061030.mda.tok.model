on june  we announced a resumption of the stock repurchase program initially announced in october covering  shares of our common stock and subsequently expanded on may  to cover  shares of common stock 
as of october  we had acquired approximately  shares of common stock under this program of which  shares were acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal at an aggregate cost of approximately results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain financial information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
there can be no assurance that trends in sales growth or operating results will continue in the future 
weeks ended july  july  august  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense  net investment income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fifty two weeks ended july  were approximately million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million 
net sales attributable to the acquisitions of msi and ici completed in the third quarter of fiscal accounted for an increase of approximately million in net sales 
we also experienced an approximate million net increase in sales at our other operations  most significantly as follows o an increase in sales at our lancaster operation of million  which includes million in revenue in connection with a claim due to customer delays and changes in specifications and designs under a major program  as well as an increase of million in the sales of herley medical products 
these increases were offset by reduced sales caused by a reduction in scheduled requirements of f  iff  amraam and meteor programs 
o a net increase in sales at our herley israel operation of approximately million  primarily driven by an increase in development and production of sophisticated microwave integrated assemblies for military use to various international customers 
our level of intercompany sales  which are eliminated in consolidation  increased to million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal the gross profit margin for the fifty two weeks ended july  was as compared to the margin of in fiscal  a decline of 
the decrease in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to the following o development costs on certain contracts in excess of billings to customers 
o engineering costs related to penetration into new military markets 
o the transition of several new programs from engineering development to the early stage of production  with startup costs not yet offset by production revenues 
o the cumulative effects of changes in contract cost estimates on certain programs accounted for under the percentage completion method of accounting 
offset by o higher gross margins contributed by our foreign operations and at recently acquired businesses msi and ici from improved pricing  cost efficiencies  and product mix 
selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended july  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal  or an increase of million 
significant increases during the period included o an increase of approximately million attributable to selling and administrative expenses related to the two acquisitions completed in the third quarter of fiscal msi and ici 
o stock compensation costs of million in connection with the adoption of sfas r as of august  legal expenses in fiscal were million and were primarily attributable to legal costs associated with the investigation and subsequent indictment by the us attorneys office in pennsylvania 
during fiscal  legal costs incurred were million of which million relates to the investigation and the balance relates primarily to the litigation and settlement costs involving robinson laboratories  inc and ben robinson which was settled in fiscal we spent approximately  in out of pocket consulting fees in fiscal versus  in out of pocket consulting fees in fiscal in connection with our sarbanes oxley section compliance program 
the reduction in fees is attributable to our establishment of an internal audit department and the use of internal resources for compliance testing activities 
as a result of the above trends  our operating income for fiscal year was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal our foreign operations contributed  in operating income for the year as compared to  in fiscal revenues from our foreign operations increased by  as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue and operating income within our foreign operations was primarily driven by improved performance at herley israel 
investment income decreased by  in fiscal as a result of a decrease on average of approximately million in excess cash reserves invested  attributable to cash used to fund the acquisitions in fiscal see note b  offset by an increase of in the rate of interest earned on the investment of excess cash reserves and increased operating cash balances during the fiscal year as compared to fiscal the effective income tax rate for both fiscal and was 
the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate of primarily due to net favorable tax benefits 
the largest benefit in was due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign source income  and in due to the recognition of multi year research and development tax credits realized 
other benefits included research and development credits prior to december   tax benefits attributable to extra territorial income ie export sales  the section manufacturing deduction and tax exempt interest income 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fifty two weeks ended july  were approximately  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of approximately million 
net sales at our three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss  msi and ici  accounted for an increase of approximately million  or approximately three quarters of the increase for the fifty two weeks ended july  approximately million of net sales increase is attributable to cti  which was consolidated into our results for only months in fiscal  versus a full months in fiscal in addition to this impact of a full year results for cti  cti has experienced growth of greater than in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  principally due to growth at cti in sales of military products in cti s direct synthesizer products 
other than these acquisition driven impacts  our other divisions experienced a net decline in sales for the year 
the largest decline occurred in our lancaster operation with the decline in versus net sales being primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues from the automatic carrier landing system acls program of million and a reduction of million in foreign sales 
the acls program was awarded in august and included three options over three years 
the third and final option was awarded in june the decline in fiscal year revenue versus fiscal year is attributable to the completion of the second year option in fiscal prior to the award of the third year option which is currently in production 
our uk subsidiary  ewst  experienced a reduction in revenue of approximately million in fiscal versus fiscal  principally due to revisions to and increases in estimated costs to complete certain contracts  which resulted in a reduction in revenue recognized on these contracts 
ewst began to experience technical difficulties under two contracts in which continued into fiscal causing delays in completion of the contracts and costs to increase 
in both cases  the primary reasons for costs increasing were changes in the system design to meet customer specifications which resulted in unanticipated labor and material costs and subsequent adjustments in the costs to complete the projects 
there are no specific market trends or other customer related issues accounting for the fluctuation in foreign revenues other than the timing of orders 
there are no significant changes in the customer base or products sold in fiscal versus fiscal fifty percent of the foreign revenue in fiscal came from three customers 
those same customers accounted for twenty eight percent of foreign revenue in fiscal our level of intercompany sales  which are eliminated in consolidation  increased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal the gross profit margin for the fifty two weeks ended july  was as compared to the margin of in fiscal a decline of 
excluding the impact of our three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss  msi and ici  the decline in gross profit margins would have been larger 
the decrease in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to o the transition of several new programs from engineering development to the early stage of production  with higher engineering costs not yet offset by production revenues 
o decreases of gross margins at ewst  principally due to changes in contract cost estimates at that operation versus contract cost estimates in the prior fiscal year for the same projects 
the changes in contract cost estimates were principally due to unanticipated delays in meeting technical requirements and delivery dates on certain ewst contracts 
offset by o higher margins contributed by signal generation components and direct sources  principally due to the fact that the prior year included only four months of results for cti  which was acquired effective as of march  selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended july  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal  or an increase of million 
large increases during the period included o increases of approximately million attributable to our three acquisitions completed in fiscal rss  msi and ici 
o an increase of approximately million due to the fact that the prior year only included four months of results for cti  which was acquired effective as of march  o an increase of approximately  in legal costs associated with robinson laboratories and the continuing investigation and subsequent indictment by the us attorneys office in pennsylvania 
we spent approximately  in out of pocket consulting fees in fiscal in connection with our sarbanes oxley section compliance program 
as a result of the above trends  our operating income for fiscal year was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales in fiscal our foreign operations contributed  in operating income for the year as compared to  in fiscal revenues from our foreign operations decreased by  as compared to fiscal the drop in revenue and operating income within our foreign operations was due to revisions in total cost estimates at our ewst subsidiary in the uk 
investment income increased by  in fiscal as a result of an increase in the rate of interest earned on the investment of excess cash reserves during the fiscal year as compared to interest rates in fiscal  and a decrease on average of approximately million in funds invested 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was as compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate of in fiscal due to various favorable tax benefits 
the largest benefit was from the recognition of multi year research and development tax credits now being realized 
other benefits included a lower effective tax rate on foreign source income  the us tax benefits attributable to extra territorial income ie export sales and tax exempt interest income 
liquidity and capital resources as of july  and july   working capital was  and  respectively  and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to for each period 
as is customary in the defense industry  inventory is partially financed by progress payments 
in addition  it is customary for us to receive advanced payments from customers on major contracts at the time a contract is entered into 
the un liquidated balance of the progress payments was approximately  at july   and  at july  the balance of advanced payments was approximately  at july   and  at july  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  in fiscal as compared to  in  an increase of approximately million 
income from operations adjusted for depreciation and amortization was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal  an increase of approximately million 
significant items contributing to the net increase in cash provided by operating activities include the following o a reduction of approximately million in the amount of cash invested in costs incurred and income recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the largest impact comes from milestone billings at our ewst facility in o a reduction of approximately million in the amount of cash invested in inventories during fiscal versus fiscal o an increase of approximately million in cash generated through advance payments from customers on contracts during the course of fiscal o an increase of approximately million in cash generated from billings to customers in excess of costs incurred and income recognized on uncompleted contracts during the course of fiscal offset primarily by o a decrease of approximately million in cash generated from collection of accounts receivable during fiscal versus fiscal the increase in cash collections in fiscal resulted from collections for shipments under a major contract at our lancaster facility in connection with an upgrade for us navy aircraft 
this job was largely shipped during fiscal and early in fiscal  which resulted in increased collections of accounts receivable in the first quarter of fiscal trade receivables increased in fiscal generally in relationship to the increase in sales volume 
o a decrease of approximately million resulting from payments to vendors and reductions in accrued expenses 
o a reduction in income taxes payable of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities includes o additional payments of million in connection with the xytrans license of certain technology to be used in missile and millimeter wave products 
see note a o capital expenditures of million including approximately million invested in new equipment to further automate and upgrade our product test facilities 
net cash used in financing activities of million results from the following o proceeds from the exercise of stock options for million 
o the income tax benefit of million in connection with the exercise of stock options 
offset by o the purchase of  shares of treasury stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal for approximately million under a stock repurchase program initially announced in october covering  shares of common stock and subsequently expanded on may  to cover  shares of common stock 
in june  we entered into a new  revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on march  as amended 
we may elect to borrow up to a maximum of  with interest based on the federal funds target rate plus a margin of to  or up to a maximum of  with interest based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement 
the federal funds target rate and the libor rate was and  respectively  at july  there is a fee of basis points per annum on the unused portion of the  libor based portion of the credit facility payable quarterly 
during fiscal  we utilized the credit facility for short term working capital needs to the extent of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the line at july  and july  stand by letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of  under the credit facility at july  we believe that presently anticipated future cash requirements will be provided by internally generated funds  our existing unsecured credit facility and existing cash reserves 
a significant portion of our revenue for fiscal will be generated from our existing backlog of sales orders 
the funded backlog of orders at july  was approximately million 
all orders included in backlog are covered by signed contracts or purchase orders 
nevertheless  contracts involving government programs may be terminated at the discretion of the government 
in the event of the cancellation of a significant amount of government contracts included in our backlog  we will be required to rely more heavily on cash reserves and our existing credit facility to fund our operations 
we are not aware of any events which are reasonably likely to result in any cancellation of our government contracts 
we have approximately  available under our bank credit facility  net of outstanding stand by letters of credit of approximately  and cash reserves at july  of approximately  contractual obligations and commitments our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as purchase orders  and debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments  such as stand by letters of credit are as follows we have outstanding an aggregate of approximately  in open purchase orders as of july  these open purchase orders represent executory contracts for the purchase of goods and services which will be substantially fulfilled in the next six months

critical accounting policies and estimates our established policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies contained in part ii  item of this form k 
as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of our financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
approximately of our customer contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products sold  regardless of the costs incurred 
approximately to of revenues over the last three fiscal years were derived from long term  fixed price contracts for which revenues and estimated profits are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on estimated completion to date the total contract amount multiplied by the percentage of performance  based on total costs incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded in the period when first determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the ultimate costs and contract terms 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
using a fair value approach applied to our one reporting unit 
impairment charges are recognized for amounts where the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
any future impairment of goodwill will be charged to operations 
we amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
amortizable intangible assets may also be tested for impairment if indications of impairment exist 
we obtained a fair market value appraisal of the company by an independent investment banking firm 
based on this appraisal  we have determined that no impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets has occurred at july  provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
since the acquisitions of general microwave corporation and ewst  we are subject to movements in foreign currency rate changes related to our operations in israel and in the uk the movements in the israeli shekel versus the uk dollar have not been significant 
movements in pounds sterling the functional currency at ewst have been more significant 
for the fiscal years  and  ewst accounts for approximately to of our consolidated net sales  based in part on the rate at which ewst s sterling denominated financial statements have been converted into us dollars 
having a portion of our future revenue and income denominated in sterling exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future sterling denominated revenue and earnings 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have increased our consolidated operating income by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss 
the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have increased our consolidated operating income by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss 
the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively 
we have made inter company advances to ewst in the aggregate amount of approximately million at july  that were previously considered long term advances 
since the advances are denominated in us dollars and ewst anticipates reducing the amount of advances during fiscal year  the amount outstanding is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank pursuant to which it exchanged floating rate interest in connection with the bonds discussed in note h of the financial statements on a notional amount of  for a fixed rate of for a ten year period ending october  the notional amount reduces each year in tandem with the annual installments due on the bonds 
the fixing of the interest rate for this period offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates on the bonds  and as such has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and any ineffectiveness will be recognized in interest expense in the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately  as of july  there was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges during the fiscal years presented to be recognized in earnings 
we also have a million revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on march  we may elect to borrow up to a maximum of million with interest based on the federal funds target rate plus a margin of to  or up to a maximum of million with interest based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement
