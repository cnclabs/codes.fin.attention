overview we develop  manufacture and market the invos system  a non invasive patient monitoring system that continuously measures changes in blood oxygen levels in the brain 
we began commercializing our current invos system  which we call the model  internationally in the third quarter of fiscal and in the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal unlike earlier models  the model has the added capability of being able to monitor pediatric patients 
from product launch until the first quarter of fiscal  we focused our marketing efforts primarily on adult and pediatric cardiac surgeries and carotid artery surgeries 
during the second quarter of fiscal  results of both the first prospective  randomized clinical trial and a larger retrospective review evaluating the invos system were presented  which we believe have contributed to the invos system gaining further market penetration 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated selling and marketing efforts for the invos system in the pediatric intensive care unit  or icu 
we plan to launch the product into the neonatal icu in late  after completing development of a smaller somasensor 
we are currently sponsoring a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age following completion of this trial and publication of the results  we intend to target the sale of the invos system for use on diabetic patients undergoing major surgeries 
we expect to begin this marketing in in november  we received k clearance from the fda to market our invos system to monitor changes in somatic tissue blood oxygen saturation in regions of the body other than the brain in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow 
our next generation invos system monitor  which we expect to launch in the first half of  can display information from four somasensors  which will allow for the simultaneous monitoring of changes in blood oxygen saturation in the brain and  in patients with or at risk for restricted blood flow  in somatic tissue 
we also develop and market the correstore system for use in cardiac repair and reconstruction 
in june  we entered into a license agreement for the correstore system 
in november  we received clearance from the fda to market the correstore patch in the united states  and in april we met the requirements under the european medical device directive to use the ce mark  thereby allowing us to market the product in the european economic community 
however  in september  the european economic community changed its regulations  limiting approval authority for animal tissue implant products sold in europe to some independent registration agencies that do not include our registrar 
sales of correstore systems represented two percent of our fiscal net revenues 
we expect that as sales of our invos system increase  the correstore system will become an even less significant component of our business 
net revenues and cost of sales we derive our revenues from sales of invos systems and correstore systems to hospitals in the united states through our direct sales team and independent sales representative firms 
outside the united states  we have distribution agreements with independent distributors for the invos system  including tyco healthcare in europe  
table of contents canada  the middle east and africa  and edwards lifesciences ltd 
in japan 
our cost of sales represent the cost of producing monitors and disposable somasensors 
revenues from outside the united states contributed percent to our fiscal net revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  the gross margins from our international sales are typically lower than gross margins from our us sales  reflecting the difference between the prices we receive from distributors and from direct customers 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the product is considered delivered to the customer once we have shipped it  as this is when title and risk of loss have transferred 
payment terms are generally net days for us sales and net days or longer for international sales 
our invos system revenues are derived from the sale of monitors and our disposable somasensors 
we intend that disposables will form the basis of a recurring revenue stream 
we expect the percentage of revenue from disposables to increase over time as our installed base of monitors grows 
we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the monitor 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years  and this depreciation is included in cost of goods sold 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses generally consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our employees and consultants  sales and marketing expenses  such as employee sales commissions  commissions to independent sales representatives  travel  entertainment  advertising  education and training expenses  depreciation of demonstration monitors and attendance at selected medical conferences  clinical research expenses  such as costs of supporting clinical trials  and general and administrative expenses  such as the cost of corporate operations  professional services  insurance  warranty and royalty expenses  investor relations  depreciation and amortization  facilities expenses and other general operating expenses 
we have increased the size of our direct sales team from persons at the end of fiscal to persons at the end of fiscal we expect to increase significantly the size of our us direct sales team in fiscal and are evaluating placing direct salespersons and clinical specialists in europe to support tyco healthcare 
we also expect our clinical research expenses to increase in fiscal as a result of sponsoring a clinical trial evaluating the use of the invos system on diabetic patients over age as a result  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal research  development and engineering expenses consist of salaries  wages and related expenses of our research and development personnel and consultants  costs of various development projects  and costs of preparing and processing applications for fda clearance of new products 
deferred tax assets and impairment charges as of november   we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of  as a result of expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of  for the fiscal year ended november  
table of contents we recorded an impairment expense of  associated with the write down of our intangible asset associated with the acquisition of the license for the correstore system 
we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets due to expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of results of operations fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  net revenues 
our net revenues increased  or percent  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in us sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in us sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of  or percent  as a result of a percent increase in somasensor unit sales and a percent increase in somasensor average selling prices 
this increase in our average selling prices is attributable to the addition of new customers at our higher suggested retail prices and increased sales of our pediatric somasensor which sells for a higher price than the adult somasensor 
in addition  sales of the invos system monitor in the united states increased  or percent  primarily as a result of increased purchases by pediatric hospitals after the launch of our products into the pediatric icu in the first quarter of fiscal  and an increase in international sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased purchases of the invos system monitor and disposable somasensor by tyco healthcare in europe  which was partially offset by decreased purchases by edwards lifesciences in japan 
in fiscal  international sales represented percent of our net revenues  compared to percent of our net revenues in fiscal purchases by tyco healthcare accounted for percent of net revenues in fiscal in the united states  we sold  somasensors in fiscal  and internationally  we sold  somasensors in fiscal we placed invos system monitors in the united states and internationally in fiscal  and our installed base of invos system monitors in the united states was approximately  in hospitals  as of november  sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows fiscal year ended november  product somasensors invos system monitors total invos system correstore systems total effective december   we increased the suggested list price of the adult somasensor and the pediatric somasensor in the united states to and  respectively 
although these prices may not apply to existing customers or to any existing sales quotations issued before the price increase was effective  we expect that the average selling price of somasensors in the united states will increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of the addition of new customers at our suggested retail prices and increased sales of our pediatric somasensor 

table of contents gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was percent for the fiscal year ended november  and percent for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in the average selling price of somasensors in the united states and increased sales of the invos system monitors to pediatric hospitals in the united states research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses increased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to development costs associated with our next generation invos system monitor  scheduled to be launched in the first half of we expect our research  development and engineering expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional research and development personnel 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november   primarily due to a percent increase in our sales and marketing expenses during fiscal because of our increased sales personnel and our increased sales and marketing efforts 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in salaries  wages and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally in sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november   an impairment expense of  as a result of the write down of our intangible asset associated with the acquisition of the license for the correstore system  an  increase in employee sales commissions as a result of increased sales and increased sales personnel during fiscal  an  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of increased sales  a  increase in travel and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales personnel and increased sales and marketing activities  a  increase in audit related expenses  primarily as a result of costs associated with our first internal control assessment under section of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations  a  increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to our fiscal financial performance  primarily increased sales and net income  in accordance with the incentive compensation plan  and a  increase in employer k matching contributions as a result of increased personnel and increased salaries and wages as described above 
during fiscal we incurred  of expenses as a result of the termination of some of our independent sales representative firms 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal  primarily as a result of our hiring additional direct sales personnel in fiscal and  increased sales commissions payable to our independent sales representative firms  increased clinical research expense  and increased sales and marketing expenses 
income tax benefit 
as of november   we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of additional deferred tax assets as a result of expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this additional deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal of  and increased our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
as progresses and we assess our plans for future years  we will continue to review the appropriateness of adjusting our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and recognizing additional deferred tax assets 

table of contents fiscal year ended november  compared to fiscal year ended november  net revenues 
our net revenues increased  or percent  from  in the fiscal year ended november  to  in the fiscal year ended november  the increase in net revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in us sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in us sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of the disposable somasensor of  or percent  as a result of a percent increase in somasensor unit sales and a percent increase in somasensor average selling prices 
this increase in our average selling prices is attributable to the addition of new customers at our higher suggested retail prices  which were effective september   increased sales of our small adult somasensor that was launched in the third quarter of fiscal and sells for a premium price compared to the adult somasensor  increased sales of our pediatric somasensor which also sells for a higher price than the adult somasensor  and the upgrade of certain customers to our most recent model invos system monitor in exchange for the customer agreeing to pay a higher price for the disposable somasensor 
in addition  sales of the invos system monitor in the united states increased  or percent  as a result of increased purchases by pediatric hospitals 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in correstore system revenues of  or percent  and an increase in international sales of  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased purchases of the invos system monitor and disposable somasensor by edwards lifesciences in japan  which was partially offset by decreased purchases by tyco healthcare in europe 
in fiscal  international sales represented percent of our net revenues  compared to percent of our net revenues in fiscal purchases by tyco healthcare accounted for percent of net revenues in fiscal in the united states  we sold  somasensors in fiscal we placed invos system monitors in the united states and internationally in fiscal  and our installed base of invos system monitors in the united states was approximately  in hospitals  as of november  sales of our products as a percentage of net revenues were as follows fiscal year ended november  product somasensors invos system monitors total invos system correstore systems total gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was percent for the fiscal year ended november  and percent for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues is primarily attributable to a change in the sales mix with increased sales of the disposable somasensor  which has a higher gross margin percentage than the invos system monitor or correstore system  the increase in the average selling price of somasensors  a significant reduction in the cost of our somasensor in may as a result of changes in our manufacturing process  and the change in sales mix with increased sales in the united states  which have higher gross margins than our international sales to distributors 
research  development and engineering expenses 
our research  development and engineering expenses decreased  or percent  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease 
table of contents is primarily attributable to  in decreased costs associated with the development of the correstore system and  in decreased costs associated with the development of the invos system monitor  partially offset by increased costs associated with the development of the disposable somasensor and increased engineering salaries 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or percent  from  for the fiscal year ended november  to  for the fiscal year ended november  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a  increase in salaries  wages and related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of employees  principally in sales and marketing from an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november  to an average of employees for the fiscal year ended november   a  increase in employee sales commissions as a result of increased sales and increased sales headcount during fiscal  a  increase in commissions paid to our independent sales representative firms as a result of increased sales  a  increase in accrued incentive compensation expense due to our fiscal financial performance  primarily increased sales and net income  in accordance with the incentive compensation plan  a  increase in travel and selling related expenses as a result of our increased sales headcount and increased sales and marketing activities   in costs associated with a k matching contribution program that we implemented in fiscal  and  in costs associated with the termination of some of our independent sales representative firms in the second quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in customer education expenses for the correstore system 
income tax benefit 
as of november   we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of  as a result of expected future tax benefits related to our net operating loss carryforwards 
recognition of this deferred tax asset resulted in a non cash tax benefit on our statement of operations for fiscal  and increased our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in the past three years 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal sources of operating funds have been the proceeds of equity investments from sales of our common shares and  in fiscal years and  cash provided by operating activities 
see statements of shareholders equity of our financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus 
as of november   we did not have any outstanding or available debt financing arrangements  we had working capital of million and our primary source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents 
pending their ultimate use  we currently invest our available funds in bank savings accounts 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at november  will be adequate to satisfy our operating and capital requirements for more than the next twelve months 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by used in operations during fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash was provided primarily by  of net income before income taxes  non cash intangible impairment expense  and non cash depreciation and amortization expense  a  increase in accrued liabilities  primarily as a result of the increased accrued incentive compensation and accrued sales commissions as a result of our fiscal financial performance  partially offset by reduced accrued k matching contributions as of the end of the fiscal year and decreased accrued professional fees  and a  increase in accounts payable  primarily as a result of increased inventory and operating expenses  partially offset by more timely payments made to vendors 
cash provided by operations in fiscal was partially offset by a  increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal than in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the timing of more of the sales in fiscal towards the end of the fourth quarter  a  increase in inventories  primarily due to the acquisition of somasensors and components associated with our invos system monitor due to anticipated sales  inventories on our balance sheet increased less because we capitalized invos system monitors to property and equipment that are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment  as described below  and a  increase in prepaid expenses  primarily due to the timing of the renewal of our product liability and general liability insurance policies  and increased prepaid expenses for trade shows and marketing programs 
we expect our working capital requirements to increase as sales increase 
the increase in inventories described above is greater than shown on our balance sheet because it includes invos system monitors that we capitalized because they are being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment 
we capitalized approximately  of costs from inventory for invos system monitors being used as demonstration units and no capital cost sales equipment at customers during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal as of november   we have capitalized  in costs for invos system monitors being used as demonstration and no capital cost sales equipment  and these assets have a net book value of  we depreciate these assets over five years

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement revises statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements 
in november  we approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options as of november  the primary purpose of this accelerated vesting was to eliminate compensation expense we would recognize in our results of operations upon the adoption of sfas r  which is effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  after the effects of the accelerated vesting  the initial adoption of sfas r is expected to be immaterial 
however  the issuance of additional stock compensation under the stock incentive plan in future years will have an additional impact on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe our most significant accounting policies relate to the recording of an intangible asset for license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories  our accounting treatment of stock options issued to employees  our accounting treatment for income taxes  and our revenue recognition associated with our no capital cost sales program 
correstore intangible asset in fiscal years  and  we recorded an intangible asset related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories 
license acquisition costs include our estimate of the fair value of ten year vested stock options to purchase common shares granted to one of our directors in connection with negotiating and assisting us in completing the transaction  and our estimate of the fair value of the vested portion of five year warrants to purchase common shares issued in the transaction 
consistent with the treatment of the vested warrants to purchase common shares  we intend to include in license acquisition costs  and additional paid in capital  the fair value of the vested portion of the unvested warrants to purchase common shares  estimated using the black scholes valuation model  when and if they become vested 
however  we do not expect any of these remaining warrants to become vested before their november  expiration date  based on sales of correstore products to date 

table of contents we estimated the value of the stock options to purchase common shares and the vested warrants to purchase common shares using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires the following assumptions expected life period of the security  expected volatility of our stock price during the period  risk free interest rate  and dividend yield 
given the assumptions inherent in the black scholes valuation model  it would have been possible to calculate a different value for our intangible asset by changing one or more of the valuation model variables or by using a different valuation model 
however  we believe that the model is appropriate  that the judgments and assumptions that we have made at the time of valuation were also appropriate  and that the reported results would not be materially different had one or more of the variables been different or had a different valuation model been used 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the effect of adopting this statement has been to discontinue amortizing our license acquisition costs related to our acquisition of exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing licenses to specified rights relating to the correstore system and related products and accessories described above because we believe these licenses have an indefinite life 
therefore  we recorded no amortization expense related to these license acquisition costs in fiscal  or it is possible to determine a different life for these licenses  and if they had a definite life  we would amortize the intangible asset over the remaining useful life 
however  we believe it is appropriate to use an indefinite life for these licenses 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment at the end of our fiscal year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered 
we evaluate impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset  determined using a cash flow method  with its carrying value 
in november  we wrote off the remaining correstore license acquisition cost intangible asset  and recorded an impairment expense of  we wrote this off based on the cash flow impairment analysis that was performed  the declining sales of correstore products and the uncertainty regarding future prospective  randomized clinical data 
management does not expect net positive future cash flow from the correstore product for the foreseeable future 
employee stock options in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including stock options  stock appreciation rights and restricted stock be recognized in the financial statements 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  we currently account for stock based compensation of employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation costs for stock options granted to employees are measured as the excess  if any  of the market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
no compensation expense has been charged against income for fiscal  and for stock option grants to employees because our stock option grants are priced at the market value as of the date of grant 
in november  we approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options as of november  the primary purpose of this accelerated vesting was to eliminate compensation expense we would recognize in our results of operations upon the adoption of sfas r  which is effective for our fiscal quarter beginning december  after the effects of the accelerated vesting  the initial adoption of sfas r is expected to be immaterial 
the issuance of additional stock compensation under the stock incentive plan in future years will have an additional impact on our financial statements 
stock based compensation of consultants and advisors is determined based on the fair value of the options or warrants on the grant date pursuant to the methodology of sfas no 
 estimated using the black scholes model 
the resulting amount is recognized as compensation expense and an increase in additional paid in capital over the vesting period of the options or warrants 
as a result  we recorded  of compensation expense  and 
table of contents an equal increase in additional paid in capital  for stock options vesting in favor of non employees in fiscal  and  of compensation expense in fiscal during fiscal  we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors  and in fiscal we granted  stock options to our employees and directors 
had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options that vested in fiscal using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded  in compensation expense and realized pro forma net income of  or per diluted common share 
for fiscal  had we recognized compensation expense for our stock options that vested in fiscal  using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded  in compensation expense and realized pro forma net income of  or per diluted common share 
for fiscal  had we recognized compensation expense for stock options that vested in fiscal  using the fair value method of accounting based on the fair value of the options on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  we would have recorded  in compensation expense and incurred a pro forma net loss of  or per diluted common share 
income taxes we have performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding realization of our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
 including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses over our history up to the most recent three fiscal years  and our forecast for future net income 
our assessment of our deferred tax assets  and the reversal of part of our valuation allowance  included assuming that our net revenues and pre tax income will grow in future years consistent with the growth guidance given for fiscal and making allowance for the uncertainties surrounding  among other things  our future rate of growth in net revenues  the rate of adoption of our products in the marketplace  and the potential for competition to enter the marketplace 
in reversing a portion of our valuation allowance  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized 
during fiscal  we adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of  related to the expected future benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during fiscal  we further adjusted our deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of an additional net deferred tax asset of  the effect of recognizing this asset on our balance sheet  and associated tax benefit on our statement of operations  is to increase our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share  and to increase our net income for fiscal to  or per diluted common share 
given the assumptions inherent in our financial plans  it is possible to calculate a different value for our deferred tax asset by changing one or more of the variables in our assessment 
however  we believe that our evaluation of our financial plans was reasonable  and that the judgments and assumptions that we made at the time of developing the plan were appropriate 
no capital cost sales revenue recognition we offer to our customers in the united states a no capital cost sales program whereby we ship the invos system monitor to the customer at no charge 
under this program  we do not recognize any revenue upon the shipment of the invos system monitor 
we recognize somasensor revenue when we receive purchase orders and ship the product to the customer 
at the time of shipment of the monitor  we capitalize the invos system monitor as an asset and depreciate this asset over five years 
we believe this is consistent with our stated revenue recognition policy  which is compliant with staff accounting bulletin no 
and emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables
