overview we are a global information technology  or it  supply chain services company 
we offer a comprehensive range of services to it original equipment manufacturers and software publishers  collectively oems  and reseller customers worldwide 
the supply chain services that we offer include product distribution  related logistics and support services  contract assembly and demand generation marketing 
we have been in the it distribution business since and are one of the largest it product distributors based on reported revenue 
we focus our core wholesale distribution business on a limited number of leading it oems  which allows us to enhance and increase the value we provide to our oem suppliers and reseller customers 
because we offer distribution  contract assembly  demand generation marketing  it solutions and complementary supply chain services  oem suppliers and resellers can outsource to us multiple areas of their business outside of their core competencies 
this model allows us to provide services at several points along the it product supply chain 
we believe that the combination of our broad range of supply chain capabilities  our focus on serving the leading it oems and our efficient operations enables us to realize strong relationships with our oem suppliers and reseller customers 
we are headquartered in fremont  california and have distribution  sales and assembly facilities in asia  europe and north america 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software and networking equipment  and  to a lesser extent  from contract assembly 
we recognize revenue in both our distribution and contract assembly operations as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
our distribution sales are made to reseller customers on a purchase order basis and generally relate to a specific order from a reseller s end user customer 
our contract assembly sales are generated from specific purchase orders received from our oem customers for a specified unit quantity 
we generally do not have long term sales agreements with our reseller or contract assembly customers 

table of contents revenue from our distribution business represented approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in our distribution business  our primary customers are resellers 
none of our reseller customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal  or approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products 
most of our remaining revenue is derived from the distribution and assembly of the it products of a relatively small number of other suppliers 
approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively  was derived from our contract assembly business 
we provide contract assembly services primarily to it product oems 
our contract assembly revenue is dependent on a small number of customers 
revenue from contract assembly provided to sun microsystems accounted for less than of our total revenue in fiscal and and approximately of our total revenue in sun accounted for approximately of our contract assembly revenue in fiscal and the market for it products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our distribution business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute 
from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
a significant portion of our cost of distribution revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  and freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory 
our contract assembly cost of revenue consists primarily of cost of materials  labor and overhead 
margins the it product distribution and contract assembly industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated between and annually over the past three years due to changes in the mix of products we sell  customers we sell to  competition  seasonality and the general economic environment 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin has also fluctuated between and annually over the past three years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
recent acquisitions and divestitures we seek to augment our organic growth with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our supply chain service capabilities 
we also divest businesses that we deem not strategic to our ongoing operations 
our historical acquisitions have brought us new reseller customers and oem suppliers  extended the geographic reach of our operations  particularly in international markets  and expanded the services we provide to our oem suppliers and customers 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and include acquired entities within our consolidated financial statements from the closing date of the acquisition 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended november   we did not make any acquisitions and divested two of our subsidiaries  synnex kk and emj america 
in may  we sold approximately of the equity in synnex kk  our japan subsidiary  to mcj company limited  or mcj  a japan based public company 
we sold our japan distribution business  as it was not strategic to our current north american focused distribution and assembly business model 
we received shares of mcj stock as consideration for synnex kk we are restricted from selling the mcj stock until one year after the sale date 
as a result of this equity investment  we must record the gains or losses in our investment each period based on the closing price of mcj stock 
these non operating gains or losses are reported in other income expense  net 
in order to reduce the risk of holding the mcj shares  we have entered into several forward contracts to sell mcj shares for a fixed price in april as of november   such contracts covered of the mcj shares held by the company 
in june  we sold the operations of our emj america subsidiary to the management team of emj america 
emj america was a subsidiary of our canadian based subsidiary emj data systems limited  or emj  and was not in the same business as emj 
the operations of our emj america subsidiary were not material to us 
economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for the it products that we distribute and assemble 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on unpaid amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in interest expense and finance charges  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the plan allows for the participants to direct investment of deferred amounts in equity securities 
these equity investments are classified as trading securities 
gaap requires that gains losses on the deferred compensation equity securities be recorded in other income expense  net and that an equal amount be charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
deferred compensation expense was million in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal unearned stock based compensation in prior years  in connection with the granting of employee stock options that had exercise prices determined to be below fair market value on the date of grant and restricted stock awards  we have recorded unearned stock based compensation 
unearned stock based compensation represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes on the date of grant and either the exercise price of stock options or the fair market value of restricted stock awards  as the case may be 
unearned stock based compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the applicable stock options or restricted stock awards  generally five years  using the straight line method 
our stock based compensation expense relates to stock options granted to individuals and is reflected in cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
at november   the balance of the unearned stock based compensation was million  due to the issuance of restricted stock 
at november   there was no unearned stock based compensation balance 
stock based compensation expense was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal 
table of contents seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it products industry 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
insurance coverage although from time to time we have experienced incidents of theft at various facilities  in fiscal and fiscal we experienced theft as a result of break ins at four of our warehouses in which approximately million of inventory was stolen 
based on our investigation  discussions with local law enforcement and meetings with federal authorities  we believe the thefts at our warehouses were part of an organized crime effort that targeted a number of technology equipment warehouses throughout the united states 
as a result of the losses in  we reduced our inventory value by million  and recorded estimated proceeds  net of deductibles as a receivable from our insurance company  included within other current assets on our balance sheet as of november  in january we received a final settlement from our insurance company that amounted to substantially all of the receivable recorded as of november  in march  approximately million of inventory was stolen from our facility in the city of industry  california 
we subsequently recovered approximately million through law enforcement and federal authorities 
we filed a claim with our insurance provider for the amount of the loss  less a small deductible 
we have received substantially all of the claimed amount 
these types of incidents may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain theft coverage in the future 
there is no assurance that future incidents of theft will not re occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  intangible assets and other long lived assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  which may result in the impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in estimating our allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of our receivable portfolio  our continuing credit evaluation of our customers financial conditions  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and collateral requirements from our customers in certain circumstances 

table of contents oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
inventory price protection and product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  if market conditions were to deteriorate due to an economic downturn  oem suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause an impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
contingencies and litigation 
there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against us incident to our operations 
if a loss arising from these actions is probable and can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range within which no point is more probable than another 
based on current available information  we believe that the ultimate 
table of contents resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as additional information becomes available  we assess any potential liability related to these actions and may need to revise our estimates 
future revisions of our estimates could materially impact the results of our operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the indicated periods  data as percentages of revenue fiscal years ended november  statements of operations data revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from continuing operations before non operating items  income taxes and minority interest interest expense and finance charges  net other income expense  net income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in subsidiaries income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal years ended november  and revenue 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands revenue distribution revenue contract assembly revenue the increase in our distribution revenue was mostly attributable to increased demand for products through the it distribution channel  primarily in the united states  and the acquisition of emj in september our revenue increase was also a result of our increased selling and marketing efforts and increased sales to direct marketers  government vars and retail customers 
the increase in our distribution revenue was somewhat mitigated by continued significant competition in the it distribution marketplace  our desire to focus on operating income growth before revenue growth and gradual declines in the average selling price of the products we sell 
the decrease in contract assembly revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in demand from our largest contract assembly customer  sun microsystems as well as a decrease in the average selling prices for the products we assemble 
this decrease in demand was primarily due to product life cycles and product transitions currently ongoing for the products we assemble for sun microsystems 

table of contents gross profit 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue our gross profit has been affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products we sell and the mix of customers to whom we sell  rebate and discount programs from our suppliers  freight costs and reserves for inventory losses 
the increase in gross profit percentage was a result of higher margins in our distribution segment  mainly due to improvements in our north american pricing initiatives as well as customer and product mix and the emj acquisition 
our contract assembly gross profit percentage increased slightly due to changes in product and customer mix 
while we currently expect that our total gross margin percentage will be relatively stable from fiscal levels  our gross margins may decrease in future periods as a result of the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue  distribution customer mix  as well as due to potential increased competition  softness in the overall economy or changes to the terms and conditions in which we do business with our oems 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
year ended november  year ended november  change in thousands in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  product marketing  distribution and contract assembly operations and administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include stock based compensation expense  deferred compensation expense or income  temporary personnel fees  the costs of our facilities  utility expense  professional fees  depreciation expense on our capital equipment and amortization expense on our intangible assets  offset by reimbursements from oem suppliers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from the prior year  and  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal to from in the prior year 
the increase  on a dollar basis  was primarily the result of incremental expenses associated with our increased revenue in the united states  the emj acquisition in september  a million increase in deferred compensation expense and continued investments in new business initiatives 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to a million restructuring charge incurred in the year ended november  in our canadian distribution segment 
the restructuring charge was primarily incurred to eliminate duplicate personnel and excess facilities that occurred as a result of our acquisition of emj 
the restructuring resulted in employee termination benefits of million  estimated facilities exit expenses of million and other costs of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses  on a percentage of revenue basis  remained constant from the prior year after adjusting for the additional costs related to deferred compensation expense  restructuring charges and investments in new business initiatives 
netted against selling  general and administrative expenses are reimbursements from oem suppliers of million for fiscal  compared to million in the prior year 
the reimbursements relate to marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs such as advertisements in trade publications  direct marketing campaigns through mail and e mail and product demonstrations at trade shows 
we make the arrangements and pay for the advertising  facility fees and other costs of the programs  which feature the oem suppliers products 

table of contents while we continually strive to maintain the lowest possible cost structure in running our operations  we do expect that our selling  general and administrative expense will increase in future periods if we continue to grow our revenues  due to the incremental costs associated with increased revenues

our distribution operating income percentage decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year primarily due to our restructuring charges in the first and third quarters of fiscal and a million increase in deferred compensation expense 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in the operating loss of our mexico operation 
while the increase in deferred compensation expense had an effect on operating income  there was no effect on net income as the increase in deferred compensation expense was offset by an investment gain  which is recorded in other income expense  net 
the decrease in the operating loss in mexico was a result of focused efforts to reduce costs and improve operating effectiveness 
our contract assembly operating income percentage did not significantly change from fiscal to the prior year 
interest expense and finance charges  net

the increase in interest expense and finance charges  net was a result of higher finance charges due to higher interest rates as compared to those in and higher debt levels due to the emj acquisition as well as to finance increased revenue  million associated with our new securitization borrowing facility in canada and million related to the repayment of debt resulting from the acquisition of emj

our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we rely heavily on debt  accounts receivable flooring programs and the sale of our accounts receivable under our securitization programs for our working capital needs

the primary uses of cash have been to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from increased sales  and for acquisitions 
we had positive net working capital of and million at november  and  respectively 
we believe that cash flows from operations  our current cash balance and funds available under our working capital and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
to increase our market share and better serve our customers  we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions 
we expect that this expansion would require an initial investment in personnel  facilities and operations  which may be more costly than similar investments in current operations 
as a result of these investments  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and operating expenses that is disproportionate to revenue from those operations 
these investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by incurring additional debt or issuing common stock

off balance sheet arrangements we have a six year revolving accounts receivable securitization program in the united states  which provides for the sale of up to million of us trade accounts receivable to two financial institutions 
the program expires in august in connection with this program substantially all of our us trade accounts receivable are transferred without recourse to our wholly owned subsidiary  which  in turn  sells the accounts receivable to the financial institutions 
sales of the accounts receivables to the financial institutions under this program result in a reduction of total accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining accounts receivable not sold to the financial institutions are carried at their net realizable value  including an allowance for doubtful accounts 
our effective borrowing cost under the program is the prevailing commercial paper rate of return plus per annum 
at november  and  the amount of our accounts 
table of contents receivable sold to and held by the financial institutions under this accounts receivable securitization program totaled million and million  respectively 
the program contains customary financial covenants  including  but not limited to  requiring us to maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter in each fiscal year ending on or after november  of not less than i the minimum net worth required under the arrangement for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus ii an amount equal to of the positive net income of us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus iii an amount equal to of the amount of any equity raised by or capital contributed to us during the immediately preceding fiscal year  a fixed charge ratio for each rolling period from and after the closing of the arrangement of not less than to 
the fixed charge ratio is the ratio of ebitda for the rolling period ending on such date to fixed charges for such period 
fixed charges means  with respect to any of our fiscal periods a cash interest expense during such period  plus b regularly scheduled payments of principal on our debt other than debt owing under the amended arrangement  as defined paid during such period  plus c the aggregate amount of all capital expenditures made by us during such period  plus d income tax expense during such period  plus e any dividend  return of capital or any other distribution in connection with our capital stock 
rolling period means as of the end of any or our fiscal quarters  the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters including the fiscal quarter then ending  and with respect to our wholly owned subsidiary  a net worth percentage of not less than 
we also entered into a one year revolving accounts receivable securitization program in canada through synnex canada limited in november which provides for the sale of up to c million of us and canadian trade accounts receivable to a financial institution 
the program expires in november in connection with this program all of synnex canada limited s us and canadian trade accounts receivable will be sold to the financial institution on a fully serviced basis 
sales of the accounts receivables to the financial institution under this program result in a reduction of total accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet 
our effective discount rate under the program is the prevailing bankers acceptance rate of return or prime rate in canada plus per annum 
at november  the amount of our accounts receivable sold to and held by the financial institutions under this accounts receivable securitization program totaled million 
the program contains customary financial covenants  including  but not limited to  requiring us to maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum net worth at the end of each fiscal quarter in each fiscal year ending on or after november  of not less than i the minimum net worth required under the arrangement for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus ii an amount equal to of the positive net income of us and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for the immediately preceding fiscal year plus iii an amount equal to of the amount of any equity raised by or capital contributed to us during the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we believe that available funding under our accounts receivable financing programs provides us increased flexibility to make incremental investments in strategic growth initiatives and to manage working capital requirements  and that there are sufficient trade accounts receivable to support the us and canadian financing programs 
as we have in prior periods  we expect we will increase these programs if our revenue levels continue to increase 
under these programs  we continue to service the accounts receivable  and receive a service fee from the financial institutions for the us financing program 
we are also obligated to provide periodic financial statements and investment reports  notices of material litigation and any other information relating to our us trade accounts receivable as requested by the financial institutions 
as is customary in trade accounts receivable securitization arrangements  a credit rating agency s downgrade of the third party issuer of commercial paper or of a back up liquidity provider which provides a source of funding if the commercial paper market cannot be accessed could result in an adverse change or loss 
table of contents of our financing capacity under these programs if the commercial paper issuer or liquidity back up provider is not replaced 
loss of such financing capacity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have also issued guarantees to certain vendors of our subsidiaries for the total amount of million as of november  and million as of november  we are obligated under these guarantees to pay amounts due should our subsidiaries not pay valid amounts owed to their vendors or lenders 
the vendor guarantees are typically less than one year arrangements  with day cancellation clauses and the lender guarantees are typically for the term of the loan agreement 
on balance sheet arrangements we have a senior secured revolving line of credit arrangement  or the revolver  with a group of financial institutions  which is secured by our inventory and expires in the revolver s maximum commitment is of eligible inventory valued at the lower of cost or market  less liquidation reserve as defined up to a maximum borrowing of million 
interest on borrowings under the revolver is based on the financial institution s prime rate or libor plus at our option 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver at november  or our subsidiary  synnex canada  had a revolving loan agreement with a financial institution with a credit limit of c million 
borrowings under the loan agreement were collateralized by substantially all of synnex canada s assets  including inventories and accounts receivable 
the balance outstanding at november  was million 
this agreement was terminated in fiscal we have other lines of credit and revolving facilities with financial institutions  which provide for borrowing capacity aggregating approximately and million at november  and  respectively 
at november  and  we had borrowings of and million  respectively  outstanding under these facilities 
we also have various term loans  bonds and mortgages with financial institutions totaling approximately and million at november  and  respectively 
the expiration dates of these facilities range from to future principal payments due under these term loans  bonds and mortgages and payments due under our operating lease arrangements after november  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years years contractual obligations principal debt payments interest on debt non cancelable operating leases total we are in compliance with all material covenants or other requirements set forth in our accounts receivable financing programs and credit agreements discussed above 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no

sfas no 
 which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no

generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the new standard will be effective for us in the quarter ending february  we are in the process of assessing the impact of adopting this new standard

eitf gives guidance on how to evaluate whether the operations and cash flows of a disposed component have been or will be eliminated from ongoing operations and the types of continuing involvement that constitute significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed component 
we have applied the provisions of eitf in determining our discontinued operations as of november  on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  which expresses the view of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no

in accordance with this standard a grant date of an award exists if a the award is a unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval

fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at november   we had no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities
