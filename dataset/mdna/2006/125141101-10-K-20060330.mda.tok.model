item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations overview we operate as a provider of air pollution control products and services marketed under the kirk blum  ceco filters  cecoaire  busch international  ceco abatement systems  kbd technic k b duct and hm white trade names 
our business is focused on engineering  designing  and building equipment  and installing systems that capture  clean and destroy airborne contaminants from industrial facilities as well as equipment that controls emissions from such facilities 
we have a diversified base of more than  active customers among a myriad of industries including aerospace  brick  cement  ceramics  metalworking  ethanol  printing  paper  food  foundries  metal plating  woodworking  chemicals  tobacco  glass  automotive  and pharmaceuticals 
therefore  our business is not concentrated in a single industry or customer 
we operate under a hub and spoke business model in which executive management  finance  administrative and marketing staff serves as the hub while the sales channels serve as spokes 
we use this model throughout our operations 
this has provided us with certain efficiencies over a more decentralized model 
although we discuss four principal product lines  our operating units function as internal customers and suppliers of each others products and services and as such  products and services are intermingled in one major project 
as a result  it is not reasonably possible to segregate revenues to external customers  operating profits or identifiable assets by product line 
we have expanded our business by adding ceco abatement systems  cecoaire  k b duct  ceco filters  india and hm white  while divesting of the operating assets of air purator corporation in and busch martec in neither were strategically important to us 
much of our business is driven by various regulatory standards and guidelines governing air quality in and outside factories 
favorable conditions in the economy generally lead to plant expansions and construction of new industrial sites 
economic expansion provides us with the potential to increase and accelerate levels of growth 
however  as we have seen in past years  in a weak economy customers tend to lengthen the time between inquiry and order or may defer purchases 
we have made significant strides in reducing our leverage through cash generated by operations and asset sales  which has reduced our debt carrying costs 
we ended with senior debt of million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  results of operations our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and reflect our operations consolidated with the operations of our subsidiaries

orders booked in were million compared with million in the increase in bookings was due to a continuing strengthening in the economy throughout the year including several large orders booked in we continue to experience an increased level of customer inquiry and quoting activities 
this improvement in the economy could result in increased air quality related capital spending 
gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization increased by to million in compared with million in gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in compared to in the increase in the gross profit percentage of was due to increased efficiencies resulting from the increase in sales volume without a corresponding increase in operating expenses 
we also benefited from better overall margins in our product mix and backlog as jobs closed out with higher than expected profits 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for and were and respectively 
this increase was due to increases in incentive compensation related to improving financial performance and order bookings  increased legal and professional fees due to various sec filings and registrations as well as costs associated with refinancing our long term debt 
depreciation and amortization remained constant at million for both years 
this was due primarily to reduced capital expenditures during periods of lower liquidity

other expense in also includes a non cash charge of  related to the impairment of fixed assets which had been retained from the discontinued operation of us facilities management 
these charges were offset by the deferred gain recognized from the sale and leaseback of our conshohocken  pennsylvania property which is being recognized over the ensuing three year lease back period 
the other income for the year ended december  was primarily a dividend of  from factory power which was a partnership with an adjacent manufacturing company to provide power to some of the other companies in the industrial park 
the partnership no longer provides any services to the area and will be liquidated

in  the individual larger contracts decreased slightly 
orders booked in were million compared with million in the large increase in bookings was due to the strengthening in the economy in the second half of the year coupled with several large orders booked in  including work for a steel production facility  an ethanol processing facility and an aluminum recycling facility 
we have experienced an increased level of customer inquiry and quoting activities in the later half of relative to the first half of this may be partially attributable to a perceived improvement in the economy by our customers  which could result in increased air quality related capital spending 
this favorable trend could lead to an increase in our future sales 
gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization was million in compared with million in gross profit  as a percentage of sales  was in compared to in the slight decrease was due to our product mix and lower margins realized in our contracting operations coupled with increasing material costs 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million to million in selling and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues for and were 
the cost reduction initiatives we implemented in and have helped to stabilize these costs at the current volume level 
depreciation and amortization remained constant at million for both years 
this was due primarily to reduced capital expenditures during periods of lower liquidity 
operating income was million in and million in the decrease in operating income resulting from the higher cost of materials was offset by lower factory overhead spending  which helped to mitigate the reduction in operating income

net loss was  in and  in liquidity and capital resources at december  and december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  and  respectively 
generally  we do not carry significant cash and cash equivalent balances because excess amounts are used to pay down our revolving line of credit 
total bank and related debt as of december  was million as compared to million at december   a decrease of million due to net payments under the bank credit facilities 
the cash that we used to pay down our debt came from cash generated by operating activities 
unused credit availability under our revolving line of credit at december  was million 
the previous bank facility was replaced with a new credit facility on december  the new credit agreement was entered into by ceco environmental corp  the ceco group of companies and fifth third bank  an ohio banking corporation 
the new facility consists of a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving loan of up to million and was used to refinance existing indebtedness of the company and for general corporate purposes 
terms of the agreement  which runs through january   included a three hundred basis point reduction in interest rates to two percent over prime for the revolver and two and one quarter percent over prime for the term loan 
the agreement also provides for a sixty month amortization of the term debt and less restrictive loan covenants regarding the funded debt and fixed charge ratios 
on september   million of subordinated debt was raised from a related party with a maturity of april  and an interest rate of per annum 
in connection with the new december  credit facility  the maturity was extended to april  this debt is subordinated to the bank credit facility and the subordinated debt originally issued in december on december   the principal balance of the notes owed to green diamond was increased for the unpaid accrued interest 
the principal balance for the million subordinated note was increased by the accrued interest of million to million and the principal balance for the million subordinated note was increased by  to million 
the entire principal balance of this obligation will be due upon maturity 
proceeds were used to reduce the revolving line of credit 
overview of cash flows and liquidity for the year ended december  s in thousands total operating cash flow purchases of property and equipment proceeds from sale of property net cash provided by used in investing activities proceeds from issuance of common stock and detachable warrants repayments of borrowings  net proceeds from subordinated notes net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease 
table of contents million was generated from operating activities in the increase in cash provided was due primarily to improved operating performance which is reflected in our net loss 
operating income was reduced by a non cash charge of  for the fair market value adjustment of detachable stock warrants  non cash interest expense of  and non cash income tax expense of  we created additional cash from a decrease in accounts receivable of  resulting from improved collections 
cash was also provided by an increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings of  the working capital accounts that used cash were an inventory increase of  an increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts of  and a decrease accounts payable and accrued expenses of  our net investment in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and current portion of debt at december  was million as compared to million at december  looking forward  we will continue to manage our net investment in working capital 
we believe that our working capital needs will tend to change at a lower rate than the change in sales due to the acceleration of progress billings and collections of such on major contracts 
in  million was generated from operating activities 
cash provided was impacted by our net loss adjusted for non cash items and increasing working capital demands from increasing sales 
we used additional cash due to an increase in accounts receivable of million that was due to increasing sales in the fourth quarter 
the other working capital accounts that used cash were inventory and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from increased purchases on increasing sales volume provided cash of million 
cash was also provided by increases in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and an increase in other liabilities 
our net investment in working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and current portion of debt at december  was million as compared to million at december  net cash used in investing activities related to the acquisition of capital expenditures for property and equipment was  for compared with  for the same period in we are managing our capital expenditures in light of the current level of sales 
should sales increase in  we anticipate increased capital expenditure spending 
additional capital expenditures may be incurred related to the replacement facilities subject to the successful completion of the sale of our cincinnati property 
financing activities used cash of million during compared with cash used of million during the same period of current year financing activities included net borrowings of  on our revolving line of credit and payments of million on our term loan 
our backlog has increased from million in to million in  and the company believes that the amount available on its credit facility  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet its short term needs for liquidity over the next twelve months 
additionally  in the longer term  we have real estate with market values significantly in excess of debt which may be sold to generate cash flow 
our cost reduction initiatives in prior years will have both short term and long term cash flow implications 
a lower or more stable cost structure will be beneficial in future periods as revenues increase and costs do not increase proportionately 
we also have access to additional financing by increasing the amount of our subordinated debt obtained through related parties 
dividends we did not pay any dividends during the years ended december  and and do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future as we are party to various loan documents that prevent us from paying such dividends 
debt covenants the company entered into the new bank facility on december  the new bank facility was entered into by ceco environmental corp  the ceco group of companies and fifth third bank  an ohio 
table of contents banking corporation 
the new bank facility consists of a term loan in the amount of million and a revolving loan of up to million 
the proceeds were used to refinance existing indebtedness of the company and will be used for general corporate purposes 
terms of new bank facility  which terminates january   includes a three hundred basis point reduction in interest rates from the prior bank facility  and longer amortization of the term debt and less restrictive loan covenants than the prior bank facility 
the new financial covenants require compliance including at december  and each quarter through december  maximum leverage to adjusted ebitda of to and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to in the future  if we cannot comply with the terms of the new bank facility agreements it will be necessary for us obtain a waiver or renegotiate our loan covenants  and there can be no assurance that such negotiations would be successful 
in the event that we are not successful in obtaining a waiver or an amendment  we would be declared in default  which would cause all amounts owed to be immediately due and payable 
employee benefit obligations based on the assumptions used to value other postretirement obligations  life insurance benefits and retiree healthcare benefits  in the fourth quarter of  cash payments for these benefits are expected to be in the range of  in each of the next years 
based on current assumptions  estimated contributions of  may be required in for the pension plan and  for the retiree healthcare plan 
the amount and timing of required contributions to the pension trust depends on future investment performance of the pension funds and interest rate movements  among other things and  accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate actual required payments 
currently  our pension plan is under funded 
as a result  absent major increases in long term interest rates  above average returns on pension assets and or changes in legislated funding requirements  we will be required to make contributions to our pension trust of varying amounts in the long term 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table lists our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands of dollars 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a estimated interest payments estimated pension funding subordinated debt b estimated interest payments on subordinated debt operating lease obligations c purchase obligations d a as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
c primarily as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
d primarily consists of purchase obligations for various costs associated with uncompleted sales contracts 
estimated interest payments associated with long term debt are based on anticipated interest payments on the term debt and estimated interest payments on the line of credit are based on the projected borrowing levels throughout the term of the line of credit 
interest payments associated with the repayment of the subordinated debt are based on the fixed rates  outstanding principal and anticipated payment dates 
interest on the subordinated debt was not previously permitted under the credit facility and therefore  prior accrued interest is assumed to be paid upon maturity of the 
table of contents debt for purposes of this schedule 
at december   accrued interest of million on related party subordinated debt was capitalized as principal and the related notes were amended to reflect this increase 
pension funding was assumed to stay at current levels based on consistent discount and long term return rates  current funding levels and no significant changes in plan design or benefits 
cash flow requirements will be met by utilizing cash provided from operating activities  supplemented by additional borrowing on the company s line of credit facility to finance any short term cash deficiency 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity 
revenue recognition a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from contracts  which are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date compared to estimated total contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
this method requires a higher degree of management judgment and use of estimates than other revenue recognition methods 
the judgments and estimates involved include management s ability to accurately estimate the contracts percentage of completion and the reasonableness of the estimated costs to complete  among other factors  at each financial reporting period 
in addition  certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project  over which we have no or limited control  and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 
delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors  changes in the scope of the project  weather  and labor availability also can have an effect on a contract s profitability 
contract costs include direct material  labor costs  and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  and other overhead expenses 
selling and administrative expenses are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes to job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to contract revenue and costs and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are made 
we provided for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts of   and at december   and  respectively 
inventory costing all inventories are currently valued at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out fifo method 
prior to december   inventories were valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo inventory method for the labor content of work in process and finished products and substantially all inventories of steel at our cincinnati facility approximately of total inventories at december  
the remaining contents in our inventory were valued using the fifo method 
management changed its method of accounting for its lifo inventory to the fifo method as management believes the fifo method is preferable because it provides a better matching of costs to revenues  provides a more meaningful presentation of the company s financial position by reflecting recent costs in the balance sheet  and provides for a uniform costing method across the company s operations 
the lifo method of inventory valuation for all classes of inventory approximated the fifo value at december  and and therefore  prior periods 
table of contents have not been restated for this accounting change 
the effect of the change for the three months ended december  and the year ended december  was an increase to inventory of  the effect on net loss for the three months ended december  and the year ended december  was a reduction of  net loss per share was reduced for the three months ended december  and the year ended december  by impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill we review the carrying value of our long lived assets held for use and assets to be disposed of periodically when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of such assets 
for all assets excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
if this occurs  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this accounting standard  we no longer amortize our goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life and are required to complete an annual impairment test 
we have determined that we have a single reporting unit  as defined in sfas no 
 within our company 
we completed our impairment test during as required by this accounting standard and have not recognized an impairment charge related to the adoption of this accounting standard 
the impairment test requires us to forecast our future cash flows  which requires significant judgment 
as of december   we have million of goodwill  
million of intangible assets finite life  million of indefinite life intangible assets  and million of property  plant  and equipment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes and tax valuation allowances we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and will provide necessary valuation allowances as required 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if we continue to operate at a loss or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to record a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities at december  totaled million and million  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefit plan assumptions we sponsor a pension plan for certain union employees 
we also sponsor a postretirement healthcare benefit plan for certain office employees retiring before january  several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include key assumptions  such as a discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension or postretirement healthcare benefit expenses we have recorded or may record in the future 
an analysis for the expense associated with our pension plan is difficult due to the variety of assumptions utilized 
for example  one of the significant assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation is the discount rate 
at december   a basis point change in the discount 
table of contents rate would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately  and the annual post retirement expense by less than  additionally  a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would change the annual post retirement expense by approximately  other significant accounting policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by us when there are acceptable alternatives 
backlog our backlog consists of orders we have received for products and services we expect to ship and deliver within the next months 
our backlog  as of december  was million compared to million as of december  there can be no assurances that backlog will be replicated  increased or translated into higher revenues in the future 
the success of our business depends on a multitude of factors related to our backlog and the orders secured during the subsequent period s 
certain contracts are highly dependent on the work of contractors and other subcontractors participating in a project  over which we have no or limited control  and their performance on such project could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts 
delays resulting from these contractors and subcontractors  changes in the scope of the project  weather  and labor availability also can have an effect on a contract s profitability 
reclassifications certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation

this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas revised share based payments fas r 
fas r replaces fas accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb accounting for stock issued to employees 
as revised by the securities and exchange commission  we will be required to adopt fas r beginning january  fas r requires all share based awards to employees  and any subsequent modifications to those awards  to be recognized in the financial statements based on a fair value based method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under fas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
fas r permits companies to adopt the new standard using either a modified prospective transition 
table of contents method or a modified retrospective transition method 
using the modified prospective transition method  compensation expense would be recorded for all unvested awards at the beginning of the first quarter of fas r adoption based upon the values assigned to grants and modifications of stock compensation used in the proforma disclosures made in accordance with the original provisions of fas under the modified retrospective method  companies are permitted to restate financial statements of previous periods using those proforma amounts 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard 
we expect that the effect on net income and earnings per share in the periods following adoption will be consistent with amounts reported in our pro forma disclosures under fas see note 
however  the actual effect on net income and earnings per share will vary depending on the terms and number of options ultimately granted

raw materials the profitability of our manufactured products is affected by changing purchase prices of steel and other materials 
if higher steel or other material prices cannot be passed onto to our customers  operating income will be adversely affected 
credit risk as part of our ongoing control procedures  we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with financial institutions with which we conduct business
