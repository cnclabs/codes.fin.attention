item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to help the reader gain a better understanding of our financial condition and our results of operations 
it is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and accompanying notes 
executive summary the following charts summarize certain key line items of our results of operations by business segment for the three year period ended march  dollars in millions revenues bar chart earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle bar chart other consists of the financial results of our investment real estate and home services operations  as well as corporate general and administrative expense  interest expense and intersegment eliminations 
fiscal year represents our tenth consecutive year of growth in revenues and earnings from continuing operations 
revenues for the year ended march  increased to billion as compared to the year ended march  in addition  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the year ended march  increased to billion as compared to the prior year 
the primary drivers of the growth in our home building business are growth in closings  increases in average unit selling prices and leverage of selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended march   we experienced improvements in these key areas 
home building s operating margin operating earnings as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended march  
table of contents in the long term  the overall demand for housing in the united states is driven by population growth  immigration  household formations and increasing home ownership rates 
short term growth drivers such as mortgage rates  consumer confidence and employment levels can also impact housing demand 
the highly fragmented homebuilding industry is in the early stages of a consolidation phase during which large homebuilders grow faster than the industry as a whole 
in  based upon single family permits issued in the united states  the largest homebuilders represented approximately of the housing market 
in calendar year the most recent data available  the largest homebuilders were producing approximately of the nation s new housing stock 
we believe industry consolidation will continue to be an important growth factor over the next decade or more as large homebuilders realize the benefits of size  such as capital strength  more efficient operations and technological advantages 
in the past few months  we and other homebuilders have reported declines or slower growth rates in the volume of homes sold  and there have been reports of increased inventory of new and used homes 
we attribute the changes in the market to increases in housing inventories as a result of speculative investors becoming net sellers of homes rather than net buyers  a change in consumer confidence and urgency to buy homes  and interest rates that have trended higher throughout the year 
consistent with this trend  during the second half of fiscal year  we have experienced an increase in customer cancellations  which has resulted in either declines or less rapid growth in sales orders net of cancellations of our homes in a number of markets 
we believe the homebuilding industry is transitioning to a more sustainable level 
however  a significant deterioration of these and other homebuilding economic factors could result in continued and prolonged decreases in demand for new homes 
as of march   we had homebuilding operations in of the largest housing markets in the united states 
we have largely completed our geographic diversification plan and are now focused primarily on further penetration in our existing markets 
financial services operating results in fiscal year have been negatively impacted by increases in funding costs and selling  general and administrative expenses offset by increases in interest income and revenues from loan sales to investors 
refinancing activity has remained relatively flat due to an extended period of relatively low mortgage loan rates  which reduced the supply of loans likely to be refinanced 
recent increases in mortgage loan rates have helped to continue this trend 
interest rates may continue to increase in future periods 
ctx mortgage company  llc will continue to focus on serving the customers of our home building segment and increasing the percentage of prime mortgage loans provided to them 
our prime mortgage lending business is a fee based business with low capital requirements 
the results of operations of certain of our segments  including our home building and financial services operations  may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
any significant increase in mortgage interest rates above current prevailing levels could affect demand for housing  at least in the short term  and could reduce the ability or willingness of prospective home buyers to finance home purchases and or it could curtail mortgage refinance activity 
although we expect that we would make adjustments in our operations in an effort to mitigate the effects of any increase in interest rates  there can be no assurances that these efforts would be successful 
recent increases in interest rates have had an adverse effect on the operating earnings of our financial services operations 
our construction services segment operating earnings increased from the prior year as a result of an increase in active multi unit residential projects  which have higher profit margins 
at march   construction services backlog was billion  an increase of over the prior year 
strategically  we will continue to focus on our core geographic and selected industry segments which provide greater opportunity to achieve growth in construction services revenues and operating earnings 
on march   we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to sell our sub prime home equity lending operations to an unrelated third party 
as a result  home equity is now reflected as a discontinued operation in our financial statements 
however  the sale of home equity is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals from state financial services or other regulatory authorities 
the purchase price to be received in connection with the sale of home equity will consist of payments based on the book value of home equity  plus a premium to be calculated in accordance with an agreed upon formula 
entering into a definitive agreement to sell home equity is consistent with our strategic plan to focus on our domestic home building operations and related ancillary businesses 
in fiscal year  we repurchased an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a total purchase price of million  including commissions paid 
we expect to continue to repurchase shares of common stock as and when market conditions are favorable for share repurchases 
as of march   our remaining share repurchase authorization totaled million shares 
on may   we announced that our board of directors 
table of contents authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares and that subsequent to march   we completed our previous share authorization by purchasing million shares in open market transactions 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year home building the following summarizes the results of our home building operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions except per unit data and lot information for the years ended march  change change revenues housing revenues land sales and other cost of sales housing cost of sales land sales and other selling  general and administrative expenses earnings from unconsolidated entities operating earnings operating earnings as a percentage of revenues housing operations total homebuilding operations for the years ended march  change change units closed mid atlantic southeast midwest southwest west coast average sales price per unit mid atlantic southeast midwest southwest west coast total home building revenues increased in fiscal year due to increases in closings and average sales prices  along with a greater mix of homes closed in markets with higher average sales prices 
all regions experienced double digit increases in both closings and average sales prices except for the midwest  which has seen only moderate increases as a result of general economic conditions in that region 

table of contents the increase in unit closings is reflective of an increase in average operating neighborhoods and an increase in closings per average neighborhood as outlined in the table below 
for the years ended march  change change average operating neighborhoods closings per average neighborhood we define a neighborhood as an individual active selling location targeted to a specific buyer segment with greater than ten homes remaining to be sold 
the increase in average operating neighborhoods for the year ended march   is the result of opening new neighborhoods and closing out of neighborhoods 
operating margins consisting of operating earnings as a percentage of revenues improved to for the year ended march  as compared to for the year ended march  the increase in operating margins is reflective of an improvement in housing gross margins and a slight improvement in selling  general and administrative leverage  offset to a lesser extent by a decrease in earnings from land sales and other 
increases in average unit selling price and continued focus on controlling direct construction costs contributed to the housing gross margin improvement 
national and regional purchasing programs and local cost reduction and efficiency efforts have helped partially offset increasing raw material costs experienced throughout the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses include all homebuilding employee compensation and related benefits  selling commissions and marketing and advertising costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended march  primarily due to increases in employee count to support neighborhood growth and increased incentive compensation reflective of the growth in operating earnings 
operating earnings from land sales and other decreased to million primarily due to lower margins on current year land sales as compared to the prior year 
we frequently write off deposits and pre acquisition costs as a component of our ongoing land acquisition process and evaluation of potential market opportunities 
in fiscal year  we recognized an increase in losses due to the write off of certain option deposits and pre acquisition costs  which increase is reflective of the softening of certain markets 
our cost of land sales and other also includes the write off of development costs for neighborhoods where all or substantially all homes had already been closed 
the timing and amount of land sales vary from period to period based on several factors  including the location  size  availability and desirability of the land we own in each market 
we deploy disciplined capital allocation and management strategies and processes in each of our markets 
we also have individual market focused land acquisition and entitlement resources 
the execution of our capital management strategies  combined with the value created by our land acquisition and entitlement teams  result in sales of parcels of land from time to time 
in some cases  the purpose of these sales may be to take advantage of an opportunity to realize value that has been created through the entitlement process for parcels on which we are not likely to be able to build homes for some time 
these sales may also fund the acquisition of more desirable tracts in a market 
additionally  in certain situations  we may acquire more land than is required to support our planned growth in a particular geographic area 
in addition  our resort and second home operations sell land in the normal course of conducting their operations 

table of contents the following tables summarize sales orders and backlog units for the years ended march  change change sales orders in units mid atlantic southeast midwest southwest west coast sales per average neighborhood as of march  change change backlog units mid atlantic southeast midwest southwest west coast we believe that core demand for our housing products remains strong despite a current transition to more sustainable conditions in those markets that have experienced above trend pricing growth 
sales orders for fiscal year were up as compared to the prior year 
both the southwest and west coast regions experienced double digit increases in sales orders in fiscal year  while the southeast region was down 
sales per average neighborhood dropped slightly from prior year due to moderating growth experienced in certain markets 
most of the decline in sales per average neighborhood has been experienced over the last six months  and higher discounts and other sales incentives have increased to sustain sales volumes 
increases in customer cancellations have resulted in either declines or less rapid growth in sales orders net of cancellations of our homes in a number of markets 
cancellation rates have increased from in the prior year to in fiscal year the following table summarizes our land position as of march  and as of march  lots lots lots lots owned controlled total lots owned controlled total lots mid atlantic southeast midwest southwest west coast change our total land position increased in fiscal year as compared to a increase in the prior year 
the decrease in our land position growth rate in fiscal year is reflective of current housing market conditions and the transitioning of certain markets to normalized conditions 
our total land position owned or controlled under option agreements at march  will provide land for approximately of closings for fiscal year  of closings for fiscal year  and of closings for fiscal year based on our current closing projections 

table of contents included in our total land position are approximately  lots controlled through joint venture arrangements 
we have completed our due diligence on  lots that we control including certain of such lots controlled through joint ventures 
financial services the financial services segment is primarily engaged in the residential mortgage lending business  as well as other financial services that are in large part related to the residential mortgage market 
its operations include mortgage lending and other related services for purchasers of homes sold by our home building operations and other homebuilders  title agency services and the sale of title insurance and other insurance products  including property and casualty

interest revenues on residential mortgage loans receivable are recognized using the interest actuarial method 
other revenues  including fees for title insurance and other services performed in connection with mortgage lending activities  are recognized as earned 
in the normal course of its activities  ctx mortgage company  llc and its related companies carry inventories of loans pending sale to third party investors and earn an interest margin  which we define as the difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans held for sale and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans 
our business strategy of selling prime loans reduces our capital investment and related risks  provides substantial liquidity and is an efficient process given the size and liquidity of the prime mortgage loan secondary capital markets 
ctx mortgage company  llc originates mortgage loans and sells them to hsf i and investors 
hsf i is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary and is consolidated with our financial services segment 
hsf i s debt and subordinated certificates do not have recourse to us 
we do not guarantee the payment of any debt or subordinated certificates of hsf i or are not liable for credit losses relating to securitized residential mortgage loans sold to hsf i 
revenues for the year ended march  increased over the prior year due to increases in interest income  loan sales to investors  and title and insurance fees 
loan funding costs also increased as a result of higher short term interest rates 
this increase in funding costs was the primary factor contributing to the decrease in interest margin for the year ended march  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended march  is related to additions to our branch network and sales management infrastructure 
the increase in interest expense resulted in our decrease in operating margin for the year ended march

revenues for the year ended march  decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher concentration of projects with extended construction periods 
the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  is primarily the result of improved job profit margins 
in fiscal year  there has been an increase in active multi unit residential projects  which have higher profit margins while at the same time lower margin jobs have completed and dropped out of the mix of business 
as of march   we had active projects which represent a increase over the prior year 
the increase in new contracts executed for the year ended march  and in backlog of uncompleted contracts was primarily due to the execution of contracts for multi unit residential projects for which the construction periods range from three to five years 
construction services defines backlog as the uncompleted portion of all signed contracts 
construction services multi unit residential backlog of billion includes million of vertical construction projects for our home building business segment 
construction services has also been awarded work that is pending execution of a signed contract 
at march  and  such work  which is not included in backlog  was approximately billion and billion  respectively 
there is no assurance that this awarded work will result in future revenues

we had  pest defense customers as of march  as compared to  in the prior year 
the decrease in our home services division s operating loss for the year ended 
table of contents march  is primarily due to the prior year s results including a million write down of notes receivable 
in addition  marketing expenses increased in fiscal year as a result of expansion and growth of our home services operations  which increased home services operating loss 
the decrease in our investment real estate operations operating earnings is primarily related to a reduction in sales of real estate and commercial property over the past two years 
we have liquidated substantially all of this portfolio and are not investing additional capital in investment real estate operations 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent corporate employee compensation and other corporate costs such as investor communications  insurance  rent and professional services 
the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses in fiscal year is primarily related to professional fees associated with various strategic initiatives  increases in performance based compensation related costs as a result of increases in our earnings and returns and increases in insurance related costs 
for further information on interest expense  see note a  significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total interest incurred was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in total interest incurred is primarily related to an increase in average debt outstanding as compared to the prior year 
our effective tax rate remained relatively unchanged at for the years ended march  and  which is less than the combined federal statutory and state rate of due to benefits associated with the new federal deduction for qualified domestic production activities and a million payment in september from the us treasury  offset by a reduction in net operating loss carryforward benefits 
the million payment is effectively a tax refund and represents a payment received on a judgment against the us government for revoking tax benefits we had previously claimed in connection with our acquisition and operation of a savings and loan association in the late s and early s 
discontinued operations in september  we sold our international homebuilding operations  which had previously been included in the home building segment 
as a result of the sale  international homebuilding s operations have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of consolidated earnings  and any assets and liabilities related to these discontinued operations have been presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets 
all prior period information has been reclassified to be consistent with the march  presentation 
on march  we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to sell our sub prime home equity lending operations to an unrelated third party 
as a result  home equity is now reflected as a discontinued operation in our financial statements 
however  the sale of home equity is subject to certain conditions  including regulatory approvals from state financial services or other regulatory authorities 
the purchase price to be received in connection with the sale of home equity will consist of payments based on the book value of home equity  plus a premium to be calculated in accordance with an agreed upon formula

our portfolio growth translated into more interest income  our largest component of revenue 
home equity recorded million and million in net revenue and operating earnings related to the whole loan sales for the years ended march  and  respectively 
whole loan sales have the effect of increasing current revenues but decreasing future interest margin that would have been recognized had the loans been securitized or retained as inventory 
home equity s strategy is to originate loans for investment with the intent to securitize 
however  a program of whole loan sales is a component of home equity s diversification of funding sources 
whole loan sales vary from period to period based upon market conditions and home equity s funding requirements 
cost of sales is comprised of interest expense  which increased in fiscal year as a result of increases in our average debt outstanding and increases in interest rates as compared to the prior year 
operating expenses for the year ended march  increased primarily as a result of home equity s continued growth 
the increase in loan production volume  the expansion of branch offices and the increase in the average number of employees led to a corresponding increase in salaries and related costs  rent expense and group insurance costs 
the loan loss varies from year to year based upon several factors 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policy and methodology for establishing the provision for losses  see critical accounting estimates discontinued operations  valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment 
in the second quarter of fiscal year and in october  hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma impacted certain of our operations 
these hurricanes damaged certain collateral underlying home equity s mortgage loans held for investment 
losses associated with the impact of the hurricanes were not material to our results of operations or financial condition 
the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  is primarily attributable to the growth in our portfolio which translated into an increase in interest income  as well as an increase in whole loan sale net revenues 
in the current year  interest margin decreased primarily as a result of higher borrowing costs  as well as increased competitive industry conditions 
average interest earning assets and liabilities for the year ended march  increased primarily as a result of continued growth in our portfolio of residential mortgage loans held for investment

the following summarizes the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced by home equity as of march  and for the years ended march  change change servicing portfolio number of loans portfolio accounting method serviced for others total dollars in billions portfolio accounting method serviced for others total home equity periodically securitizes mortgage loans in order to provide long term funding for its mortgage operations and to reduce its interest rate exposure on fixed rate loans 
the majority of home equity s servicing portfolio is accounted for using the portfolio accounting method in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  where loan originations are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest income is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest actuarial method  the mortgage loans receivable and the securitization debt asset backed certificates remain on home equity s balance sheet  and the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement 
this structure of securitizations has been utilized since april  another component of home equity s servicing portfolio includes loans sold on a whole loan basis that home equity continues to service and securitizations accounted for as gains on sale in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  where from october through march  an estimate of the entire gain resulting from the sale was included in earnings during the period in which the securitization transaction occurred 
these loans are included in the serviced for others category in the above table 
unlike the portfolio accounting method  our balance sheet does not reflect the mortgage loans receivable or the offsetting debt resulting from these securitizations 
however  under the gain on sale method  home equity s retained residual interest in  as well as the servicing rights to  the securitized loans are reflected on the balance sheet 
home equity carries mortgage securitization residual interest  or msri  at fair value on the balance sheet 
the structure of securitizations has no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of the mortgages 
however  the structure does affect the timing of profit recognition 
under both structures  recourse on the securitized debt is limited to the payments received on the underlying mortgage collateral with no 
table of contents recourse to home equity or centex corporation 
as is common in these structures  home equity remains liable for customary loan representations 
the primary risks in home equity s operations are consistent with those of the financial services industry and include credit risk associated with its loans  liquidity risk related to funding its loans and interest rate risk prior to securitization of the loans 
in addition  it is also subject to prepayment risks principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions associated with loans securitized prior to april fiscal year compared to fiscal year home building the following summarizes the results of our home building operations for the two year period ended march  dollars in millions except per unit data and lot information for the years ended march  change change revenues housing revenues land sales and other cost of sales housing cost of sales land sales and other selling  general and administrative expenses earnings from unconsolidated entities operating earnings operating earnings as a percentage of revenues for the years ended march  change change units closed average unit sales price operating earnings per unit average operating neighborhoods closings per average neighborhood as of march  change change backlog units lots owned lots controlled total lots owned and controlled the following summarizes changes in performance indicators for the year ended march  as compared to fiscal year for the year ended march   we opened neighborhoods and closed out of neighborhoods  driving our average operating neighborhoods to  a increase over fiscal year higher sales rates contributed to our growth in closings per average neighborhood

for the year ended march   average selling prices were up to  as compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to strong demand in the southeast and west coast regions resulting in pricing power  as well as a greater mix of homes closed in the west coast region 
california experienced the largest average sales price increase among the states in which we operate as average prices rose to  a  increase over fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased at a slightly higher rate than revenues for the year ended march  primarily due to increases in employee count to support planned neighborhood growth and increased incentive compensation reflective of the growth in operating earnings

home equity recorded approximately million in net revenue and operating earnings related to the whole loan sales for the year ended march  cost of sales increased in fiscal year commensurate with increases in our average debt outstanding and increases in interest rates since fiscal year operating expenses for the year ended march  increased as a result of home equity s continued growth 
the increase in loan production volume  the expansion of branch offices and the increase in the number of employees led to a corresponding increase in salaries and related costs  rent expense  group insurance costs and advertising expenditures 
the increase in the loan loss provision for the year ended march  occurred primarily because of the increase in residential mortgage loans held for investment 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policy and methodology for establishing the provision for losses  see critical accounting estimates valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment 
changes in the allowance for losses are included in note p  discontinued operations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  was primarily attributable to the increase in interest margin  which we define as the difference between interest revenue on mortgage loans held for sale or investment and interest expense on debt used to fund the mortgage loans 
interest margin for the year ended march  increased primarily as a result of an increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment 
in fiscal year  interest margin as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily as a result of an increasing interest rate environment  as well as increased competitive industry conditions 
whole loan sale transactions also contributed to the increase in operating earnings for the year ended march  average interest earning assets and liabilities for the year ended march  increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of loan originations and an increase in average loan size see table below 
the following table provides a comparative analysis of mortgage loan originations and applications for the two year period ended march  for the years ended march  change change origination volume in millions number of loans originated number of loan applications average loan size the increase in origination volume was due to an increase in the average loan size and an increase in the overall sales force  which resulted in an increase in the number of loan applications received

we believe that separate disclosure of the consolidating information is useful because the financial services subsidiaries and related companies operate in a distinctly different financial environment that generally requires significantly less equity to support their higher debt levels compared to the operations of our other subsidiaries  the financial services subsidiaries and related companies have structured their financing programs substantially on a stand alone basis  and centex has limited obligations with respect to the indebtedness of our financial services subsidiaries and related companies 
management uses this information in its financial and strategic planning 
we also use this presentation to allow investors to compare us to homebuilders that do not have financial services operations 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  the statements of consolidating cash flows have not been restated for discontinued operations 
as a result  all international homebuilding cash flows are included with the centex cash flows and all home equity cash flows are included with the financial services cash flows 

table of contents we generally fund our centex operating and other short term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations  borrowings from commercial paper and other short term credit arrangements  and the issuance of senior debt 
centex s operating cash is derived primarily through home and land sales from our home building segment and general contracting fees obtained through our construction services segment 
during fiscal year  cash was primarily used in centex s operating activities to finance increases in home building inventories relating to the increased level of sales and resulting units under construction during the year  and for the acquisition of land held for development 
the funds provided by centex s financing activities were primarily from debt issued to fund the increased homebuilding activity and share repurchases 
we generally fund our financial services operating and other short term liquidity needs through home equity s securitizations  committed credit facilities  proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans to hsf i and investors and cash flows from operations 
financial services operating cash is derived primarily through sales of mortgage loans  interest income on mortgage loans held by home equity for investment and origination and servicing fees 
effective july   financial services consolidated billion of hsf i s residential mortgage loans held for sale 
the initial consolidation of hsf i was not reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows  as it was a non cash transaction 
as these mortgage loans were sold in the secondary market in fiscal year  an inflow of cash from operating activities occurred 
for additional discussion on the consolidation of hsf i in june  see note d  indebtedness  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial services cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year was primarily from a reduction in home equity s residential mortgage loans held for investment 
home equity originates residential mortgage loans with the intent to securitize  however  whole loan sales do occur periodically 
during fiscal years and  cash was primarily used in financial services investing activities to finance increases in home equity s residential mortgage loans held for investment 
financial services cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was primarily from the repayment of debt from the liquidation of home equity s residential mortgage loans held for investment 
the funds provided by financial services financing activities in fiscal years and were primarily from new debt used to fund the increased residential mortgage loan activity

the basis of the rate is us month libor which was at march  as outlined above  our primary contractual obligations are principal and interest payments under long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases 
the long term debt obligations include principal and interest payments for variable interest entities consolidated pursuant to the provisions of fin variable interest entities debt does not have recourse to us  and the consolidation of this debt has not changed our debt ratings 
we do not guarantee the payment of any variable interest entities debt 
purchase obligations primarily represent joint funding obligations  open purchase orders and specific performance agreements of our home building segment that in essence may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations 

table of contents our contractual obligations will be funded in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows and through our credit facilities 
centex corporation currently has an investment grade credit rating from each of the principal credit rating agencies 
our ability to finance our activities on favorable terms is dependent to a significant extent on whether we are able to maintain our investment grade credit ratings 
we attempt to manage our debt levels in order to maintain investment grade ratings 
if  however  our debt ratings were downgraded  we would not have access to the commercial paper markets and might need to draw on our existing committed backup facility

ctx mortgage company  llc also maintains million of secured  committed mortgage warehouse facilities to finance mortgages 
under this facility  home equity is permitted to securitize its mortgage servicer advances in an amount up to million with a final maturity of may this facility has no recourse to centex corporation 
as part of the planned sale of home equity  on the closing date of the sale  the purchaser will purchase all of the mortgage loans held by harwood street funding ii  llc  which we refer to as hsf ii 
the change in control of home equity will terminate hsf ii s commitment to purchase new loans from home equity and permit the orderly liquidation of hsf ii 
the amount of available capacity for continuing operations consists of  million of committed capacity and million of uncommitted capacity as of march  although we believe that the uncommitted capacity is currently available  there can be no assurance that the lenders under these facilities would elect to make advances if and when requested to do so 
mortgage loans held for sale are primarily funded by ctx mortgage company  llc s sale of mortgage loans to hsf i 
hsf i acquires mortgage loans from ctx mortgage company  llc  holds them on average approximately days and then resells them into the secondary market 
hsf i obtains the funds needed to purchase eligible mortgage loans from ctx mortgage company  llc by issuing short term secured liquidity notes

on may   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million shares and that subsequent to march   we completed our previous share authorization by purchasing million shares in open market transactions 
this increased share repurchase authorization will allow us to continue to execute a balanced strategy of investing in our homebuilding business to position us for future growth and return capital to our stockholders through share repurchases 
certain off balance sheet obligations the following is a summary of certain off balance sheet arrangements and other obligations and their possible effects on our liquidity and capital resources 
joint ventures we conduct a portion of our land acquisition  development and other activities through our participation in joint ventures in which we hold less than a majority interest 
these land related activities typically require substantial capital  and partnering with other developers and  to a lesser extent  financial partners  allows home building to share the risks and rewards of ownership and to provide broader strategic advantages

we could be requested to contribute additional capital to these joint ventures to the extent the loan to value ratio falls below the specified ratio 
we have not been requested to perform under a limited maintenance guarantee  and we do not anticipate that any capital contributions will be made in future periods under these guarantees 
these amounts represent our maximum exposure based on the joint ventures debt at each respective date 
we have guaranteed repayment of a portion of certain joint venture debt limited to our ownership percentage of the joint venture or a percentage thereof 
debt agreements for joint ventures vary by lender in terms of structure and level of recourse 
for certain of the joint ventures we are also liable on a contingent basis  through other guarantees  letters of credit or other arrangements  with respect to a portion of the construction debt 
certain joint venture agreements require us to guarantee the completion of a project or phase if the joint venture does not perform the required development 
to the extent development costs exceed amounts available under the joint venture s credit facility  we would be liable for incremental costs to complete development 
additionally  we have agreed to indemnify the construction lender for certain environmental liabilities with respect to the project for most joint ventures  and most guarantee arrangements require that we are liable for our proportionate share of the outstanding debt if the joint venture files for voluntary bankruptcy 
we have not been requested to perform under any of these guarantees  and we do not anticipate that any capital contributions will be made in future periods related to such arrangements 
we also have investments in joint ventures related to our construction services and other segments totaling  and  as of march  and  respectively 
critical accounting estimates some of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  however  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the members of the audit committee 
impairment of long lived assets housing projects  land held for development and sale including direct construction costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes and property  plant and equipment are assessed for recoverability in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the 
table of contents assets 
no significant impairments of long lived assets were recorded in fiscal years  or see additional information on land write offs under inventory valuation discussion below 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over net assets of businesses acquired 
see note c  goodwill  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the changes in goodwill by segment 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment conducted as of january  at the reporting unit level  by applying a fair value based test 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment has occurred 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow or market valuation approach 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if the goodwill is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value 
we had no impairment of goodwill in fiscal years  or inventory valuation housing projects are stated at the lower of cost including direct construction costs  capitalized interest and real estate taxes or fair value less cost to sell 
home construction costs are accumulated on a specific identification basis 
under the specific identification basis  costs and expenses include all applicable land acquisition  land development and specific construction costs including direct and indirect costs of each home paid to third parties 
land acquisition  land development and home construction costs do not include employee related compensation and benefit costs 
the specific construction and allocated land costs of each home are included in direct construction 
direct construction also includes amounts paid through the closing date of the home for construction materials and subcontractor costs  plus an accrual for estimated costs incurred but not yet paid  based on an analysis of budgeted construction costs 
any changes to the estimated total development costs identified subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated to the remaining homes in the project 
land acquisition and land development costs are included in land under development 
land acquisition and development costs are estimated based on the total costs expected in a project 
land held for development and sale primarily consists of deposits for land purchases  related acquisition costs and land that will not begin development in the next two years 
to the extent we determine that we will not purchase a parcel of land  the deposit and related acquisition costs are charged to cost of sales 
during the year ended march   million of land was written off 
included in the cost of land sales and other were write offs of option deposits and pre acquisition costs that were classified as land held for development and sale and the write off of development costs for neighborhoods where all or substantially all homes had already been closed 
land held under option agreements not owned in order to ensure the future availability of land for homebuilding  we enter into land option purchase agreements with unaffiliated third parties 
under the option agreements  we pay a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land at a future time  usually at predetermined prices 
these options generally do not contain performance requirements from us nor obligate us to purchase the land 
land option deposits related to these options are also reclassified to land held under option agreements not owned 
to the extent we do not exercise our option to purchase such land  the amount of the lot option deposit  any letters of credit  as well as development costs incurred to date  represent our maximum exposure to loss  except in certain circumstances  which would not be material 
we have evaluated those entities with which we entered into land option agreements in accordance with the provisions of fin the provisions of fin require us to consolidate the financial results of a variable interest entity if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
variable interest entities are entities in which equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest and or the entity is unable to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the owner or investor that absorbs a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses and or receives a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns 
we determine if we are the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity 
expected gains and losses of the variable interest entity are highly dependent upon management s estimates of the variability and probabilities of future land 
table of contents prices  the probabilities of expected cash flows and entitlement risks related to the underlying land  among other factors 
based on this evaluation  if we are the primary beneficiary of those entities with which we have entered into land option agreements  the variable interest entity is consolidated 
for purposes of consolidation  to the extent financial statements or other information is available  we consolidate the assets and liabilities of the variable interest entity 
if financial statements for the variable interest entity are not available  we record the remaining purchase price of land in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption  land held under option agreements not owned  with a corresponding increase in minority interests 
see note g  land held under option agreements not owned and other land deposits  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the results of our analysis of land option agreements 
in addition to land held under option agreements recorded pursuant to the provisions of fin  to the extent our land option deposit exceeds certain thresholds  we recognize the option arrangement by recording land at the total option purchase price and related obligation in accrued liabilities 
warranty accruals home building offers a ten year limited warranty for most homes constructed and sold in the united states 
the warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship in the first two years of the home and certain designated components or structural elements of the home in the third through tenth years 
home building estimates the costs that may be incurred under its warranty program for which it will be responsible and records a liability at the time each home is closed 
factors that affect home building s warranty liability include the number of homes closed  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim 
home building periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the warranty accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
loan origination reserve ctx mortgage company  llc has established a liability for anticipated losses associated with loans originated based upon  among other factors  historical loss rates and current trends in loan originations 
this liability includes losses associated with certain borrower payment defaults  credit quality issues  or misrepresentation and reflects management s judgment of the loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
although we consider the loan origination reserve reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at march  to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with our loan originations 
this reserve may prove to be inadequate due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
insurance accruals we have certain deductible limits under our workers compensation  automobile and general liability insurance policies for which reserves are actuarially determined based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses concerning these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to factors such as claim settlement patterns  litigation trends and legal interpretations  among others 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our insurance accruals and adjust the amounts as necessary 
although we consider the insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheet to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
critical accounting estimates discontinued operations the following critical accounting estimates relate to our sub prime home equity lending operations 
as previously discussed  we entered into a definitive agreement on march  to sell home equity 
valuation of residential mortgage loans held for investment home equity originates and purchases loans in accordance with standard underwriting criteria  which are primarily intended to assess the creditworthiness of the mortgagee  the value of the mortgaged property and the adequacy of the property as collateral for the home equity loan 

table of contents home equity establishes an allowance for losses when it believes a loss has occurred 
when home equity determines that a residential mortgage loan held for investment is partially or fully uncollectible  the estimated loss is charged against the allowance for losses 
recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance at the time the recovery is collected 
we evaluate the allowance on an aggregate basis considering  among other things  the relationship of the allowance to the amount of residential mortgage loans held for investment and historical credit losses 
the allowance reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure at the end of the reporting period 
a range of expected credit losses is estimated using historical losses  static pool loss curves and delinquency modeling 
these tools take into consideration historical information regarding delinquency and loss severity experience and apply that information to the portfolio at each reporting date 
although we consider the allowance for losses on residential mortgage loans held for investment to be adequate  there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be sufficient over time to cover ultimate losses 
this allowance may prove to be insufficient due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or discrete events adversely affecting specific customers or industries 
mortgage securitization residual interest home equity uses mortgage securitizations to finance its mortgage loan portfolio 
for securitizations prior to april  which home equity accounted for as sales  home equity retained a msri 
the msri represents the present value of home equity s right to receive  over the life of the securitization  the excess of the weighted average coupon on the loans securitized over the interest rates on the securities sold  a normal servicing fee  a trustee fee and an insurance fee  where applicable  net of the credit losses relating to the loans securitized 
home equity estimates the fair value of msri through the application of discounted cash flow analysis 
such analysis requires the use of various assumptions  the most significant of which are anticipated prepayments principal reductions in excess of contractually scheduled reductions  estimated future credit losses and the discount rate applied to future cash flows 
in developing our assumptions  we consider a variety of factors  many of which are interrelated 
these factors include historical performance  origination channels  characteristics of borrowers  such as credit quality and loan to value relationships  and market factors that influence competition 
if changes in assumptions regarding anticipated prepayments  discount rates or credit losses are necessary  the msri fair value is adjusted accordingly 
as of march   our total msri was million  which consists of million remaining on loans securitized from october to march accounted for as gain on sale and million related to loans sold to a government sponsored enterprise that we continue to service 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
entitled share based payment  or sfas r 
share based payments are transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees  but expresses no preference for a type of valuation model 
sfas r supersedes apb no 
and is effective for annual periods beginning after june  we adopted sfas r effective january   and it did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued staff position  or fsp  application of fasb statement no 
 which clarified that the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of should be accounted for as a special deduction and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods during which the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
the new tax deduction for qualified production activities was effective for our fiscal year ended march  for further information  see note j  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our direct debt obligations and on mortgage loans receivable 
the following analysis provides a framework to understand our sensitivity to hypothetical changes in interest rates as of march  
table of contents centex we use both short term and long term debt in our financing strategy 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt instrument but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair market value of the debt instrument but do affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay any of our fixed rate debt prior to maturity  and as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until we refinance such debt 
as of march   short term debt was billion  of which billion was applicable to financial services 
the majority of financial services debt is collateralized by residential mortgage loans including mortgage loans held by hsf i 
we borrow on a short term basis in the commercial paper market under a million commercial paper program supported by a revolving credit facility with a term expiring in fiscal year  all of which bear interest at prevailing market rates 
the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings outstanding at march  was 
the maturities of centex s long term debt  including debt of variable interest entities consolidated pursuant to fin  outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value centex fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate we define centex as a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 
the maturities of centex s long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value centex fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate hedged debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate we define centex as a supplemental presentation that reflects the financial services segment as if accounted for under the equity method 
these variable rate notes in effect are fixed rate instruments as a result of a hedge using interest rate swaps 
financial services financial services  through ctx mortgage company  llc  enters into interest rate lock commitments  or irlcs with its customers under which ctx mortgage company  llc agrees to make mortgage loans at agreed upon rates within a period of time  generally from to days  if certain conditions are met 
initially  the irlcs are treated as derivative instruments and their fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the irlcs are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to hedge the interest rate risk related to its irlcs  ctx mortgage company  llc executes mandatory forward trade commitments  or forward trade commitments 
these forward trade commitments are not designated as hedges  and their fair value is recorded on the balance sheet in other assets or accrued liabilities 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these forward trade commitments are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
financial services originates and sells conforming and nonconforming a mortgages 
ctx mortgage company  llc sells substantially all the mortgage loans it originates to hsf i at or near the date on which the loans were funded 
ctx mortgage company  llc also executes forward trade commitments to hedge the interest rate risk related to its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale  including mortgage loans held by hsf i 
these forward trade commitments have been designated as fair value hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the forward trade 
table of contents commitments and the mortgage loans  for which the hedge relationship is deemed effective  are recorded as an adjustment to earnings 
to the extent the hedge is effective  gains or losses in the value of the hedged loans due to interest rate movement will be offset by an equal and opposite gain or loss in the value of the forward trade commitment 
this will result in no impact to earnings 
to the extent the hedge contains some ineffectiveness  the ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings 
due to the high degree of liquidity in the a mortgage market and the frequency of loan sales  the use of forward sales is an effective economic hedge against changes in market value of both irlcs and mortgage loans held for sale that result from changes in interest rates 
the estimated maturities of financial services long term debt outstanding at march  were as follows maturities through march  thereafter total fair value financial services variable rate debt average interest rate we define financial services as a supplemental presentation that reflects centex financial services  its subsidiaries and related companies

discontinued operations home equity uses interest rate swaps to hedge the market risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate securitization debt used to finance sub prime mortgages 
home equity will generally hold mortgages in anticipation of securitization for up to days 
home equity also uses interest rate swaps that in effect converted billion of its variable rate debt outstanding into fixed rate debt
