item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation unless specifically noted  the following discussion and analysis provides information on awr s consolidated operations and assets 
for the years ended december   and  there is generally no material difference between the consolidated operations and assets of awr and the operations and assets of gswc 
however  where necessary  the following discussion and analysis includes references specifically to awr s other subsidiaries ccwc and asus 
overview our revenues  income  and cash flows are earned primarily through delivering drinking water to homes and businesses 
rates charged to customers of gswc and ccwc are determined by either the cpuc or acc 
these rates are intended to allow recovery of operating costs and a reasonable rate of return on capital 
factors recently affecting our financial performance include the process and timing of setting rates charged to customers  our ability to recover  and the process for recovering  the costs of water and electricity in rates  weather  the impact of increased water quality standards on the cost of operations and capital expenditures  pressures on water supply caused by population growth  more stringent water quality standards  deterioration in water quality and water supply from a variety of causes  capital expenditures needed to upgrade water systems and increased costs and risks associated with litigation relating to water quality and water supply  including suits initiated by the company to protect its water supply 
for  net income was million compared to million in  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share for were compared to in  an increase of 
the increase in earnings per share was primarily due to a decision issued by the cpuc authorizing recovery of previously incurred costs related to the aerojet litigation  increased rates approved by the cpuc and acc and a significant increase in the unrealized gain on purchased power contracts related to our bear valley electric division due to increasing energy prices 
partially offsetting the increased rates were lower revenues due to decreased water consumption caused by near record rainfalls in southern california  higher operating costs  a higher effective tax rate and the dilutive effect of having more shares outstanding 
we plan to continue to seek additional rate increases in future years to recover our operating and supply costs and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
capital expenditures in future years are expected to remain at much higher levels than depreciation expense 
cash from operations is not expected to be sufficient to fund our cash needs for capital expenditures  dividends  investments in our contract business and other cash needs 
we expect to fund these needs through a combination of debt and common stock offerings in the next five years 
consolidated results of operations years ended december  and year year ended ended change change operating revenues water electric other total operating revenues operating expenses water purchased power purchased for pumping groundwater production assessment power purchased for resale unrealized loss on purchased power contracts gain on sale of water rights gain on settlement for removal of wells supply cost balancing accounts other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization maintenance taxes on income other taxes total operating expenses operating income other income loss net interest charges net income net income for the year ended december  increased to million  equivalent to and per common share  respectively  on a basic and fully diluted basis  compared to million or and per share  respectively  for the year ended december  impacting the comparability in the results of the two periods are the following significant items a decision issued by the cpuc on july  regarding the aerojet memorandum account which added about million to net income in july or approximately per share 
gswc was authorized to collect the balance of the aerojet litigation memorandum account of approximately million  through a rate surcharge  which will continue for no longer than years 
as a result of this decision  in july gswc recorded an increase of approximately million to the aerojet regulatory asset to include previously expensed carrying and other costs  and recorded a corresponding pretax gain 
in addition  gswc was ordered to restore to the appropriate plant accounts  those amounts that have been reimbursed by aerojet pursuant to the settlement 
this resulted in gswc recording an approximate million decrease to depreciation expense during the third quarter of the following summarizes the impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  resulting from this decision amount increase decrease operating expenses power purchased for resale other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization total pretax impact to operating expenses interest charges other interest and amortization of debt expense total pretax impact to results of operations impact to taxes on income total impact to net income impact to basic earnings per share impact to diluted earnings per share a significant increase in the unrealized gain on purchased power contracts due to increasing energy prices 
this unrealized gain added approximately million to pretax income  or per share  to the year ended december   as compared to the unrealized loss of  or less than per share  for the same period of a significant decrease in the supply cost balancing account 
during the year ended december   a reduction to the supply cost balancing account provision of approximately million was recorded pursuant to the approval by the cpuc in  of which million was for the increased supply costs incurred by gswc s region iii in and million was for years to furthermore  a cumulative million over collection in supply costs was recorded in may covering years to as a result of the advice letter filings pursuant to a new procedure set up by the cpuc 
this overall net reduction to the provision added about per share in water rate increases contributed approximately million to revenues  per share in the increases above were offset by the followings a decrease in billed water consumption due to near record rainfall in southern california in the decrease in consumption negatively impacted earnings in by approximately per share 
a favorable decision issued by the cpuc in that resulted in a million pretax gain on the sale of water rights during the second quarter of offset by an impairment loss of  associated with related assets removed from rate base pursuant to this decision 
this million net gain added approximately per share to the year ended december  there was no such gain in a higher effective tax rate reduced earnings by per share resulting from differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
increases in various administrative and general expenses and other operating expenses  as discussed below 
operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by million or compared to the year ended december  water revenues reflect rate increases in and covering almost all of gswc s water customers which contributed million in increased revenues and an increase in ccwc s rates effective october  which contributed approximately  in increased revenues  offset by a decrease of in billed water consumption due to near record rainfall in southern california in differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
the number of water customers remained relatively flat between the two years 
for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects a rate increase related to the commencement of operations of an mw natural gas fueled generation facility 
the new rates went into effect on april  the rate increase for this facility is expected to generate approximately million in additional annual revenues and is subject to refund pending cpuc s final cost review 
the new rates have been recognized in revenues as management believes it is probable that the final cpuc cost review will not result in refunds to the customer 
the increase was offset by a decrease in kilowatt hour consumption 
in the beginning of january february  the ski resorts did not use as much power for snowmaking due to sufficient snow fall 
at the beginning of this season october december  the temperatures were too warm for snowmaking 
the lack of snowmaking combined with the decrease in visitors to the area in the later part of due to the lack of snow resulted in the decrease in kilowatt hour consumption 
for the year ended december   other operating revenues increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to approximately million of additional revenues associated with the operation of the water and wastewater systems at fort bliss  located near el paso  texas that commenced on october  operating expenses for the year ended december  and  and  respectively  of the company s supply mix was purchased water 
purchased water costs increased slightly by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to increases in supplier rates offset by a decline in customer demand resulting from lower consumption 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to a decrease in kilowatt hour usage caused by lower customer demand 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments increased by as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to increases in assessment rates levied against groundwater production in regions ii and iii  effective july and average pump tax rates increased in regions ii and iii in july by approximately  and further increased by and  respectively  in july in addition  gswc received  for leasing temporary surplus water rights during the year ended december  which was recorded as a reduction to groundwater production assessments as compared to  received for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in well production due to a decline in customer demand 
for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bear valley electric division decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to two related events with mirant americas energy marketing mirant marketing 
the first event was the recording of additional one time costs for the year ended december  that did not recur in the additional one time costs recorded in was due to a refund to mirant marketing of  ordered by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in march of for the one time sale of excess energy in the spot market 
while this increased the cost of power purchased for resale  gswc also booked the refund payment to mirant marketing in its supply cost balancing account  therefore  there was no net impact on earnings in the second event was the result of a ferc order in november of in which ferc ordered mirant marketing to reimburse  of the amount gswc had refunded to mirant marketing 
gswc received the reimbursement of  plus interest  from mirant marketing in may of gswc recorded the mirant marketing reimbursement in its supply cost balancing account which also resulted in no net impact on earnings in in addition  there was a decrease of  which was caused by increases in gswc s sales of surplus energy into spot market in  compared to net sales of surplus in finally  there was a  decrease in fuel costs due to less frequent operation of the new generating plant in compared to the new generating plant  which went into service during the fourth quarter of  is only operated when it is believed to be economical 
it was operated more frequently in to acquire the air quality permit and to verify the warranty before its expiration in september of unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represents gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with pinnacle west capital corporation pwcc  which qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the  pretax unrealized gain on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to an increase in the current forward market prices since december  as of december   gswc has recorded a cumulative unrealized gain of million on its balance sheet since the inception of these contracts 
unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc  which terminates in for the year ended december   registrant recorded a million pretax gain on the sale of water rights reflecting a favorable cpuc decision in the million represented settlement proceeds received in may from the city of santa monica relating to the sale and the assignment of rights regarding the charnock groundwater basin 
for the year ended december   registrant recorded a net pretax gain of  on a settlement reached with the fountain hills sanitary district fhsd in february for the capping of two ccwc wells in order to facilitate fhsd s ability to secure certain permits 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  ccwc agreed to permanently remove from service and cap one of its wells  and cap another well which had never been used as a potable source of supply 
a decrease of million during the year ended december  in the provision for supply cost balancing accounts as compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects i the recording in of a net million regulatory liability with a corresponding charge booked to the supply cost balancing account provision representing potential refund of supply costs from late to  ii approval by the cpuc in june and october to recover an approximate million under collection in region iii s memorandum supply cost accounts  iii the recording of million in net under collections in all water regions for s memorandum supply cost accounts  iv a decrease in of  in amortization based on previously authorized surcharges to either collect or refund balances primarily related to pre november water supply cost balancing accounts and the electric balancing account  and v a decrease of  in the electric supply cost amounts in excess of the per mwh recovery cap authorized by the cpuc 
these decreases were offset by the net refunds to mirant marketing previously discussed in cost of power purchased for resale in gswc s bear valley electric service area 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i higher labor costs as a result of higher wages and employee headcount which increased by approximately  at gswc  ii higher net operating expenses of  at asus due to the commencement of operations of the water and wastewater system at fort bliss  iii higher chemicals and water treatment costs of  at gswc  and iv an impairment loss of  recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the final decision issued by the cpuc in region iii s general rate case 
these increases were offset by i a one time write off related to an impairment loss of  that was recorded at the end of the second quarter of related to the charnock groundwater basin assets being removed from rate base pursuant to a cpuc order in  and ii a  adjustment in the third quarter of reflecting the approval from the cpuc of recovery of previously incurred operating expenses in the aerojet memorandum account 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to i an approximate million increase in pensions and benefits due to changes in actuarial assumptions with respect to the discount rate and mortality tables used in calculating the expense  and increases of approximately million in various other benefit costs due primarily to increases in medical and labor costs  and bonuses earned in of approximately  which were not earned in  ii an approximate  increase in gswc s general office labor costs due to higher wages  and iii an approximate  increase at fbws due to the commencement of operations of the water and wastewater system at fort bliss 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in outside services in connection with new business development and other matters  and ii a net decrease of approximately  in various other miscellaneous expenses 
for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of recording approximately million in additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january this increase was offset by a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from the cpuc decision on the aerojet matter  discussed previously  which ordered gswc to restore approximately million to the appropriate plant accounts and decrease depreciation expense 
registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased slightly by compared to the year ended december  there was higher maintenance expense of  due principally to increases in scheduled maintenance and emergency repairs at gswc s region iii and an increase of  in maintenance expenses for fbws due to the commencement of operations at fort bliss in october each of the military utility privatization subsidiaries bears the risk of increases in maintenance and all other costs above those authorized in the contract for operation of the water and wastewater systems for the us army and air force  unless it is entitled to an equitable adjustment for such matters as an increase in labor rates  changes in circumstances or differing site conditions from those anticipated at the time of execution of the contract 
these increases were offset by decreases in maintenance expense at gswc s regions i  ii and bear valley electric of  as well as decreases at ccwc of  for the year ended december   taxes on operating income increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due  in part  to an increase in pretax operating income of 
in addition  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  increased to as compared to a effective tax rate applicable to the year ended december  the variance between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily the result of differences between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through adjustments in accordance with regulatory requirements 
flow through adjustments increase or decrease tax expense in one period  with an offsetting decrease or increase occurring in another period 
during the year ended december   the recognition of the federal benefit of state taxes was adjusted to conform to the flow through method reflected in the tax calculation for ratemaking purposes  which partially defers the recognition of the benefit to the subsequent tax year 
this resulted in additional income taxes of approximately million 
for the year ended december   other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting an increase of approximately  in additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes of approximately  based on increased labor costs 
other income loss for the year ended december   other income loss  net was a loss of  as compared to income of  for the year ended december  this was largely due to a reduction recorded in september of gswc s estimate of customer refunds associated with lease revenues from the city of folsom 
interest charges for the year ended december   interest charges decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting the approval from the cpuc of previously incurred and expensed carrying costs totaling million in the aerojet memorandum account  discussed previously 
this was offset by increases in short term borrowings and higher interest rates on short term borrowings of approximately  and increases in long term debt interest expense of  due to  of additional private placement notes issued in october in addition  during the first quarter of gswc recorded the recovery of carrying costs of approximately  with respect to the costs incurred in connection with the cpuc s investigation of water quality matters relating to public utilities regulated by the cpuc which was authorized by the cpuc in march there was no corresponding recovery in consolidated results of operations years ended december  and year year ended ended change change operating revenues water electric other total operating revenues operating expenses water purchased power purchased for pumping power purchased for resale unrealized loss on purchased power contracts gain on sale of water rights groundwater production assessment supply cost balancing accounts other operating expenses administrative and general expenses depreciation and amortization maintenance taxes on income other taxes total operating expenses operating income other income loss net interest charges net income net income for the year ended december  increased by to million  equivalent to and per common share on basic and fully diluted bases  respectively  compared to million or per share for the year ended december  the increase in recorded results reflects increased rates in each of the three gswc water regions that were effective during the first quarter of  offset by an increase in i supply costs due to more purchased water in gswc s resource mix  and ii increases in administrative and general expenses due to higher outside services and pension costs 
in addition  there was a favorable decision issued by the cpuc on july  that resulted in a million net pretax increase in operating income 
gswc received million in may of from the city of santa monica city pursuant to a settlement agreement in which gswc sold its water rights in the charnock groundwater basin basin to the city and assigned to the city its rights against all potentially responsible parties who stored  transported and dispensed gasoline containing methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in underground storage tanks  pipelines or other related infrastructure in the basin 
the total proceeds of million from the sale and the assignment of rights were offset by an impairment loss of  associated with assets removed from rate base  pursuant to the decision 
gswc recorded the impairment loss on assets removed from rate base in other operating expenses 
operating revenues for the year ended december   revenues from water operations increased by to million  compared to million for the year ended december  higher water revenues reflect an increase of in water consumption resulting from changes in weather conditions that contributed to an increase in revenues of approximately million 
differences in temperature and rainfall in registrant s service areas impact sales of water to customers  causing fluctuations in registrant s revenues and earnings between comparable periods 
additionally  the cpuc in its march  decision authorized an annualized increase of approximately million in revenues for gswc s region iii service area that was effective on march  and increased revenues by approximately million in in addition  in august  the cpuc approved rate increases for regions i and ii that became effective retroactive to january and february  respectively 
this also contributed to the increase in water revenues between the two periods of approximately million in for the year ended december   revenues from electric operations increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects primarily an increase of in kilowatt hour consumption 
for the year ended december   other operating revenues increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to approximately  of additional revenues associated with the operation of the water and wastewater systems at fort bliss  located near el paso  texas that commenced on october  in addition  there was a  increase in asus s contracted services 
operating expenses for the year ended december   of the company s supply mix was purchased water as compared to purchased water for the year ended december  purchased water costs increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to additional purchases of water to replace groundwater supply lost due to wells being removed from service 
the wells were removed from service as a result of water quality issues and mechanical problems  particularly in gswc s metropolitan and foothill districts 
together  the cost of purchased water in these districts increased by approximately million 
in addition  increases in the other districts totaled million due to increases in water consumption and supplier rates 
finally  approximately  was incurred beginning in june in connection with the trucking of water in gswc s wrightwood customer service area due to a continued decline in water levels and production capacity in the existing wells 
with the completion and placing into service of a new well  gswc stopped hauling water in august gswc has hired an engineering consultant to assist in finding a long term answer to the water supply for the wrightwood community 
in the interim  the wet weather in southern california during the first quarter of has been beneficial to groundwater levels in the wrightwood area 
changes in the water resource mix between water supplied from purchased sources and that supplied from registrant s own wells can increase decrease actual supply related costs relative to that approved for recovery through rates  thereby impacting earnings either negatively or positively 
registrant has the opportunity to change the supply related costs recovered through rates by application to the appropriate regulatory body 
registrant believes that its applications for recovery of supply related costs accurately reflect the water supply situation as it is known at the time 
however  it is impossible to adequately protect earnings from adverse changes in supply costs related to unforeseen contamination or other loss of water supply 
for the year ended december   the cost of power purchased for pumping decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due to additional wells being taken out of service due to water quality issues and for unscheduled maintenance which resulted in increased purchased water and less pumping  the effects of which were partially offset by higher consumption 
for the year ended december   cost of power purchased for resale to customers in gswc s bear valley electric division increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the reversal in of a  gain generated from a one time sale of energy on the spot market in april the gain  which was previously recorded in april to the supply cost balancing account  was ordered by the ferc in march to be refunded  plus interest  to mirant marketing 
this refund increased the cost of power purchased for resale during the year ended december   with a corresponding decrease in the supply cost balancing account included in the statement of income 
there was no net impact on earnings 
the sale of excess energy on the spot market in resulted from a one month overlap of energy purchase agreements 
in addition  there was a  increase in natural gas cost for the new megawatt generator that went on line in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by  of decreased purchased power for resale resulting from certain refunds and credits 
unrealized gain and loss on purchased power contracts represents gains and losses recorded for gswc s purchased power agreements with pwcc  which qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the  pretax unrealized loss on purchased power contracts for the year ended december  is due to a decrease in the current forward market prices between december  and december  unrealized gains and losses at bear valley electric will continue to impact earnings during the life of the contract with pwcc  which terminates in for the year ended december   registrant recorded a million gain on the sale of water rights reflecting a favorable cpuc decision on july  as discussed previously  the million represents settlement proceeds received in may from the city of santa monica relating to the sale and the assignment of rights regarding the charnock groundwater basin 
for the year ended december   groundwater production assessments decreased by as compared to the year ended december  due to i a reduction in pumped water production by approximately and  ii gswc s receipt of  for leasing excess water rights during the year ended december  as compared to receipt of  during the year ended december  these excess water rights are recorded as a reduction to groundwater production assessments 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in assessment rates levied against groundwater production  effective july and the decrease in pumped water costs was due primarily to wells in the metropolitan and foothill districts being down for maintenance and water quality reasons 
this resulted in increased purchased water and less pumping 
a decrease of million during the year ended december  in the provision for supply cost balancing accounts as compared to the year ended december  primarily reflects the recording of a probable refund of million to customers representing the net proceeds received from the potentially responsible parties prps with respect to the charnock basin contamination  pursuant to a proposed decision issued by the cpuc in december  which was finalized in july in addition  there was the  refund to mirant marketing  previously discussed in cost of power purchased for resale 
these decreases were offset by the recording of million net over collection in the water memorandum supply cost accounts as a regulatory liability during  with a corresponding charge booked to the provision for supply cost balancing account 
this followed gswc s filing of advice letters for regions i and ii related to the memorandum supply cost accounts on april  as a result  in may  gswc began recording the net over collection as a regulatory liability 
for the year ended december   other operating expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i an impairment loss totaling  recorded in june of related to the charnock groundwater basin assets being removed from rate base pursuant to the cpuc order on july   ii higher labor costs which increased by approximately  iii higher operating expenses of  at asus due to the commencement of operations of the water and wastewater system at fort bliss  iv the receipt of  in in connection with a settlement agreement with a prp for the contamination of one of gswc s wells for previously incurred outside services in connection with this issue  there was no similar reimbursements in  and v increases in various other operating expenses 
for the year ended december   administrative and general expenses increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to i an approximately  increase in outside legal and consulting services incurred in connection with new business development  most specifically in the area of privatization of water and wastewater systems at military bases  ii approximately  increase in outside services related to sarbanes oxley compliance requirements  iii approximately million increase in pensions and benefits due to actuarial assumption changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and increases in various benefit costs  iv the reversal of  and million in water quality related reserves into income during the first quarter and fourth quarter of  respectively  and v approximately  increase in general rate case expenses 
registrant believes that prudent administrative expenses approved in advance by state regulators to be incurred in the operation and management of its regulated subsidiaries will be recovered through water and electric rates 
amounts included in each general rate case are estimated for future years 
overages from those estimates are not covered in rates 
for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting  among other things  the effects of recording approximately million in additions to utility plant during  depreciation on which began in january in addition  region ii s general rate case was approved in august by the cpuc  which increased the depreciation composite rates retroactive to february  to match the timing of revenue recovery 
this resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately  for the year ended december  registrant anticipates that depreciation expense will continue to increase due to registrant s on going construction program at its regulated subsidiaries 
registrant believes that depreciation expense related to property additions approved by the appropriate regulatory agency will be recovered through water and electric rates 
for the year ended december   maintenance expense increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due principally to an increase in required maintenance on gswc s wells and water supply sources  an increase in main leaks and resultant emergency repairs  and acceleration of certain scheduled maintenance projects 
these maintenance increases are included in each general rate case for approval to be recovered in rates 
for the year ended december   taxes on operating income increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due  in part  to an increase in pretax operating income of 
in addition  the effective tax rate applicable to the year ended december  reflects an increase of approximately five percentage points to as compared to a effective tax rate applicable to the year ended december  associated with this increase was a net positive increase in differences principally related to compensatory and deferred rate case expenses between book and taxable income that are treated as flow through items 
positive flow through differences increase tax expense in one year  with an offsetting decrease in tax expense occurring in another year 
for the year ended december   other taxes increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  reflecting additional property taxes resulting from higher assessed values  and increases in payroll taxes based on increased labor costs 
other income loss for the year ended december   other net income increased to  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  this is a result of a cpuc decision on march  that ordered gswc to refund percent of the total amount of lease revenues received form the city of folsom since  plus interest  to customers 
pursuant to the order  for the year ended december  gswc recorded a million charge against non operating income less million of taxes 
in addition  during there was a million reduction in gswc s estimate of customer refunds associated with lease revenues from the city of folsom 
interest charges for the year ended december   interest expense decreased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  due primarily to repayment of million of long term debt in october of and recovery of carrying costs of approximately  on the costs incurred in the water quality order instituting investigation matter authorized by the cpuc in march  partially offset by increases in short term borrowings
