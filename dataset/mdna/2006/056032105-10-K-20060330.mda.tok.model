we manufacture reflow furnaces for printed circuit board assembly as well as semiconductor wafer level and die level packaging equipment 
we also provide thermal process equipment for the solar cell  fuel cell and nuclear fuel industries 
our customers require high throughput  high yield and highly reliable thermal processing systems with tightly controlled temperature and atmosphere parameters 
our convection solder reflow systems are used to attach electronic components to printed circuit boards  primarily in the advanced high density surface mount segments of the market 
in the semiconductor market  we participate in both wafer level and die level packaging  where our thermal processing systems are used to connect and seal integrated circuits into a package 
our customers in the energy generation market use our thermal systems to process advanced ceramics and metal alloys which are used in fuel cell  solar cell and nuclear fuel applications 
in  we began manufacturing and material sourcing operations in a leased facility in shanghai  china 
during  we began construction of additional leased facilities  which will be fully operational in the second quarter of in china  which are needed for further expansion in the asia pacific region 
in addition  in  we expanded our product development capability to china  creating a global engineering team 
this team developed and commercially introduced our latest pyramax product and continues to collaborate on additional product initiatives 
in the past year  we have substantially improved our us and global supply chain and reduced our materials costs 
these efforts have resulted in a major improvement in gross margins in primarily our pyramax product line  manufactured in both our us and china factories 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of those accounting policies that we deem to be critical that is  they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and they reflect management s reliance on estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as updated by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and payment is reasonably assured 
under these requirements  we recognize revenue upon acceptance when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions and compliance with those provisions has not been previously demonstrated 
furthermore  we recognize revenue upon completion of installation for products that require installation for which the installation is 
table of contents essential to functionality or is not inconsequential or perfunctory 
revenue for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon shipment with estimated installation and warranty costs accrued 
applying the requirements of sab no 
and sab no 
to future sales arrangements used in our equipment sales may result in the deferral of the revenue for some equipment sales 
we also have certain sales transactions for products which are not completed within the normal operating cycle of the business 
it is our policy to account for these transactions using the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition purposes when all of the following criteria exist we received the purchase order or entered into a legally binding contract  the customer is credit worthy and collection is probable or customer prepayments are required at product completion milestones or specific dates  the sales value of the product to be delivered is significant in amount when compared to our other products  and the costs can be reasonably estimated  there is no major technological uncertainty and the total engineering  material procurement  product assembly and test cycle time extend over a period of six months or longer 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and gross margins to date are recognized based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared to the latest estimate of total costs to complete the product as a percentage of the total contract revenue for the product 
revisions in costs and gross margin percentage estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts causing the revision become known 
provisions for total estimated losses on uncompleted contracts  if any  are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
inventory valuation 
our inventories consist of material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we determine the cost of inventory based on the first in  first out method 
we regularly review the quantity of inventories on hand and compare these quantities to the expected usage of each applicable product or product line 
our inventories are adjusted in value to the lower of costs and or net realizable value 
since the value of our inventories depends in part on our estimates of each product s net realizable value  adjustments may be needed to reflect changes in valuation 
any adjustments we are required to make to lower the value of the inventories are recorded as a charge to cost of sales 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated

restructuring 
in the third quarter of  the company recorded a million restructuring charge 
in summary  these charges were the result of a redirection of development programs  resulting in the write off of assets including the impairment of goodwill from an acquisition  and severance costs  primarily related to the departure of the previous ceo 
sagarus robotics corporation was acquired in april with the intent to use the technology acquired to provide us supplied robotic automation in its wafer bump processing equipment 
the 
table of contents company s efforts have proven commercially unsuccessful and we decided to supply robotic automation on its equipment from other established automation vendors 
approximately million of the million restructuring charge is related to asset write offs k goodwill  k inventory and severance costs as a result of a redirection of the company s development programs for robotic automation of its wafer bump processing equipment 
this million portion of the restructuring charge represents the company s decision to abandon its plans for btu supplied robotic automation and instead  offer for sale with its thermal processing equipment commercially available robotics from other existing robotic suppliers 
the remaining approximately million charge is primarily for the severance costs of the former ceo 
payments may continue until september the company reduced its billerica  ma work force by employees direct labor  manufacturing engineering and finance with an expected annual savings of million 
severance payments for these reductions will end in the first quarter of in the second quarter  the company reduced its overhead personnel to better align its spending with the reduced level of sales 
the  restructuring charge represents severance costs for the laid off employees

accordingly  no income tax benefit is reflected in the statement of operations at december  the company s statutory federal income tax rate is 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during  we used net cash resources of approximately million for operating activities 
this use of cash was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  adding back depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in liabilities of million  and a net profit of million 
on december   we sold  shares of our common stock in a secondary offering raising approximately million in net cash to support our growth requirements

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the compensation cost related to share based payment transactions with employees in the financial statements 
the compensation cost is measured based upon the fair value of the instrument issued 
share based compensation transactions with employees covered within sfas r include stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas included a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees  but allowed companies to continue to apply the guidance in apb provided that they disclose in the footnotes to the financial statements the pro forma net income if the fair value based method been applied 
sfas r requires the use of either the modified prospective application or modified retrospective application transition method 
the modified prospective application transition method requires the application of this standard to all new awards issued after the effective date  all modifications  repurchased or cancellations of existing awards after the effective date  and unvested awards at the effective date 

table of contents for unvested awards  the compensation cost related to the remaining requisite service that has not been rendered at the effective date will be determined by the compensation cost calculated currently for disclosure purposes under sfas we will be adopting the modified prospective application of sfas r 
based on the current options outstanding  we anticipate the adoption of this statement will not result in the recognition of material additional compensation cost 
sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas was issued in november sfas reinforces that abnormal levels of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage are required to be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead
