management overview fiscal represents the company s fifteenth consecutive profitable year 
the overall success of fiscal was not without challenges 
the first half of fiscal was a pivotal period for the company 
we expanded our casual fashion assortments  while reducing our key item and dress business 
these repositioning efforts created lower gross margins for the first half  gross profits as a percentage of net sales in the first half decreased to from in fiscal during the second half of fiscal  our consumer responded well to the increased penetration of casual fashions versus basics 
also  we reduced the quantity per style being offered  which we believe created a greater sense of urgency for the customer 
the second half gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  the company will focus on its sourcing strategy and has already hired an executive vice president of production and sourcing to lead this initiative 
the merchandising team had in the past also been responsible for sourcing 
we believe that having a separate area responsible for this integral process will enhance consistent flow and quality of product 
the company opened stores in fiscal  cache and lillie rubin stores and closed cache stores 
operating cash flow funded all store openings 
in fiscal  we intend to open approximately stores consisting of cache and lillie rubin stores  also intended to be funded by operating cash flow 
in fiscal  the company remodeled cache stores and lillie rubin  approximately of the chain is now in the new format 
in spring  the company intends to roll out a new pos system to all locations 
the new systems will allow the company to then go forward with a customer loyalty program in late  which will link to the company s direct marketing 
the company is optimistic about its opportunity for success in fiscal management will continue to offer the consumer the most current fashion trends in a boutique setting with high levels of customer service 
we use a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance to evaluate the performance of our business  some of which are set forth in the following table weeks ended weeks ended weeks ended december  january  december  operating results total store count  at end of period net sales growth comparable store sales growth net sales per square foot total square footage in thousands net sales 
net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores 
a store is not included in comparable store sales until the first day of the fiscal month following the twelfth full month of sales 
non comparable store sales include sales generated at new stores prior to the period when they are considered comparable stores and sales generated from stores that we have since closed

amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales at the time of shipment 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise  cost of freight from vendors  costs incurred for shipping and handling  payroll for our design  buying and merchandising personnel and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  contingent rents  common area maintenance and real estate taxes

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that had been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation  which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
finite long lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite long lived assets  we perform an analysis by store of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
no impairment charges were incurred in fiscal  and  respectively 
self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for fiscal  and further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter transaction or upon receipt by a customer 
sales of merchandise via our website are recognized at the expected time of delivery to the customer 
our customers have the right to return merchandise 
sales are reported net of actual and estimated returns 
we maintain a reserve for potential product returns and record  as a reduction to sales  a provision for estimated product returns  which is determined based on historical experience 
charges or credits to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision were approximately   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees are included in net sales at the time of shipment 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the company reserves for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the contingent amount is reasonably estimable 
these reserves are based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions as well as various tax filing positions 
due to the complexity of these examination issues   has been accrued to date 
seasonality 
we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in net sales and operating income 
quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  fashion trends and shifts in timing of certain holidays 
our business is subject to seasonal influences  characterized by highest sales during the fourth quarter october  november and december and lowest sales during the third quarter july  august and september 
results of operations the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of net sales

net sales increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
fiscal net sales included a fifty third week  on a comparable basis  assuming a fifty two week year in both periods  total sales would have risen by approximately in fiscal the actual increase in fiscal net sales as compared to fiscal reflects million of additional net sales primarily due to a increase in comparable store sales 
comparable store sales were higher in the second half of fiscal  rising  as compared to a increase during the first half of fiscal this improvement resulted from a change in the merchandise assortment in the second half of fiscal  to reflect a greater proportion of fashion forward merchandise 
the increase in full year fiscal sales was also partially attributable to the increase in accessory sales  which increased to of total sales for cache stores in fiscal  from of sales in fiscal the remainder of the increase in sales was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores and new stores 
we believe our new store expansion  planned at approximately new stores in fiscal  will help to increase sales during the next fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to from 
this increase in gross profit was the combined result of higher net sales and an increase in gross profit margins  due to improved inventory management  which led to an increase in initial markup as compared to fiscal partially offsetting the increase in gross margins was an increase in occupancy costs  which rose an additional of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in new stores opened in late and during we believe it generally takes three years for new stores to reach maturity levels  which provide positive leverage for occupancy costs 
we estimate that excluding the fifty third week from fiscal results  gross profit would have risen by an additional approximately in fiscal we will seek to increase gross margin rates in fiscal and beyond by establishing our own in house production department 
to that end  in march we hired a vice president of production and sourcing  to assist in this effort 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this was due primarily to an increase in the total number of new stores open

the increases in depreciation and taxes were partially attributable to the increase in new stores  as well as an increase in store remodels 
excluding the fifty third week from fiscal results  we estimate that store operating expenses would have risen by approximately in fiscal we anticipate that store operating expenses will decrease  as a percent of net sales in future years  as comparable store sales rise in our newer locations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to from 
this increase was primarily attributable to increase in corporate level payroll of  as well as an increase in incentive compensation expense of  rising to of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and was partially offset by a reduction in travel expense of  decreasing to of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal 
excluding the fifty third week from fiscal results  we estimate that general and administrative expenses would have been of net sales 
other income 
other income increased to million from  primarily attributable to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates in fiscal  as compared to fiscal other income generally consists of interest income 
we expect interest income to grow in the future due to stronger cash flows from operations 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased to million from million  a decrease of  below the same period last year 
the overall effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a reversal of overaccrued state income taxes 
an increase in tax free interest from municipal bond investments in the first half of fiscal also contributed to the reduction in effective rate during fiscal refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of the income tax provision 
net income 
as a result of the foregoing  net increased to million from million  as compared to the same period last year

the remainder of the increase was the result of additional net sales from non comparable stores 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million from million  an increase of million  or  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was the combined result of higher net sales  partially due to the additional one week of sales in the fiscal period and increased gross profit margins

income taxes increased to million from million  an increase of  over the prior fiscal year 
this increase was attributable to higher taxable income  and was partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the overall effective income tax rate is primarily attributable to a reversal of state income tax over accrued in prior fiscal years

quarterly results and seasonality we experience seasonal and quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and operating income

we have historically satisfied our cash requirements principally through cash flow from operations 
cash flows have increased significantly in recent years  due to the dramatic increase in gross margin contribution 
as of december   we had working capital of million  which included cash and marketable securities of million 
the following table sets forth our cash flows for the period indicated in thousands weeks ended december  weeks ended january  weeks ended december  net cash from operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash from financing activities net increase decrease  in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in deferred taxes and an increase in prepaid expenses of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in deferred taxes of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million and a tax benefit of million from stock option exercises  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories of million primarily due to the net increase of stores  reversal of deferred rent of million  and an increase in receivables of million 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities due primarily to net income  depreciation of million  an increase in accrued liabilities and compensation of million  and an increase in accounts payable of million and a tax benefit of million from stock option exercises  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventories of million  primarily due to the net increase of stores 
cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal these amounts were used for the purchase of marketable securities  as well as the payment for equipment and leasehold improvements in new and remodeled stores 
our capital requirements depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
projected capital expenditures for fiscal to fund new store openings and remodelings are approximately to million 
based on our experience with new store openings  we estimate that the average net investment to open new stores is approximately  to  which includes new store opening expenses and initial inventory  net of landlord contributions 
we estimate that the average net investment to remodel an existing store is approximately  to  net of landlord contributions 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  in fiscal  primarily due to cash provided from the proceeds of common stock issuances 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  primarily due to stock option exercises and stock issuances 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from stock issuances and stock option exercises 
we have a line of credit with fleet bank  na  permitting us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
at december   there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a maximum annual rate equal to the bank s prime rate  currently at february   less 
the agreement relating to this facility contains selected financial and other covenants 
in addition  the credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures  incur indebtedness or create or incur liens on our assets 
while this facility is unsecured  if a default occurs under the facility  we are required to grant the lender a security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
we have at all times been in compliance with all loan covenants 
this facility currently expires in november we believe that cash flow from operations  our current available cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and contemplated new store opening expenses for at least the next months 
if our cash flow from operations should decline significantly or if we should accelerate our store expansion or remodeling program  it may be necessary for us to seek additional sources of capital

the operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk relates primarily to changes in interest rates 
we bear the risk in two specific ways 
first  the revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  the statement of income and cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no borrowing under our credit facility 
however  we may borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  as needed 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are included in cash and equivalents as well as marketable securities on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations
