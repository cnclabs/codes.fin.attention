critical accounting policy and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of farmer mac s financial condition and results of operations and requires complex  subjective judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is presented in three components on its consolidated balance sheet an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned  and an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
farmer mac s provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated statement of operations a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
the purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated losses that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date  and not to predict or account for future potential losses 
the determination of the allowance for losses requires management to make significant estimates based on information available as of the balance sheet date  including the amounts and timing of losses and current market and economic conditions 
these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information change 
for example  a decline in the national or agricultural economy could result in an increase in delinquencies or foreclosures  which may require additional allowances for losses in future periods 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
historically  farmer mac estimated probable losses using a systematic process that began with management s evaluation of the results of a proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model 
that model drew upon historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans screened to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those eligible for farmer mac s programs 
the results generated by that model were then modified  as necessary  by the application of management s judgment 
during third quarter  farmer mac completed the planned migration of its methodology for determining its allowance for losses away from one based on its loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model to one based on its own historical portfolio loss experience and credit trends 
farmer mac recorded the effects of that change as a change in accounting estimate as of september  farmer mac s new methodology for determining its allowance for losses incorporates the corporation s proprietary automated loan classification system 
that system scores loans based on criteria such as historical repayment performance  loan seasoning  loan size and ltv 
for the purposes of the loss allowance methodology  the loans in farmer mac s portfolio of loans and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs have been scored and classified for each calendar quarter since first quarter the new allowance methodology captures the migration of loan scores across concurrent and overlapping year time horizons and calculates loss rates separately within each loan classification for loans underlying ltspcs and loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities 
the calculated loss rates are applied to the current classification distribution of farmer mac s portfolio to estimate inherent losses  on the assumption that the historical credit losses and trends used to calculate loss rates will continue in the future 
management evaluates this assumption by taking into consideration several factors  including economic conditions  geographic and agricultural commodity product concentrations in the portfolio  the credit profile of the portfolio  delinquency trends of the portfolio  and historical charge off and recovery activities of the portfolio 
if  based on that evaluation  management concludes that the assumption is not valid  the loss allowance calculation is modified by the addition of further assumptions to capture current portfolio trends and characteristics that differ from historical experience 
the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses charged to operating expenses and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries 
negative provisions for loan losses or negative provisions for losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable losses as of the end of a period is lower than the estimate at the beginning of the period 
the establishment of and periodic adjustments to the valuation allowance for real estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
as of december   farmer mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future

as part of farmer mac s continuing evaluation of the overall credit quality of its portfolio  the state of the us agricultural economy  the recent upward trends in agricultural land values  the level of farmer mac s outstanding guarantees and commitments and the recordation of a change in accounting estimate resulting from the implementation during third quarter of a new methodology to estimate probable losses inherent in its post act farmer mac i portfolio  farmer mac determined that the appropriate level of allowance for losses as of december  was million 
this resulted in the release of approximately million from the allowance for losses during  compared to the release of million from its allowance for losses in and provisions for losses of million in during  the release from the allowance for losses included million recorded as a change in accounting estimate in third quarter as of december   the allowance for losses was million and basis points relative to the outstanding post act farmer mac i portfolio  compared to million and basis points as of september  and million and basis points as of december  for further discussion of the change in the allowance for losses and provision for losses  see risk management credit risk loans

during and  farmer mac recovered approximately million and million  respectively  from sellers one of which was zions first national bank  a related party  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements for breaches of representations and warranties associated with prior sales of agricultural mortgage loans to farmer mac  which amounts farmer mac had previously charged off as losses on the associated loans  consistent with its policy on accounting for claims for breaches of representations and warranties 
as these payments are received from sellers rather than borrowers  these recoveries are reported as income and are not reflected as recoveries in the net losses charged against the allowance for losses 
as of december   approximately billion percent of farmer mac s portfolio of post act farmer mac i loans and loans underlying ltspcs and farmer mac guaranteed securities were in their peak default years approximately years three through five after origination  compared to billion percent as of december  and billion percent as of december  notwithstanding the recent historical trends in delinquency rates and the overall agricultural economy  during  the level of day delinquencies could increase and higher charge offs could follow 
outlook for usda s most recent publications as available on usda s website as of march  forecast net cash farm income to be billion  following record years of billion in and billion in net farm income to be billion  which is a decrease of billion from but still slightly above the year average net farm income of billion 
total direct us government payments to be billion in  down from the forecast of billion for  but still higher than the estimate of billion for direct payment rates are fixed in legislation and are not affected by the level of program crop prices 
countercyclical payments are forecast to increase from billion in to billion in marketing loan benefits are projected to be down to billion in from billion in the value of us farm real estate to increase percent in to trillion  as compared to the increase of percent  and the general economy to improve and so support further growth in farmland values 
the amount of farm real estate debt to increase by percent in to billion  compared to billion in the usda forecasts referenced above relate to us agriculture generally  but should be favorable for farmer mac s financial condition relative to its exposure to outstanding guarantees and commitments  as they indicate strong borrower cash flows  and generally increased values in us farm real estate 
while farmer mac s business volume in was somewhat greater than in  farmer mac s new business with agricultural mortgage lenders continues to be constrained by high levels of available capital and liquidity of agricultural lenders  alternative sources of funding and credit enhancement for agricultural lenders  increased competition in the secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans  reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market  due largely to the strong liquidity of many farmers and ranchers  and the lower rate of growth of the farm credit system mortgage portfolio  reducing the demand for ltspcs 
as a matter of historical practice  many financial institutions have preferred to retain agricultural mortgage loans in their portfolios rather than sell the loans into the secondary market 
that preference persists notwithstanding the corporate finance and capital planning benefits these institutions might otherwise realize through participation in farmer mac s programs  such as greater liquidity  greater lending capacity  increased return on equity  and decreased capital requirements 
in recent years  the preference to retain loans has been reinforced by the stronger capital and liquidity positions of agricultural lenders  combined with their willingness to accept greater asset and liability mismatch in light of the typically significant differential between lower  short term interest rates and higher  long term rates 
those stronger capital and liquidity positions  in turn  have increased competition in the origination  funding and acquisition for investment of the limited supply of new agricultural real estate mortgage lending opportunities 
limited supply and increased demand by fcs institutions  insurance companies  commercial banks and other financial institutions for agricultural mortgage loans have narrowed the investment returns on those loans  as has the ability of some lending institutions to subsidize  in effect  their agricultural mortgage loan rates through low return use of equity 
these conditions have limited the need for many agricultural lenders to obtain the benefits of farmer mac s programs 
farmer mac expects these conditions to continue through at least see business volume 
farmer mac faces significant challenges in its efforts to regain its past growth rates in annual business volume 
outstanding farmer mac program volume as of december  was billion  which represented percent of management s estimate of a billion market of eligible agricultural mortgage loans 
as part of its efforts to capture a greater share of the market  farmer mac is proceeding with its alliances with agstar financial services  aca  a related party fcs institution  and with the american bankers association 
farmer mac envisions additional longer term opportunities that could lead to expanded growth in business volume as a result of the corporation s marketing efforts 
further  farmer mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio transactions similar to those that have accounted for a significant portion of growth in the current and prior years continue to exist  but  in light of market conditions  no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of such transactions 
while farmer mac will continue to market actively its existing secondary market products  it also must address the constraints of the existing business environment  consistent with its charter and purposes 
farmer mac continues to develop and implement innovative means of serving the financing needs of rural america  and remains confident of opportunities for increased business volume and income growth 
those opportunities  which are a result of the corporation s product development  marketing and customer service efforts  are exemplified by the alliance farmer mac formed with the american bankers association and launched in the fall of  that alliance includes unique product pricing and services with potential for future business generation 
farmer mac has diversified its marketing focus to include large program transactions that emphasize high asset quality  with greater protection against adverse credit performance and commensurately lower compensation for the assumption of credit risk and administrative costs  resulting in marginal returns on equity equal to or better than the current net return on equity 
in january  as a result of those efforts  farmer mac guaranteed million principal amount of agvantage securities supported by a five year mortgage backed obligation of metropolitan life insurance company that is backed by eligible agricultural mortgage loans 
management expects these business opportunities to enhance farmer mac s mission accomplishment and net income 
farmer mac continues to actively evaluate new loan programs intended to provide for new  diversified business opportunities 
in that regard  the board and management are pursuing initiatives that include agribusiness  federal and state agricultural finance programs  new arrangements to encourage agricultural mortgage sales by banks  and rural development associated with agriculture 
some of the agribusiness and rural development initiatives will require farmer mac to consider credit risks that expand upon or differ from those the corporation has accepted previously 
farmer mac will use underwriting standards appropriate to those credit risks  and will draw as necessary upon outside expertise to analyze and evaluate the credit and funding aspects of loans submitted pursuant to those initiatives 
while farmer mac is seeking actively to expand its mix of loan types within the scope of its congressional charter  investors are cautioned that it is too early to assess the probability of success of these efforts 
while developing its business prospects  farmer mac has continued to validate and enhance its risk management practices  internal controls  accounting and financial reporting as a result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of regulatory considerations  including the sarbanes oxley act of and fca requirements  as well as the general regulatory environment for gses 
a detailed presentation of farmer mac s financial results for the years ended december   and follows 
net interest income 
net interest income was million for  million for and million for the net interest yield was basis points for the year ended december   compared to basis points for the year ended december  and basis points for the year ended december  net interest income includes guarantee fees for loans purchased after april  the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  but not for loans purchased prior to that date 
the effect of sfas was a reclassification of approximately million basis points of guarantee fee income as interest income for the year ended december   compared to million basis points for the year ended december  and million basis points for the year ended december  farmer mac classifies the net interest income and expense realized on financial derivatives that are not in fair value or cash flow hedge relationships as gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets 
for the years ended december   and  this classification resulted in a decrease to the net interest yield of basis points  basis points  and basis point  respectively 
the net interest yields for the years ended december   and included the benefits of yield maintenance payments of basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
yield maintenance payments represent the present value of expected future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition of interest income from the related loans 
because the timing and size of these payments vary greatly  variations should not be considered indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results 
for the years ended december   and  the after tax effects of yield maintenance payments on net income and diluted earnings per share were million or per diluted share  million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share  respectively 
the following table provides information regarding interest earning assets and funding for the years ended december   and the balance of non accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest earning loans presented  though no related income is included in the income figures presented 
therefore  as the balance of non accruing loans increases or decreases  the net interest yield will increase or decrease accordingly 
net interest income and the yield will also fluctuate due to the uncertainty of the timing and size of yield maintenance payments 
the average rate earned on cash and cash equivalents reflects the increase in the level of short term interest rates in and  compared to  and an increase in short term market rates in compared to the increase in the average rate for investments reflects the floating rate nature of most investments acquired and outstanding during the higher average rate on loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities reflects the reset of adjustable rate mortgages to higher rates and the acquisition of new higher yielding loans 
the higher average rate on farmer mac s notes payable due within one year is consistent with general trends in average short term rates during the periods presented 
the upward trend in the average rate on notes payable due after one year reflects the issuance of new debt at higher market rates during average balance income expense average rate average balance income expense average rate average balance income expense average rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents investments loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities total interest earning assets funding notes payable due within one year notes payable due after one year total interest bearing liabilities net non interest bearing funding total funding net interest income yield the following table sets forth information regarding the changes in the components of farmer mac s net interest income for the periods indicated 
for each category  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by old rate and changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume 
combined rate volume variances  the third element of the calculation  are allocated based on their relative size 
the increases in income due to rate reflect the reset of variable rate investments and adjustable rate mortgages to higher rates and the acquisition of new higher yielding investments  loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities  as described above 
the increases in expense reflect the increased cost of short term or floating rate funding due to the increase in short term interest rates

increase decrease due to increase decrease due to rate volume total rate volume total in thousands income from interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents investments loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities total expense from interest bearing liabilities change in net interest income guarantee and commitment fees 
guarantee and commitment fee income  which compensate farmer mac for assuming the credit risk on loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  was million for  compared to million for and million for the decrease in guarantee and commitment fee income reflects a decrease in the average balance of outstanding guarantees and ltspcs 
for  and  respectively  the effects of sfas classified guarantee fees received of million  million and million as interest income  although management considers that amount to have been earned in consideration for the assumption of credit risk 
that portion of the difference or spread between the cost of farmer mac s debt funding for loans and the yield on post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities held on its books compensates for credit risk 
when a post act farmer mac i guaranteed security is sold to a third party  farmer mac continues to receive the guarantee fee component of that spread  which continues to compensate farmer mac for its assumption of credit risk 
the portion of the spread that compensates for interest rate risk would not typically continue to be received by farmer mac if the asset were sold  except to the extent attributable to any retained interest only strip 
gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas requires the change in the fair values of financial derivatives to be reflected in a company s net income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
the net effect of gains and losses on financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and trading assets recorded in farmer mac s consolidated statements of operations was a net loss of million for  a net gain of million for and a net gain of million for on a net after tax basis  those gains and losses  combined with the benefits received from the elimination of the amortization of certain premium payments that resulted from sfas  decreased net income available to common stockholders by million in  increased net income available to common stockholders by million for and increased net income available to common stockholders by million for gains on the sale of real estate owned 
gains on the sale of real estate owned were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
representation and warranty claims income 
during and  farmer mac recovered approximately million and million  respectively  from sellers one of which during was zions first national bank  a related party  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements for breaches of representations and warranties associated with prior sales of agricultural mortgage loans to farmer mac 
during  farmer mac had no representation and warranty claims income 
other income 
other income was million for  compared to million for and million for the increases were the result of increases in late fees received 
expenses 
during  and  farmer mac undertook several initiatives to validate and enhance its risk management practices  internal controls and accounting and financial reporting 
these initiatives are the result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of regulatory considerations  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and fca requirements  as well as the heightened focus on the regulatory environment for gses generally 
the general increases in both compensation and employee benefits and general and administrative expenses from through reflect the costs of those initiatives  particularly staffing increases relative to the internal controls function 
compensation and employee benefits were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses  including legal  independent audit  and consulting fees  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
farmer mac expects all of the above mentioned expenses to continue at approximately the same levels through regulatory fees were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
fca has advised farmer mac that its estimated assessment for is million 
the regulatory assessments from fca for each of the examination periods corresponding approximately with each of the years ended december   and include both their originally estimated assessments and revisions to those estimates that reflect actual costs incurred 
these revisions have resulted in both additional assessments and refunds in the past 
income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in and million in farmer mac s effective tax rates for  and were approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively 
for more information about income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on the repurchase of debt 
during  farmer mac recognized a gain of million on the repurchase of million of its outstanding debt 
during and  farmer mac did not repurchase any of its outstanding debt 
non gaap performance measures 
farmer mac reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in addition to gaap measures  farmer mac presents certain non gaap performance measures 
farmer mac uses the latter measures to develop financial plans  to gauge corporate performance and to set incentive compensation because  in management s view  the non gaap measures more accurately represent farmer mac s economic performance  transaction economics and business trends 
investors and the investment analyst community have previously relied upon similar measures to evaluate farmer mac s historical and future performance 
farmer mac s disclosure of non gaap measures is not intended to replace gaap information but  rather  to supplement it 
farmer mac developed non gaap core earnings to present net income less the after tax effects of sfas core earnings for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the reconciliation of gaap net income available to common stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table reconciliation of gaap net income available to common stockholders to core earnings for the year ended december  in thousands gaap net income available to common stockholders less the effects of sfas unrealized gains losses on financial derivatives and trading assets  net of tax benefit from non amortization of premium payments on financial derivatives  net of tax core earnings effects of sfas farmer mac enters into financial derivative transactions to protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of assets  future cash flows and debt issuance  not for trading or speculative purposes 
farmer mac enters into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the characteristics of its short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer term mortgage and other assets  and also to adjust the characteristics of its long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its short term assets  thereby reducing interest rate risk and also to derive an overall lower effective fixed rate cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available to farmer mac in the conventional debt market 
specifically  interest rate swaps convert economically the variable cash flows related to the forecasted issuance of short term debt to effectively fixed rate medium term and long term notes that match the anticipated duration  repricing and interest rate characteristics of the corresponding assets 
since this strategy provides farmer mac with approximately the same cash flows as those that are inherent in the issuance of medium term notes  farmer mac uses either the bond market or the swap market based upon their relative pricing efficiencies 
farmer mac uses callable interest rate swaps in conjunction with the issuance of short term debt as an alternative to callable medium term notes with equivalently structured maturities and call options 
the call options on the swaps are designed to match the implicit prepayment options on those mortgage assets without prepayment protection 
the blended durations of the swaps are also designed to match the duration of the related mortgages over their estimated lives 
if the mortgages prepay  the swaps can be called and the short term debt repaid  if the mortgages do not prepay  the swaps remain outstanding and the short term debt is rolled over  effectively providing fixed rate callable funding over the lives of the related mortgages 
thus  the economics of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and funding combination 
the callable interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on farmer mac s balance sheet with the related changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
although farmer mac believes that this strategy achieves its economic and risk management objectives  the financial accounting standards board has adopted a mixed attribute accounting model for callable swaps that does not reflect the economics of the transactions 
pursuant to that model  while the issuance of a callable medium term note is recorded at historical cost  the economic equivalent the issuance of short term debt with the forecasted rollover of that debt and the simultaneous issuance of a callable interest rate swap is recorded differently the discount notes are recorded at historical cost and the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value 
despite the closely matched economics and optionality of the assets and the associated interest rate swap and funding combination  the callable swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the test for hedge effectiveness under sfas is based on the linkage between the forecasted short term funding and the callable interest rate swap and ignores the prepayable characteristics of the associated assets being funded

the purchase price for loans purchased from all related parties is determined in the same manner as for loans acquired from any other third party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of related party transactions 
as part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for farmer mac i guaranteed securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying ltspcs  farmer mac purchases defaulted loans  all of which are at least days delinquent at the time of purchase  out of the loan pools underlying those securities and ltspcs 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased out of farmer mac i guaranteed securities is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased under an ltspc is the then current outstanding principal balance of the loan  with accrued and unpaid interest on the defaulted loans payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation proceeds as received 
the purchase price of a defaulted loan is not an indicator of the expected loss on that loan  many other factors affect expected loss  if any  on loans so purchased

farmer mac s decision to retain the remainder of the loans it purchased was based on favorable underlying funding costs that resulted in attractive net interest income over the lives of the loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities it holds 
ltspcs typically involve seasoned loans  while cash purchase transactions usually represent acquisitions of newly originated loans 
compared to prior years  the levels of ltspc activity in and reflected reduced growth rates in the fcs agricultural mortgage business and increased capital within the fcs 
business prospects with fcs institutions have been constrained somewhat by increased fcsic insurance premiums assessed on loans held by those institutions  including loans under ltspcs 
notwithstanding this  management expects that ltspcs will continue to constitute a significant portion of new farmer mac i program activity during new business volume continued to be constrained during factors that constrained farmer mac s new business volume included high levels of available capital and liquidity of agricultural lenders  alternative sources of funding and credit enhancement for agricultural lenders  increased competition in the secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans  reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market  due largely to the strong liquidity of many farmers and ranchers  and the lower rate of growth of the farm credit system mortgage portfolio  reducing the demand for ltspcs 
despite these constraints  farmer mac believes its marketing initiatives are generating business opportunities for and beyond 
initiatives currently under way include an alliance with the american bankers association  entered into in october  under which farmer mac agreed to facilitate access and improve pricing to aba member institutions and the aba agreed to promote member participation in the farmer mac i loan purchase program  new and expanded business relationships that will serve a cross section of agricultural lenders in many areas of the nation  expanded use of agvantage transactions  targeting highly rated financial institutions with large agricultural mortgage portfolios  product enhancements  such as new open prepayment loan structures  agribusiness and rural development loans associated with agriculture  in fulfillment of its congressional mission  federal and state agricultural finance programs  new loan securitization structures  and increased efforts to adjust the pricing of products to reflect with greater precision the risks assumed by farmer mac and the creditworthiness of the obligors on obligations guaranteed by farmer mac 
some of the agribusiness and rural development initiatives will require farmer mac to consider credit risks that expand upon or differ from those the corporation has accepted previously 
farmer mac will use underwriting standards appropriate to those credit risks  and likely will draw upon outside expertise to analyze and evaluate the credit and funding aspects of loans submitted pursuant to those initiatives 
while farmer mac is seeking actively to expand its mix of loan types within the scope of its congressional charter  it is too early to assess the probability of success of these efforts 
farmer mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio transactions similar to those that have accounted for a significant portion of growth in prior years continue to exist  including the previously mentioned january agvantage transaction 
in light of market conditions  however  no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of similar transactions in the future

risk management interest rate risk 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to loans held and on balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities  thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches 
cash flow mismatches in a changing interest rate environment can reduce the earnings of the corporation if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower yielding investments when farmer mac s funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced  or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher cost debt 
yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties contained in many agricultural mortgage loans reduce  but do not eliminate  prepayment risk  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield maintenance may not be collected 
those provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment when they prepay their loans so that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid 
those provisions create a disincentive to prepayment and compensate the corporation for its interest rate risks to a large degree 
as of december   percent of the total outstanding balance of retained farmer mac i loans and guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions and percent had other forms of prepayment protection together covering percent of all loans with fixed interest rates 
of the farmer mac i new and current loans purchased in  percent had yield maintenance or another form of prepayment protection including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates 
as of december   none of the usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions  however  percent contained prepayment penalties 
of the usda guaranteed portions purchased in  percent contained prepayment penalties 
taking into consideration the prepayment provisions and the default probabilities associated with its mortgage assets  farmer mac uses prepayment models to project and value cash flows associated with these assets 
because borrowers behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time  farmer mac periodically evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to actual prepayment experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to improve the precision of subsequent prepayment forecasts 
in addition  farmer mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model development process 
the goal of interest rate risk management at farmer mac is to create and maintain a portfolio that generates stable earnings and value across a variety of interest rate environments 
farmer mac s primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar durations so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change 
to achieve this match  farmer mac issues discount notes and both callable and non callable medium term notes across a spectrum of maturities 
farmer mac issues callable debt to offset the prepayment risk associated with some mortgage assets 
by using a blend of liabilities that includes callable debt  the interest rate sensitivities of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets 
farmer mac also uses financial derivatives to alter the duration of its assets and liabilities to better match their durations  thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity 
farmer mac s million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  matures within three months and is match funded with discount notes having similar maturities 
as of december   million of the billion of investment securities percent were floating rate securities with rates that adjust within one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on investment securities 
these floating rate investments are funded using a series of discount note issuances in which each successive discount note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding repricing date of the related investment  floating rate notes having similar rate reset provisions as the related investment  or fixed rate notes swapped to floating rates having similar reset provisions as the related investment 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans  including loans that farmer mac has committed to acquire other than through ltspcs but has not yet purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase such loans  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loans and the time it either sells farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by the loans  or issues debt to retain the loans in its portfolio although issuing debt to fund the loans as investments does not fully eliminate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans  and any related farmer mac guaranteed securities or debt issuance  through the use of forward sale contracts on the debt and mortgage backed securities of other gses and futures contracts involving us treasury securities 
farmer mac uses forward sale contracts on gse securities to reduce its interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and spreads on farmer mac debt and farmer mac i guaranteed securities 
recognizing that interest rate sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as interest rates change  farmer mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and  if necessary  readjusts its portfolio of assets and liabilities by purchasing mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business  refunding existing liabilities  or using derivatives to alter the characteristics of existing assets or liabilities 
an important stress test of farmer mac s exposure to long term interest rate risk is the measurement of the sensitivity of its market value of equity mve to yield curve shocks 
mve represents the present value of all future cash flows from on and off balance sheet assets  liabilities and financial derivatives  discounted at current interest rates and spreads 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s mve sensitivity analysis as of december  and december  to an immediate and instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve 
percentage change in mve from base case interest rate as of december  scenario bp bp bp bp bp bp n a as of the date indicated  a parallel shift of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve by the number of basis points indicated produced negative interest rates for maturities of years and shorter 
as measured by this mve analysis  farmer mac s long term interest rate sensitivity remained at relatively low levels despite the significant change in the slope of the yield curve that occurred during the year 
farmer mac s effective duration gap was plus months as of december   compared to plus months as of december  as of december   a uniform or parallel increase of basis points would have increased net interest income nii by percent  while a parallel decrease of basis points would have decreased nii by percent 
farmer mac also measures the sensitivity of both mve and nii to a variety of non parallel interest rate shocks  including flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios 
as of december   both mve and nii showed less sensitivity to non parallel shocks as to the parallel shocks 
the relative insensitivity of its mve and nii to both parallel and non parallel interest rate shocks  and its duration gap  indicate that farmer mac s approach to managing its interest rate risk exposures is effective 
the economic effects of financial derivatives  including interest rate swaps  are included in the mve  nii and duration gap analyses 
farmer mac generally enters into various interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk as follows floating to fixed interest rate swaps in which it pays fixed rates of interest to  and receives floating rates of interest from  counterparties  these swaps adjust the characteristics of short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of longer term reset and fixed rate mortgages and other assets and may provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market  fixed to floating interest rate swaps in which it receives fixed rates of interest from  and pays floating rates of interest to  counterparties  these transactions adjust the characteristics of long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of short term or floating rate assets  and basis swaps in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one index to  and receives variable rates of interest based on another index from  counterparties  these swaps alter interest rate indices of liabilities to match those of assets  and vice versa 
as of december   farmer mac had billion combined notional amount of interest rate swaps  with terms ranging from one to fifteen years  of which million were floating to fixed interest rate swaps  million were basis swaps and million were fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
farmer mac uses financial derivatives as an end user for hedging purposes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
when financial derivatives meet the specific hedge criteria under sfas  they are accounted for as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges 
financial derivatives that do not satisfy those hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
all of farmer mac s financial derivative transactions are conducted under standard collateralized agreements that limit farmer mac s potential credit exposure to any counterparty 
as of december   farmer mac had uncollateralized net exposures of million to two counterparties 
credit risk loans 
farmer mac s primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages in conjunction with a deficiency in the value of the collateral relative to the amount outstanding on the mortgage and the cost of liquidation 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on loans it holds  loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities  and loans underlying ltspcs 
loans held or loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs can be divided into four groups loans held for investment  loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs  and usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
for loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  ten percent first loss subordinated interests mitigate farmer mac s credit risk exposure 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac generally assumes percent of the credit risk on loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac s credit exposure on usda guaranteed portions is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities because of the subordinated interests  or to usda guaranteed portions because of the usda guarantee 
the outstanding principal balances of loans held  loans underlying ltspcs and farmer mac guaranteed securities  and real estate owned are summarized in the following table 
as of december  in thousands farmer mac i post act pre act farmer mac ii usda guaranteed portions farmer mac conducts guarantee fee adequacy analyses  using stress test models developed internally and with the assistance of outside experts 
these analyses have taken into account the diverse and dissimilar characteristics of the various asset categories for which farmer mac manages its risk exposures  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new asset categories 
based on current information  farmer mac believes that its guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes 
farmer mac has established underwriting  appraisal and documentation standards for agricultural mortgage loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults and to provide guidance concerning the management  administration and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all participating sellers and potential sellers in its programs 
these standards were developed on the basis of industry norms for agricultural mortgage loans and are designed to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
farmer mac requires sellers to make representations and warranties regarding the conformity of eligible mortgage loans to these standards  the accuracy of loan data provided to farmer mac and other requirements related to the loans 
sellers are responsible to farmer mac for breaches of those representations and warranties that result in economic losses to the corporation 
pursuant to contracts with farmer mac and in consideration servicing fees  farmer mac approved central servicers service loans in accordance with farmer mac requirements 
central servicers are responsible to farmer mac for serious errors in the servicing of those mortgage loans 
detailed information regarding farmer mac s underwriting and appraisal standards and seller eligibility requirements are presented in business farmer mac programs farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards and business farmer mac programs farmer mac i sellers 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended sfas 
for accepting the credit risk on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  farmer mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees  respectively 
for loans held  farmer mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to its guarantee fee  which farmer mac views as compensation for assuming credit risk 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
as of december   farmer mac had experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is presented in three components on its consolidated balance sheet an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned  and an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
farmer mac s provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated statement of operations a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
historically  farmer mac estimated probable losses using a systematic process that began with management s evaluation of the results of a proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model 
that model drew upon historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans screened to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those eligible for farmer mac s programs 
the results generated by that model were then modified  as necessary  by the application of management s judgment 
during third quarter  farmer mac completed the planned migration of its methodology for determining its allowance for losses away from one based on its loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model to one based on its own historical portfolio loss experience and credit trends 
farmer mac recorded the effects of that change as a change in accounting estimate as of september  farmer mac s new methodology for determining its allowance for losses incorporates the corporation s proprietary automated loan classification system 
that system scores loans based on criteria such as historical repayment performance  loan seasoning  loan size and ltv 
for the purposes of the loss allowance methodology  the loans in farmer mac s portfolio of loans and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs have been scored and classified for each calendar quarter since first quarter the new allowance methodology captures the migration of loan scores across concurrent and overlapping year time horizons and calculates loss rates separately within each loan classification for loans underlying ltspcs and loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities 
the calculated loss rates are applied to the current classification distribution of farmer mac s portfolio to estimate inherent losses  on the assumption that the historical credit losses and trends used to calculate loss rates will continue in the future 
management evaluates this assumption by taking into consideration several factors  including economic conditions  geographic and agricultural commodity product concentrations in the portfolio  the credit profile of the portfolio  delinquency trends of the portfolio  and historical charge off and recovery activities of the portfolio 
if  based on that evaluation  management concludes that the assumption is not valid  the loss allowance calculation is modified by the addition of further assumptions to capture current portfolio trends and characteristics that differ from historical experience 
farmer mac also analyzes impaired assets in its portfolio for impairment under sfas farmer mac s impaired assets include non performing assets loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned  loans for which farmer mac had adjusted the timing of borrowers payment schedules  but still expects to collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions  and additional performing loans that have previously been delinquent or are secured by real estate that produces agricultural commodities or products currently under stress 
for loans with an updated appraised value  other updated collateral valuation or management s estimate of discounted collateral value  this analysis includes the measurement of the fair value of the underlying collateral for individual loans relative to the total recorded investment  including principal  interest and advances 
in the event that the collateral value does not support the total recorded investment  farmer mac specifically allocates an allowance for the loan for the difference between the recorded investment and its fair value  less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral 
for the remaining impaired assets without updated valuations  this analysis is performed in the aggregate in consideration of the similar risk characteristics of the assets and historical statistics 
management believes that its use of this methodology produces a reliable estimate of inherent probable losses  as of the balance sheet date  for all loans held  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs in accordance with sfas and sfas the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses charged to operating expense and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries 
negative provisions for loan losses or negative provisions for losses are recorded in the event that the estimate of probable losses as of the end of a period is lower than the estimate at the beginning of the period 
the establishment of and periodic adjustments to the valuation allowance for real estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds

additionally  farmer mac recorded gains on the sale of real estate owned in and of million and million  respectively 
as of december   farmer mac s allowance for losses totaled million  or basis points of the outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million basis points as of december  the year to year decrease in this ratio is a result of the overall improved credit quality of the farmer mac portfolio  the strong us agricultural economy  and the recordation of a change in accounting estimate resulting from the implementation  during third quarter  of a new methodology to estimate probable losses inherent in its post act farmer mac i portfolio 
as of december   farmer mac s day delinquencies totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  from quarter to quarter  farmer mac anticipates the day delinquencies will fluctuate  both in dollars and as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters of each year corresponding to the semi annual january st and july st payment characteristics of most farmer mac i loans 
as of december   loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned post act non performing assets totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  loans that have been restructured after delinquency were insignificant and are included within the reported day delinquency and non performing asset disclosures

farmer mac evaluated the remaining million of impaired assets for which updated valuations were not available in the aggregate in consideration of their similar risk characteristics and historical statistics 
of the million of assets analyzed  million were adequately collateralized 
for the million of assets that were not adequately collateralized  individual collateral shortfalls totaled million 
accordingly  farmer mac recorded specific allowances of million for those under collateralized assets as of december  as of december   in addition to the specific allowances provided  farmer mac recorded non specific or general allowances of million  bringing the total allowance for losses to million 
original ltvs calculated by dividing the loan principal balance at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment by the appraised value at the date of loan origination or  when available  updated appraised value at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment are one of many factors farmer mac considers in evaluating loss severity 
other factors include  but are not limited to  other underwriting standards  commodity and farming forecasts and regional economic and agricultural conditions 
loans in the farmer mac i program are all first mortgage agricultural real estate loans 
accordingly  farmer mac s exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued interest  advances and the principal balance of a loan and the value of the property 
measurement of that excess or shortfall is the best predictor and determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a particular farm operator 
ltvs depend upon the market value of a property with due regard for its income producing potential in the hands of a competent operator 
as required by farmer mac s collateral valuation standards  an appraisal of agricultural real estate must include analysis of the income producing capability of the property and address the income estimate in the market analysis 
debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage  which can vary widely within a geographic region  commodity type  or an operator s business and farming skills 
as of december   the weighted average original ltv for post act loans and loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs was percent  and the weighted average original ltv for all post act non performing assets was percent

several of the loans underlying agricultural storage and processing ltspcs are for facilities under construction  and as of december   approximately million of the loans were not yet disbursed by the lender 
an analysis of farmer mac s historical losses and identified specific collateral deficiencies within the portfolio by origination year indicates that farmer mac has experienced peak loss years as loans have aged between approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination  regardless of the year the loans were added to farmer mac s portfolio 
while farmer mac expects that there will be loans that have aged past their fifth year that will become delinquent and possibly default  farmer mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans due to the combination of principal amortization and collateral value appreciation 
analysis of portfolio performance by commodity distribution indicates that losses and collateral deficiencies have been and are expected to remain less prevalent in the loans secured by real estate producing agricultural commodities that receive significant government support such as cotton  soybeans  wheat and corn and more prevalent in those that do not receive such support 
this analysis is consistent with corresponding commodity analysis  which indicates that farmer mac has experienced higher loss and collateral deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent plantings 
most of the loans classified as permanent plantings do not receive significant government support and are therefore more susceptible to adverse commodity specific economic trends 
further  as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular commodity that requires a long term improvement on the land  such as permanent plantings  the prospective sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related loans may become under collateralized 
farmer mac anticipates that one or more particular commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and actively manages its portfolio to mitigate concentration risks while preserving farmer mac s ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups 
analysis of portfolio performance by geographic distribution indicates that  while commodities are the primary determinant of exposure to loss  within most commodity groups certain geographic areas allow greater economies of scale or proximity to markets than others and  consequently  result in more successful farms within the commodity group 
likewise  certain geographic areas offer better growing conditions than others and  consequently  result in more versatile and more successful farms within a given commodity group and the ability to switch crops among commodity groups 
farmer mac s methodologies for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees  managing credit risks and providing adequate allowances for losses consider all of the foregoing factors and information 
credit risk institutional 
farmer mac is also exposed to credit risk arising from its business relationships with other institutions including issuers of agvantage securities and other investments held or guaranteed by farmer mac  sellers and servicers  and interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage securities are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from percent to percent of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage securities by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the issuers of the agvantage securities 
outstanding agvantage securities totaled million as of december   and million as of december  in addition  on january   as noted above  farmer mac guaranteed million principal amount of agvantage securities 
farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring those institutions to meet farmer mac s standards for creditworthiness 
farmer mac monitors the financial condition of those institutions by evaluating financial statements and bank credit rating agency reports 
for more information on farmer mac s approval of sellers  see business farmer mac programs farmer mac i sellers 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in risk management interest rate risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk other investments 
the credit risk inherent in other investments held by farmer mac is mitigated by farmer mac s policies of investing in highly rated instruments and establishing concentration limits  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty

farmer mac s board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to billion of discount notes and medium term notes of which billion was outstanding as of december   subject to periodic review of the adequacy of that level relative to farmer mac s borrowing requirements 
farmer mac invests the proceeds of such issuances in loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities  mission related assets and non program investment assets in accordance with policies established by its board of directors 
liquidity 
the funding and liquidity needs of farmer mac s business programs are driven by the purchase and retention of loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities  the maturities of farmer mac s discount notes and medium term notes and payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are principal and interest payments and ongoing guarantee and commitment fees received on loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  principal and interest payments received from investment securities  and the issuance of new discount notes and medium term notes 
farmer mac projects its expected cash flows from loans and securities  other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its obligations to retire debt and pay other liabilities as they come due 
farmer mac issues discount notes and medium term notes to meet the needs associated with its business operations  including liquidity  and also to increase its presence in the capital markets in order to reduce the rates it pays on its debt  which allows farmer mac to accept lower rates on mortgages to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners that it purchases from lenders 
during  the corporation continued its strategy of using its non program investment portfolio referred to as farmer mac s liquidity portfolio to facilitate increasing its ongoing presence in the capital markets 
to meet investor demand for daily presence in the capital markets  farmer mac issues discount notes in maturities principally ranging from one day to approximately ninety days and invests the proceeds not needed for program asset purchases in highly rated securities 
investments are predominantly short term money market securities with maturities closely matched to the discount note maturities and floating rate securities with reset terms of less than one year and closely matched to the maturity of the discount notes 
the positive spread earned from these investments enhances the net interest income farmer mac earns  thereby improving the net yields at which farmer mac can purchase mortgages from lenders who may pass that benefit to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners through the farmer mac programs

as a result of farmer mac s regular issuance of discount notes and medium term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the united states  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
farmer mac has also used floating to fixed interest rate swaps  combined with discount note issuances  as a source of fixed rate funding 
while the swap market may provide favorable fixed rates  swap transactions expose farmer mac to the risk of future widening of its own issuance spreads versus corresponding libor rates 
if the spreads on the farmer mac discount notes were to increase relative to libor  farmer mac would be exposed to a commensurate reduction on its net interest yield on the notional amount of its floating to fixed interest rate swaps and other libor based floating rate assets

for a discussion of risk based capital  see business government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards general 
certain enforcement powers are given to fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards

furthermore  farmer mac could sell billion of on balance sheet non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investment securities and billion of on balance sheet program assets in order to support further increases of on and off balance sheet program guarantees and commitments 
any transactions would be evaluated for compliance with risk based capital requirements and to optimize farmer mac s return on equity and capital flexibility

the table does not include amounts due under agreements that are cancelable without penalty or further payment as of december  and therefore do not represent enforceable and legally binding obligations 
the table also does not include amounts due under the terms of employment agreements with members of senior management  nor does it include payments that are based on a varying outstanding loan volume such as servicing fees  as those payments are not known fixed and determinable contractual obligations

the fair values of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
because the financial derivative liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the financial derivative contracts  those liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further information regarding financial derivatives is included in note h and note to the consolidated financial statements

regulatory matters regulatory actions continue to affect farmer mac s business outlook 
on september   the final regulation relating to farmer mac s investments and liquidity became effective 
fca included several of the revisions to the proposed regulation suggested by farmer mac in comments to the proposal and farmer mac expects to be able to comply with the regulation in accordance with the timeframes established in the regulation 
farmer mac is required to comply with the liquidity provisions of the regulation by september  in the november  issue of the federal register  fca published for public comment a proposed rule that would revise certain fca regulations governing the risk based capital test applicable to farmer mac 
the public comment period for that proposed rule will close april  fca s announcement of the proposed rule stated that it is designed to update farmer mac s risk based capital stress test to reflect the evolution of the corporation s loan portfolio and the practices of other leading financial institutions 
the fca board is currently scheduled to consider a final rule for the farmer mac risk based capital stress test in september farmer mac has not completed its analysis of the proposed rule  but believes that the proposal  if adopted in its proposed form and under current economic conditions and the state of the corporation s portfolio  would increase the corporation s risk based capital requirement from the current level to a higher level that would be close to the statutory minimum capital requirement 
in that regard  fca has estimated that  had the proposed rule been effective at the time  the risk based capital requirement as of june  would have been million  compared to the million risk based capital requirement under the current risk based capital stress test 
as of that date  farmer mac s regulatory capital was million 
as part of the formal rule making process  farmer mac will provide written comments on the proposed regulation to fca within the public comment period 
other matters new accounting standards 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop no 
to address accounting for differences between the contractual cash flows of certain loans and debt securities and the cash flows expected to be collected when loans or debt securities are acquired in a transfer and those cash flow differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop no 
requires that the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected not be recognized as an adjustment of yield or valuation allowance  such as the allowance for losses 
subsequent to the initial investment  increases in expected cash flows generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loan or debt security over its remaining life 
decreases in expected cash flows should be recognized as impairment 
sop no 
is effective for loans and debt securities acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop no 
in did not have a material effect farmer mac s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf amended eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment 
this amendment  which was originally effective for financial periods beginning after june   introduced qualitative and quantitative guidance for determining whether securities are other than temporarily impaired 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position no 
and no 
fsp  which nullifies the guidance in paragraphs of eitf  and references existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
the fsp clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell the security has not been made  and also provides guidance on the subsequent accounting for impaired debt securities 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of the fsp is not expected to have a material effect on farmer mac s results of operations or financial position 
in december  fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
currently  as discussed in note m  farmer mac accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee stock options pursuant to apb and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas sfas r eliminates the alternative to use apb s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
farmer mac will adopt sfas r as of january  farmer mac will follow the modified prospective method for the application of sfas r  which requires the recordation of compensation expense for the non vested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding as of the initial date of adoption and any awards issued or modified after january  see note m for farmer mac s estimate of compensation expense that will be recorded in future fiscal years related to previously issued awards outstanding as of the initial date of adoption 
because farmer mac recognized no compensation cost for equity based awards prior to the adoption of sfas r  farmer mac expects that sfas r will have a significant effect on farmer mac s results of operations  although the net effects on farmer mac s overall financial position and cash flows will be insignificant 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless determination of either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change is impracticable or otherwise promulgated 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas  upon adoption  is not expected to have a material effect on farmer mac s results of operations or financial position 
in february  fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas  which resolves issues addressed in statement implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
sfas  among other things  permits the fair value re measurement of any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of statement  and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued in a fiscal year beginning after september  sfas is not expected to have a material effect on farmer mac s results of operations and financial position
