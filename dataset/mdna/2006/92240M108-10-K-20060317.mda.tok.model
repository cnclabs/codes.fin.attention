item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we are a holding company for a number of businesses 
we are engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states through our subsidiary liggett group inc  the development and marketing of the low nicotine and nicotine free quest cigarette products and the development of reduced risk cigarette products through our subsidiary vector tobacco inc  and the real estate business through our subsidiary  new valley llc  which is seeking to acquire additional operating companies and real estate properties 
new valley owns of douglas elliman realty  llc  which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
in recent years  we have undertaken a number of initiatives to streamline the cost structure of our tobacco business and improve operating efficiency and long term earnings 
during  the sales and marketing functions  along with certain support functions  of our liggett and vector tobacco subsidiaries were combined into a new entity  liggett vector brands inc this company coordinates and executes the sales and marketing efforts for our tobacco operations 
effective year end  we closed vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing facility in order to reduce excess cigarette production capacity and improve operating efficiencies company wide 
production of quest and vector tobacco s other cigarette brands was transferred to liggett s state of the art manufacturing facility in mebane  north carolina 
in july  we completed the sale of the timberlake facility and equipment 
in april  we eliminated a number of positions in our tobacco operations and subleased excess office space 
in october  we announced a plan to restructure the operations of liggett vector brands 
liggett vector brands has realigned its sales force and adjusted its business model to more efficiently serve its chain and independent customers nationwide 
in connection with the restructuring  we eliminated approximately full time positions and part time positions as of december  we may consider various additional opportunities to further improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
these prior and current initiatives have involved material restructuring and impairment charges  and any further actions taken are likely to involve material charges as well 
although management may estimate that substantial cost savings will be associated with these restructuring actions  there is a risk that these actions could have a serious negative impact on our tobacco operations and that any estimated increases in profitability cannot be achieved 
in december  we completed an exchange offer and a subsequent short form merger whereby we acquired the remaining of the common shares of new valley that we did not already own 
as a result of these transactions  new valley became our wholly owned subsidiary and each outstanding new valley common share was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
a total of approximately million of our common shares were issued to the new valley shareholders in the transactions 
all of liggett s unit sales volume in and was in the discount segment  which liggett s management believes has been the primary growth segment in the industry for over a decade 
the significant discounting of premium cigarettes in recent years has led to brands  such as eve  that were traditionally considered premium brands to become more appropriately categorized as discount  following list price reductions 
effective february   liggett reduced the eve list price from the premium price level to the branded discount level 

table of contents liggett s cigarettes are produced in approximately combinations of length  style and packaging 
liggett s current brand portfolio includes liggett select the third largest brand in the deep discount category  grand prix the fastest growing brand in the deep discount segment  eve a leading brand of millimeter cigarettes in the branded discount category  pyramid the industry s first deep discount product with a brand identity  and usa and various partner brands and private label brands 
in  liggett introduced liggett select  one of the leading brands in the deep discount category 
liggett select is now the largest seller in liggett s family of brands  comprising of liggett s unit volume in  in and in in september  liggett repositioned grand prix to distributors and retailers nationwide 
grand prix is marketed as the lowest price fighter to specifically compete with brands which are priced at the lowest level of the deep discount segment 
we believe that liggett has gained a sustainable cost advantage over its competitors through its various settlement agreements 
under the master settlement agreement reached in november with states and various territories  the three largest cigarette manufacturers must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually 
liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  as a result of the medallion acquisition  vector tobacco likewise has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
the discount segment is highly competitive  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
while the three major manufacturers all compete with liggett in the discount segment of the market  the strongest competition for market share has recently come from a group of small manufacturers and importers  most of which sell low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
in january  vector tobacco introduced quest  its brand of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
quest is designed for adult smokers who are interested in reducing their levels of nicotine intake and is available in both menthol and non menthol styles 
each quest style regular and menthol offers three different packagings  with decreasing amounts of nicotine quest  and quest  the low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the extra low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the nicotine free variety  contains only trace levels of nicotine no more than milligrams of nicotine per cigarette 
quest cigarettes utilize proprietary  patented and patent pending processes and materials that enables the production of cigarettes with nicotine free tobacco that tastes and smokes like tobacco in conventional cigarettes 
all six quest varieties are being sold in box style packs and are priced comparably to other premium brands 
quest was initially available in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  ohio  indiana  illinois and michigan 
these seven states account for approximately of all cigarette sales in the united states 
a multi million dollar advertising and marketing campaign  with advertisements running in magazines and regional newspapers  supported the product launch 
the brand continues to be supported by point of purchase awareness campaigns 
the premium segment of the industry continues to experience intense competitive activity  with significant discounting of premium brands at all levels of retail 
given these marketplace conditions  and the results that we have seen to date with quest  we have taken a measured approach to expanding the market presence of the brand 
in november  vector tobacco introduced three menthol varieties of quest in the seven state market 
in january  quest and quest menthol were introduced into an expansion market in arizona  which accounts for approximately of the industry volume nationwide 
during the second quarter  based on an analysis of the market data obtained since the introduction of the quest product  we determined to postpone indefinitely the national launch of quest 
any determination as to future expansion of the market presence of quest will be based on the ongoing and 
table of contents projected demand for the product  market conditions in the premium segment and the prevailing regulatory environment  including any restrictions on the advertising of the product 
during the second quarter  we recognized a non cash charge of  to adjust the carrying value of excess leaf tobacco inventory for the quest product  based on estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand for the product or market conditions are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
quest brand cigarettes are currently marketed solely to permit adult smokers  who wish to continue smoking  to gradually reduce their intake of nicotine 
the products are not labeled or advertised for smoking cessation or as a safer form of smoking 
in october  we announced that jed e 
rose  phd  director of duke university medical center s nicotine research program and co inventor of the nicotine patch  had conducted a study at duke university medical center to provide preliminary evaluation of the use of the quest technology as a smoking cessation aid 
in the preliminary study on quest  of quest smokers were able to achieve four week continuous abstinence  a standard threshold for smoking cessation 
management believes these results show real promise for the quest technology as a smoking cessation aid 
we have received guidance from the food and drug administration as to the additional clinical research and regulatory filings necessary to market quest as a smoking cessation product 
we are currently conducting a multi centered clinical trial with quest cigarettes  which should be completed by the end of the first quarter of management believes that obtaining the food and drug administration s approval to market quest as a smoking cessation product will be an important factor in the long term commercial success of the quest brand 
no assurance can be given that such approval can be obtained or as to the timing of any such approval if received 
recent developments new valley exchange offer

tobacco quota elimination 
in october  federal legislation was enacted which abolished the federal tobacco quota and price support program 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products will be assessed  over a ten year period to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
cigarette manufacturers will initially be responsible for of the assessment subject to adjustment in the future  which will be allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
management currently estimates that liggett s assessment will be approximately  for the first year of the program which began january   including a special federal quota stock liquidation assessment of  the cost of the legislation to the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers  including liggett and vector tobacco  because one 
table of contents effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers will no longer be obligated to make certain contractual payments  commonly known as phase ii payments  they agreed in to make to tobacco producing states 
the ultimate impact of this legislation cannot be determined  but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers  such as liggett and vector tobacco  will be disproportionately affected by the legislation  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
effective october   liggett increased the list price of all its brands by 
per carton 
the increase was taken due to the federal tobacco buyout legislation 
liggett vector brands restructurings 
liggett vector brands  as part of the continuing effort to adjust the cost structure of our tobacco business and improve operating efficiency  eliminated positions during april  sublet its new york office space and relocated several employees

liggett vector brands has realigned its sales force and adjusted its business model to more efficiently serve its chain and independent accounts nationwide 
in connection with the restructuring  we eliminated approximately full time positions and part time positions as of december  as a result of the actions announced in october  we realized annual cost savings of approximately  beginning in expenses at liggett  excluding the accrual for disputed settlement payments in and product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs  were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  primarily attributable to the restructuring announced in october we recognized pre tax restructuring charges of  in  with  of the charges related to employee severance and benefit costs and  to contract termination and other associated costs 
approximately  of these charges represented non cash items 
additionally  we incurred other charges in for various compensation and related payments to employees which were related to the restructuring 
these charges of  were included in operating  selling  administrative and general expenses 
timberlake restructuring 
in october  we announced that we would close vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing facility in order to reduce excess cigarette production capacity and improve operating efficiencies company wide 
production of the quest line of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarettes  as well as production of vector tobacco s other cigarette brands  was moved to liggett s state of the art manufacturing facility in mebane  north carolina 
as a result of these actions  we recognized pre tax restructuring and impairment charges of  of which  was recognized in and the remaining was recognized in machinery and equipment to be disposed of was reduced to estimated fair value less costs to sell during we decreased the asset impairment accrual as of june  to reflect the actual amounts realized from the sale of the timberlake facility and to reduce the values of other excess vector tobacco machinery and equipment in accordance with sfas no 
we further adjusted the previously recorded restructuring accrual as of june  to reflect additional employee severance and benefits  contract termination and associated costs resulting from the timberlake sale 
no charge to operations resulted from these adjustments as there was no change to the total impairment and restructuring charges previously recognized 
annual cost savings related to the timberlake restructuring and impairment charges and the actions taken at liggett vector brands in the first half of were estimated to be at least  beginning in management believes the anticipated annual cost savings have been achieved beginning in management will continue to review opportunities for additional cost savings in our tobacco business 
tax matters 
in connection with the and transaction with philip morris incorporated in which a subsidiary of liggett contributed three of its premium cigarette brands to trademarks llc  a newly formed limited liability company  we recognized in a pre tax gain of  in our consolidated 
table of contents financial statements and established a deferred tax liability of  relating to the gain 
in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest for a day period commencing in march upon exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march  we will be required to pay tax in the amount of the deferred tax liability  which will be offset by the benefit of any deferred tax assets  including any net operating losses  available to us at that time 
in connection with an examination of our and federal income tax returns  the internal revenue service issued to us in september a notice of proposed adjustment 
the notice asserts that  for tax reporting purposes  the entire gain should have been recognized in and in in the additional amounts of  and  respectively  rather than upon the exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march if the internal revenue service were to ultimately prevail with the proposed adjustment  it would result in the potential acceleration of tax payments of approximately  including interest  net of tax benefits  through december  these amounts have been previously recognized in our consolidated financial statements as tax liabilities 
as of december   we believe amounts potentially due have been fully provided for in our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe the positions reflected on our income tax returns are correct and intend to vigorously oppose any proposed adjustments to our returns 
we have filed a protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service 
no payment is due with respect to these matters during the appeals process 
interest currently is accruing on the disputed amounts at a rate of  with the rate adjusted quarterly based on rates published by the us treasury department 
if taxing authorities were to ultimately prevail in their assertion that we incurred a tax obligation prior to the exercise dates of these options and we were required to make such tax payments prior to or  and if any necessary financing were not available to us  our liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
tobacco settlement agreements 
in october  liggett was notified that all participating manufacturers payment obligations under the master settlement agreement  dating from the agreement s execution in late  have been recalculated utilizing net unit amounts  rather than gross unit amounts which have been utilized since 
the change in the method of calculation could  among other things  require additional payments by liggett under the master settlement agreement of approximately  for the periods through  and require liggett to pay an additional amount of approximately  in and in future periods by lowering liggett s market share exemption under the master settlement agreement 
liggett contends that the retroactive change from utilizing gross unit amounts to net unit amounts is impermissible and has objected to the change 
liggett has disputed the change in methodology 
no amounts have been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross versus net dispute 
on march   the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement calculated  in master settlement agreement payments for liggett s sales 
on april   liggett paid  of this amount and  in accordance with its rights under the master settlement agreement  disputed the balance of  of the disputed amount  liggett paid  into the disputed payments account under the master settlement agreement and withheld from payment  the  paid into the disputed payments account represents the amount claimed by liggett as an adjustment to its payment obligation under the master settlement agreement for market share loss to non participating manufacturers 
at december   included in other current assets on our balance sheet was a receivable of  relating to such amount 
the  withheld from payment represents  claimed as an adjustment to liggett s master settlement agreement obligation for market share loss to non participating manufacturers and  relating to the retroactive change  discussed above  to the method for computing payment obligations under the master settlement agreement which liggett contends  among other things  is not in accordance with the master settlement agreement 
on may   new york state filed a motion on behalf of the settling states in new york state court seeking to compel liggett and the other subsequent participating manufacturers that paid into the disputed payments account to release to the settling states the amounts paid into such account 
the settling states contend that liggett had no right under the master 
table of contents settlement agreement and related agreements to pay into the disputed payments account any amount claimed as an adjustment for market share loss to non participating manufacturers for  although they acknowledge that liggett has the right to dispute such amounts 
by stipulation among the parties dated july   new york s motion was dismissed and liggett authorized the release to the settling states of the  it had paid into the account  although liggett continues to dispute that it owes this amount 
liggett intends to withhold from its payment due under the master settlement agreement on april  approximately  which liggett claims as the non participating manufacturers adjustment to its payment obligation 
as of december   liggett and vector tobacco have disputed the following assessments under the master settlement agreement related to failure to receive credit for market share loss to non participating manufacturers  for   for and approximately for these disputed amounts have not been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in  the attorneys general for each of florida  mississippi and texas advised liggett that they believed that liggett has failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period through and that additional payments may be due for and subsequent years 
liggett believes these allegations are without merit  based  among other things  on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements 
in december  the state of florida offered to settle all amounts allegedly owed by liggett for the period through for the sum of  in march  the state of florida reaffirmed its december offer to settle and provided liggett with a day notice to cure the alleged defaults

table of contents recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately individual suits  purported class actions and eight governmental and other third party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the united states in which liggett was a named defendant 
a civil lawsuit was filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately  from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
a federal appellate court ruled in february that disgorgement is not an available remedy in the case 
in october  the united states supreme court declined to review this decision 
trial of the case concluded on june  on june   the government sought to restructure its potential remedies and filed a proposed final judgment and order 
that relief can be grouped into four categories  for a cessation and counter marketing program  so called corrective statements  disclosures  and enjoined activities 
post trial briefing was completed in october in one of the other cases pending against liggett  in  an action against cigarette manufacturers involving approximately  named individual plaintiffs was consolidated for trial on some common related issues before a single west virginia state court 
liggett is a defendant in most of the cases pending in west virginia 
in january  the court severed liggett from the trial of the consolidated action 
two purported class actions have been certified in state court in kansas and new mexico against the cigarette manufacturers for alleged antitrust violations 
as new cases are commenced  the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase 
there are five individual smoking related actions where liggett is the only tobacco company defendant 
in april  in one of these cases  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of against liggett 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of liggett has appealed the verdict 
in march  in another case in florida state court where liggett is the only defendant  the court granted liggett s motion for summary judgment disposing of the case in its entirety 
the plaintiff has appealed 
in march  in another of these cases  a florida state court jury returned a verdict in favor of liggett 
the plaintiff may appeal 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a  punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle smoking and health class action 
in may  the florida supreme court agreed to review the case  and oral argument was held in november if the intermediate appellate court s ruling is not upheld on appeal  it will have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  liggett filed the  bond required under the bonding statute enacted in by the florida legislature which limits the size of any bond required  pending appeal  to stay execution of a punitive damages verdict 
in may  liggett reached an agreement with the class in the engle case  which provided assurance to liggett that the stay of execution  in effect under the florida bonding statute  would not be lifted or limited at any point until completion of all appeals  including to the united states supreme court 
as required by the agreement  liggett paid  into an escrow account to be held for the benefit of the engle class  and released  along with liggett s existing  statutory bond  to the court for the benefit of the class upon completion of the appeals process  regardless of the outcome of the appeal 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the verdict  which is subject to the outcome of the engle appeal  has been overturned as a result of the appellate court s ruling discussed above 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
federal or state regulators may object to vector tobacco s low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products and reduced risk cigarette products it may develop as unlawful or allege they bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims  and seek the removal of the products from the marketplace  or significant changes to advertising 
various concerns regarding vector tobacco s advertising practices have been 
table of contents expressed to vector tobacco by certain state attorneys general 
vector tobacco has engaged in discussions in an effort to resolve these concerns and vector tobacco has  in the interim  suspended all print advertising for its quest brand 
if vector tobacco is unable to advertise its quest brand  it could have a material adverse effect on sales of quest 
allegations by federal or state regulators  public health organizations and other tobacco manufacturers that vector tobacco s products are unlawful  or that its public statements or advertising contain misleading or unsubstantiated health claims or product comparisons  may result in litigation or governmental proceedings 
in recent years  there have been a number of proposed restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the food and drug administration 
there have also been adverse political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry  including the commencement and certification of class actions and the commencement of third party payor actions 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any smoking related litigation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of legislation  regulation and litigation 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include restructuring and impairment charges  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans  embedded derivative liability  the tobacco quota buyout  settlement accruals and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of any related inventory cost recoveries 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely effected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as a reduction in revenue in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we have recorded charges related to employee severance and benefits  asset impairments  contract termination and other associated exit costs during and the calculation of severance pay requires management to identify employees to be terminated and the timing of their severance from employment 
the calculation of benefits charges requires actuarial assumptions including determination of discount rates 
as discussed further below  the asset impairments were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires management to estimate the fair value of assets to be disposed of 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
charges related to restructuring activities initiated after this date were recorded when incurred 
prior to this date  charges were recorded at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan in accordance with eitf  liability 
table of contents recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these restructuring charges are based on management s best estimate at the time of restructuring 
the status of the restructuring activities is reviewed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the reserve  which could differ materially from previous estimates  are recorded as an adjustment to operating income 
purchase accounting 
we account for business combination transactions  including the exchange offer and merger with new valley  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that we allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
estimates of fair values for the non consolidated real estate businesses of new valley are generally based on independent appraisals and other accounts are based on management s best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment  including developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for the non consolidated real estate businesses 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be fully recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances include a significant adverse charge in the manner in which a long lived asset  or group of assets  is being used or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset  or group of assets  will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
the estimate of fair value of our long lived assets is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets and the results of using other valuation techniques 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
in october  we announced that we would close vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing facility and produce its cigarette products at liggett s mebane  north carolina facility 
we evaluated the net realizable value of the long lived assets located at the timberlake facility which has been sold 
based on management s estimates of the values  we initially recognized non cash asset impairment charges of  in the third quarter of on machinery and equipment 
as of june   we decreased the asset impairment accrual to reflect the actual amounts realized from the timberlake sale and to reduce values of other excess machinery and equipment in accordance with sfas no 
contingencies 
we record liggett s product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and above under the heading recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate with respect to the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending smoking related litigation or the costs of defending such cases  and we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
you should not infer from the absence of any such reserve in our financial statements that liggett will not be subject to significant tobacco related liabilities in the future 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such smoking related litigation 
settlement agreements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  liggett and vector tobacco are participants in the master settlement agreement  the agreement to settle governmental healthcare cost recovery actions brought by various states 
liggett and vector tobacco have no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately and  respectively  of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
their obligations  and the related expense charges under the master settlement agreement  are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by liggett and vector tobacco  their relative market shares and inflation 
since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the master settlement agreement is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products 
table of contents are shipped 
settlement expenses under the master settlement agreement recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were  for   for and  for adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
derivatives  beneficial conversion feature 
we measure all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  at fair value and recognize them in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on our rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in november  we issued in a private placement variable interest senior convertible notes due where a portion of the total interest payable on the notes is computed by reference to the cash dividends paid on our common stock 
in december and during the first half of  we issued additional notes on the same terms 
this portion of the interest payment is considered an embedded derivative 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  we have bifurcated this dividend portion of the interest on the notes and  based on a valuation by an independent third party  estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability 
at the initial issuance of the notes in november  the estimated initial fair value of the embedded derivative liability was  which was recorded as a discount to the notes and classified as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   with the issuance of  of additional notes  the derivative liability was estimated at  changes to the fair value of this embedded derivative are reflected quarterly as an adjustment to interest expense 
we recognized a gain of  in and a loss of in  due to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative  which were reported as adjustments to interest expense 
after giving effect to the recording of the embedded derivative liability as a discount to the notes  our common stock had a fair value at the issuance date of the notes in excess of the conversion price resulting in a beneficial conversion feature 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable convertible ratios  requires that the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature  at december  be recorded to additional paid in capital and as a discount on the notes 
the discount is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest rate method 
we recognized non cash interest expense of  in and in  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and the first in  first out fifo method at vector tobacco 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
at december   approximately  of our leaf inventory was associated with vector tobacco s quest product 
during the second quarter of  we recognized a non cash charge of  to adjust the carrying value of excess leaf tobacco inventory for the quest product  based on estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand for the product or market conditions are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
employee benefit plans 
the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 

table of contents net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense aggregated approximately  for  and we currently anticipate such expense will be approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  any additional funding obligation that we may have for subsequent years is contingent on several factors and is not reasonably estimable at this time

liggett and other united states cigarette manufacturers have been named as defendants in a number of direct and third party actions and purported class actions predicated on the theory that they should be liable for damages from cancer and other adverse health effects alleged to have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to so called secondary smoke from cigarettes 
we believe  and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that liggett has a number of valid defenses to claims asserted against it 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
in may  a florida intermediate appellate court overturned a  punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle smoking and health class action 
in may  the florida supreme court agreed to review the case  and oral argument was held in november 
table of contents if the intermediate appellate court s ruling is not upheld on appeal  it will have a material adverse effect on us 
in november  liggett filed the  bond required under the bonding statute enacted in by the florida legislature which limits the size of any bond required  pending appeal  to stay execution of a punitive damages verdict 
in may  liggett reached an agreement with the class in the engle case  which provided assurance to liggett that the stay of execution  in effect pursuant to the florida bonding statute  would not be lifted or limited at any point until completion of all appeals  including to the united states supreme court 
as required by the agreement  liggett paid  into an escrow account to be held for the benefit of the engle class  and released  along with liggett s existing  statutory bond  to the court for the benefit of the class upon completion of the appeals process  regardless of the outcome of the appeal 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the verdict  which was subject to the outcome of the engle appeal  has been overturned as a result of the appellate court s ruling discussed above 
in april  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of against liggett in an individual action 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of liggett has appealed the verdict 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
an unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking and health case could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
in recent years  there have been a number of adverse regulatory  political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
neither we nor liggett are able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation or regulation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against liggett or the costs of defending such cases 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation

this additional amount is based on the amount of cash dividends actually paid by us per share on our common stock during the prior three month period ending on the record date for such interest payment multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock into which the notes are convertible on such record date together  the total interest 
notwithstanding the foregoing  however  during the period prior to november   the interest payable on each interest payment date is the higher of i the total interest and ii per year

the conversion price  which was of at december   is subject to adjustment for various events  including the issuance of stock dividends 
the notes will mature on november  we must redeem of the total aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding on november  in addition to such redemption amount  we will also redeem on november  and on each interest accrual period thereafter an additional amount  if any  of the notes necessary to prevent the notes from being treated as an applicable high yield discount obligation under the internal revenue code

the conversion price  which was at december   is subject to adjustment for various events  and any cash distribution on our common stock results in a corresponding decrease in the conversion price

a total of  principal amount of the notes were outstanding at december  our consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent temporary differences in the application of accounting rules established by generally accepted accounting principles and income tax laws 
as of december   our deferred income tax liabilities exceeded our deferred income tax assets by  the largest component of our deferred tax liabilities exists because of 
table of contents differences that resulted from a and transaction with philip morris incorporated in which a subsidiary of liggett contributed three of its premium brands to trademarks llc  a newly formed limited liability company 
in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest commencing in march for additional information concerning the philip morris brand transaction  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the transaction  we recognized in a pre tax gain of  in our consolidated financial statements and established a deferred tax liability of  relating to the gain 
upon exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march  we will be required to pay tax in the amount of the deferred tax liability  which will be offset by the benefit of any deferred tax assets  including any net operating losses  available to us at that time 
in connection with an examination of our and federal income tax returns  the internal revenue service issued to us in september a notice of proposed adjustment 
the notice asserts that  for tax reporting purposes  the entire gain should have been recognized in and in in the additional amounts of  and  respectively  rather than upon the exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march if the internal revenue service were to ultimately prevail with the proposed adjustment  it would result in the potential acceleration of tax payments of approximately  including interest  net of tax benefits  through december  these amounts have been previously recognized in our consolidated financial statements as tax liabilities 
as of december   we believe amounts potentially due have been fully provided for in our consolidated statements of operations 
we believe the positions reflected on our income tax returns are correct and intend to vigorously oppose any proposed adjustments to our returns 
we have filed a protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service 
no payment is due with respect to these matters during the appeal process 
interest currently is accruing on the disputed amounts at a rate of  with the rate adjust quarterly based on rates published by the us treasury department 
if taxing authorities were to ultimately prevail in their assertion that we incurred a tax obligation prior to the exercise dates of these options and we were required to make such tax payments prior to or  and if any necessary financing were not available to us  our liquidity could be materially adversely affected

off balance sheet arrangements we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual property rights 
payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount  and in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not been material 
as of december   we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  in connection with the philip morris brand transaction  eve holdings inc  a subsidiary of liggett  guaranteed a  bank loan to trademarks llc 
the loan is secured by trademarks three premium cigarette brands and trademarks interest in the exclusive license of the three brands by philip morris 
the license provides for a minimum annual royalty payment equal to the annual debt service on the loan plus  we believe that the fair value of eve s guarantee was negligible at december  in december  new valley s subsidiary  western realty development llc  sold all the membership interests in western realty investments llc to andante limited 
in august  andante submitted an indemnification claim to western realty development alleging losses of  from breaches of various representations made in the purchase agreement 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  western realty development has no obligation to indemnify andante unless the aggregate amount of all claims for indemnification made by andante exceeds  and andante is required to bear the first of any proven loss 
new valley would be responsible for of any damages payable by western realty development

under the agreement  liggett vector brands has agreed to pay a portion of losses  if any  incurred by the surety under the bond program  with a maximum loss exposure of for liggett vector brands 
to secure its potential obligations under the agreement  liggett vector brands has delivered to the subsidiary of the association a letter of credit and agreed to fund up to an additional liggett vector brands has incurred no losses to date under this agreement  and we believe the fair value of liggett vector brands obligation under the agreement was immaterial at december  at december   we had outstanding approximately  of letters of credit  collateralized by certificates of deposit 
the letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space  to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements
