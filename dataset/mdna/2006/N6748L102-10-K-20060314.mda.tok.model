item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified orthopedic products company offering a broad line of minimally invasive surgical  as well as non surgical  products for the spine  reconstruction and trauma market sectors 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are non invasive stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  and bracing products used for ligament injury prevention  pain management and protection of surgical repairs to promote faster healing 
our products also include a device for enhancing venous circulation  cold therapy  other pain management products  bone cement and devices for removal of the bone cement used to fix artificial implants  a bone substitute compound and airway management products 
we have administrative and training facilities in the united states  the united kingdom and italy and manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  italy  mexico and the seychelles 
we directly distribute our products in the united states  the united kingdom  ireland  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico  brazil and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the equity method of accounting is used when we have significant influence over significant operating decisions but do not hold control 
under the equity method  original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies 
all material intercompany transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of the shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency fluctuation exposures 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we manage our operations as three business segments americas orthofix  americas breg  and international orthofix 
americas orthofix consists of the operations in the united states  excluding the operations of breg  as well as operations in mexico  brazil and puerto rico 
americas breg consists of breg s domestic and independent international distributor operations 
international orthofix consists of operations which are located in the rest of the world as well as independent export distribution operations 
group activities are comprised of the parent s operating expenses and identifiable assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  investments  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions and believe our estimates for the carrying values of assets and liabilities are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for bone growth stimulation and certain bracing products that are prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on and accepted by the patient 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify fob destination 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues in the united states from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
some billings are subject to review by such third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves in excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory write down in the future may be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  the ongoing impact was that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
as a result  we evaluate the recoverability and measure the potential impairment of our goodwill under sfas the annual impairment test requires an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit  which involves judgment 
we performed the impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas no 
and noted no impairment related to the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we and our operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety  employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve substantial amounts of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and client base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 
selected financial data the following table presents certain items in our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of intangible assets total operating income net income net income for includes million of net income after tax related to the kci settlement

the increase in sales was primarily the result of a increase in sales in the spine market sector attributable to sales of cervical stim which was approved by the fda in december  and growth in the sales of spinal stim  used for lumbar applications 
the americas reconstruction market sector increased in compared to this growth continues to be driven by fixation products used in reconstruction applications  including the recently introduced growth plate the eight plate and the iskd limb lengthening system 
these increases in the americas spine and reconstruction market sectors were partially offset by a decrease in the americas trauma market sector in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to a decline in external fixation sales used in trauma applications as well as decline in physio stim long bone stimulation sales resulting from increased competition and the cannibalization of some stimulation sales  previously recorded in the trauma market sector  by the recent introduction of the cervical stim 
in the americas trauma market sector  external fixation devices are sharing the market for treatment of difficult fractures with alternatives such as plating  nailing and biologics 
recognizing this trend  we have introduced the vps contour plate for distal radius fractures  the osteomax bone void filler product line  and anticipate the introduction of other internal fixation and biologic products to our americas trauma product line

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million in interest income interest income earned on cash balances held during the period was million in compared to million in interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in primarily due to an increase of approximately million in the amortization of debt placement costs resulting from the prepayment of debt on the senior secured term loan and an increase in interest rates in these additional costs were offset by lower interest expense incurred on lower outstanding debt balances following debt prepayments as well as the termination of an interest rate swap agreement that reduced interest expense by million 
loss in joint venture  net in  we did not record a loss in joint venture and in we recorded a net loss of million 
during  we sold part of our ownership in the orthorx joint venture 
this sale resulted in a gain of approximately million 
the gain was offset by our portion of the joint venture s operating losses in of approximately million 
as of december  our ownership percentage in the joint venture was and our investment in the joint venture had been reduced to zero through the equity method of accounting 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was income of million in compared to income of million in other income in was attributable to million of deferred royalty income resulting from the conclusion of the bonesource agreement with stryker which was partially offset by million of foreign currency losses

kci settlement  net of related costs in september  we reached an agreement to settle our case against kinetics concepts inc kci 
the gain  net of related costs  for was million  compared to costs of million in the net gain recorded in was subject to adjustment based on potential differences between the amount accrued and final contractual obligations 
in the first quarter of  we entered into final agreements with certain former owners of novamedix  which established the amount we will be required to disburse in connection with the kci litigation settlement 
as a result of these negotiations  we expect to disburse approximately million instead of the million accrued at december  the difference of approximately million will be recorded as income in the first quarter of income tax expense in and  the effective tax rate was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was primarily affected by the kci settlement gain recorded at novamedix distribution limited  a wholly owned cypriot subsidiary  which is in a favorable tax jurisdiction 
excluding the nonrecurring kci settlement  our effective tax rate was approximately for the increase in our effective tax rate excluding the kci litigation settlement is primarily attributable to a change in tax law in the united kingdom and earning more taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions such as the united states

on a pro forma basis breg sales increased when compared to and would have represented of our total net sales in net sales in international orthofix international increased to million in from million in international net sales represented and of our total net sales in and  respectively 
the primary factors that led to this increase were currency  increased sales of external fixation products  strong start up sales of the pccp hip fracture fixation system and growth of non orthopedic airway management products  these were partially offset by a decrease in sales of the a v impulse system  primarily the impad component 
the decrease in a v impulse system sales was due to a combination of lower contract pricing  a more competitive environment and inventory balancing in the second quarter by our primary customer in the united states 
the impact of foreign currency increased international sales by million for  primarily as a result of a stronger euro and uk pound against the us dollar

these increases in non cash items were partially offset by deferred royalties received from the stryker settlement of million 
working capital accounts generated million of cash  including million related to the accrual for amounts due to the former novamedix shareholders as part of the kci litigation settlement  in compared to the use of million in cash during  of which million resulted from the reclassification of cash as restricted cash 
excluding the kci litigation settlement  working capital accounts consumed million in primarily due to the increases in accounts receivable to support additional sales 
overall performance indicators of our two primary working capital accounts  accounts receivable and inventory  reflect days sales in receivables of days at december  compared to at december  and inventory turnover of times at december  compared to times at december  net cash used in investing activities was million during  compared to million during net cash used in investing activities in was comprised of capital expenditures for tangible assets of approximately million and intangible assets of approximately million 
in  we anticipate the use of cash for tangible and intangible capital expenditures will be approximately net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to cash used in financing activities of million in in  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options  warrants and shares purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in  we repaid approximately million against the principal of our senior secured term loan  and paid million against other outstanding debt 
by march   we anticipate repaying the remaining outstanding balance on our senior secured term loan of million and canceling the revolver under this facility 
when we acquired breg on december   one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  colgate medical limited colgate  entered into a senior secured bank credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions to finance the transaction 
the senior secured bank facility provides for a five year amortizing term loan facility of million  the proceeds of which were used for partial payment of the purchase price of breg  and a five year revolving credit facility of million 
as of december  and as of march   we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and million outstanding under the term loan facility 
obligations under the senior secured bank facility have a floating interest rate of libor or prime rate plus a margin  currently libor plus  which is adjusted quarterly based on colgate s leverage ratio 
in may we entered into a three year fully amortizable interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million and an expiration date of june  due to accelerated prepayment of the term loan  we terminated the swap agreement on december  and recorded a gain on cash received of million as a reduction to interest expense 
our effective interest rate as of december  on our senior secured debt was 
orthofix and each of colgate s direct and indirect subsidiaries  including orthofix inc and breg  have guaranteed the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility 
the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility and colgate s subsidiaries under their guarantees are secured by the pledges of their respective assets 
certain of our other subsidiaries have also guaranteed the obligations of colgate under the senior secured bank facility on a limited recourse basis 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and unused available lines of credit of approximately million euros million under a line of credit established in italy to finance the working capital of our italian operations 
the terms of the line of credit give us the option to borrow amounts in italy at rates determined at the time of borrowing 
we continue to search for viable acquisition candidates that would expand our global presence as well as additional products appropriate for current distribution channels 
an acquisition of another company or product line by us could result in our incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities 
we believe that current cash balances together with projected cash flows from operating activities  the unused revolving credit facility and available italian line of credit  the exercise of stock options  and our remaining available debt capacity are sufficient to cover anticipated operating capital needs and research and development costs over the near term 
contractual obligations the following chart sets forth our contractual obligations as of december contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands less than to to over total year years years years senior secured term loan   other borrowings operating leases      total      in addition to scheduled contractual obligations of the debt as set forth above  our senior secured bank facility requires us to make mandatory prepayments with a the excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement of colgate and its subsidiaries in an amount equal to of the excess annual cash flow of colgate and its subsidiaries  provided we maintain a leverage ratio of less than or equal to to  b the net cash proceeds of any debt or equity issuances  excluding the exercise of stock options  by any of the credit parties as defined in the credit agreement  c the net cash proceeds of asset dispositions over a minimum threshold  or d unless reinvested  insurance proceeds or condemnation awards 
during  we voluntarily prepaid million which was applied to the excess annual cash flow obligation 
after applying the voluntary prepayments  we have no additional obligation under the excess cash flow provision as of and for the period ended december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
these exposures can vary sales  cost of goods  and costs of operations  the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
however  our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had a currency hedge transaction in place to balance our euro denominated current liabilities with our euro denominated current assets 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our senior secured term loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
therefore  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under our senior secured term loans at an interest rate of 
based on the balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december  an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate on the variable rate debt would cause an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we face cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or great britain pound and sell those products in us dollars 
we face transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
we also face currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
the us dollar equivalent of international sales denominated in foreign currencies was favorably impacted in and by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the local foreign currency in and the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies was unfavorably impacted in and as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results
