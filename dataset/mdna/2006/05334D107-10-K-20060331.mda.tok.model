item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a focus on developing and marketing products for urology  sexual health and other indications within specialty markets 
we currently have a sales and marketing organization of approximately people 
our only marketed product  testim  is a proprietary  topical testosterone once a day gel indicated for the treatment of hypogonadism 
hypogonadism is defined as reduced or absent secretion of testosterone which can lead to symptoms such as loss of libido  adverse changes in body composition  irritability and poor concentration 
we reported revenues in of million  an increase of over the million reported in according to national prescription audit data from ims health  inc or ims  a pharmaceutical market research firm  testim s share of total prescriptions for the gel segment of the testosterone replacement therapy  or trt  market was for the month of december  compared with for the month of december for the full year  testim s share of total prescriptions for the trt market was  versus for the full year we target diseases with unmet medical needs that we believe can be addressed by more innovative  effective or easy to use products 
our current product pipeline includes five projects in clinical development  two pain product candidates in pre clinical development  and rights to six additional pain product candidates  options to additional indications for our injectable enzyme and other products for urology and sexual health 
our lead project is aa  an injectable enzyme 
we have an option to license all non topical uses of aa  and we currently are pursuing three indications dupuytren s disease  peyronie s disease and adhesive capsulitis  or frozen shoulder syndrome 
we believe that aa has completed phase ii of development for the treatment of dupuytren s disease and is in phase ii of development for the treatment of peyronie s disease and frozen shoulder syndrome 
each of these disease states is characterized by patients suffering the debilitating effects and deformities of scar tissue 
aa was identified for in licensing because of its application for the treatment of peyronie s disease  which is a plaque or hard scar on the shaft of the penis that causes substantial distortion of the penis upon erection 
men suffering from peyronie s disease are often unable to engage in sexual intercourse due to the deformity of their erection 

table of contents in the process of pursuing aa for the treatment of peyronie s disease  we saw completed clinical work and an opportunity to pursue aa for the treatment of dupuytren s disease 
dupuytren s disease results when a patient has excess scar tissue that collects at the tendons in the hand 
typically it results in forming a cord affecting the ring and small finger  causing the finger to contract  leaving the patient unable to fully extend the affected finger s 
aa was identified as a potential treatment for frozen shoulder syndrome by the licensor of aa we exercised our option to expand our license for aa to include its application for the treatment of frozen shoulder syndrome based on the results of a phase ii clinical trial conducted by the licensor of aa which suggests that local injection of aa is well tolerated and may be effective in patients suffering from frozen shoulder syndrome 
frozen shoulder syndrome is a disease of diminished shoulder motion  characterized by restriction in both active and passive range of motion of the shoulder joint 
we have in licensed a platform technology for the delivery of hormones and pharmaceutical products through the oral mucosal membrane 
aa  is a trt for the treatment of hypogonadism that utilizes this transmucosal film technology 
we believe aa has completed phase ii of development and expect to commence phase iii trials early in the second quarter of we also have a project  which we refer to as aa  and referred to as aa erroneously in a press release and during our earnings conference call on march   in phase i of development for the treatment for overactive bladder using the same transmucosal film delivery system 
overactive bladder is a medical condition affecting both men and women characterized by urinary urgency and increased frequency of urination 
we have two pain products using our transmucosal film delivery system in pre clinical development 
we also have rights to six additional pain products and products for hormone replacement and urologic disease using our transmucosal film delivery system 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
commercialization expenses  development costs  and in licensing milestone payments related to existing and new product candidates and to enhance our core technologies will continue to increase in the near term 
in particular  we expect to incur increased costs for selling and marketing as a result of our co promotion agreement with oscient pharmaceuticals corp  or oscient  and as we continue to market testim  additional development and pre commercialization costs for existing and new product opportunities  acquisition costs for new product opportunities and increased general and administration expense to support the infrastructure required to grow and operate as a public company 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we expect that quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors including the overall growth of the androgen market  the timing and extent of research and development efforts  milestone payments liability and the outcome and extent of clinical trial activities 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult 
net revenues 
to date  all of our net revenues have been generated by the sales and out licensing of testim 
we expect testim to continue to be the primary source of our net revenues 
we sell testim to pharmaceutical wholesalers and some chain drug stores 
these companies have the right to return testim 
as a result  we recognize revenue based on prescription units dispensed to patients  since they are not subject to return 
we will continue to recognize revenue upon prescription units dispensed until we have sufficient history to estimate product returns 
when we are able to reasonably estimate our product returns  we will recognize a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred  net of appropriate allowances for cash discounts  rebates  patient coupons and product returns 
we continue to gather experience with our returns and believe that we will be in a position to reasonably estimate returns during we do not anticipate 
table of contents sales of testim outside of the us  pursuant to our agreements with bayer  inc  or bayer  and ipsen farmaceutica  bv  or ipsen  to have a material impact on our revenues or profitability 
in addition to the up front and milestone payments these agreements afford us  we believe they also benefit us by providing opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies through increased sales of testim  as well as  making us an attractive partner to future licensors by providing us with global development and commercialization capabilities 
we may seek to generate additional revenues from the expansion of testim into new markets and the commercialization of new products 
we are a relatively new company and our sales prospects are uncertain 
we expect our revenues to fluctuate due to market acceptance and pricing for testim  including any change in wholesaler purchasing patterns  commercialization of and market acceptance of our future products  if any  regulatory approvals and market acceptance of new and competing products  including generics  government or private healthcare reimbursement policies  particularly with respect to testim and our other product candidates  promotional efforts of solvay and its impact on sales  and a switch to recognizing revenues at the point when sales are made to wholesalers 
we use a third party distributor  ics  a division of amerisource bergen  for commercial distribution activities 
the majority of our sales in the us are to pharmaceutical wholesalers that  in turn  distribute product to chain and other retail pharmacies  hospitals  mail order providers and other institutional customers 
approximately of testim purchases are from four customers cardinal health  mckesson  amerisource bergen and walgreens 
outside of the us  we currently rely on third parties to market  sell and distribute testim and any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval from any foreign jurisdictions 
for canada  we have an agreement with bayer to market and distribute testim 
we have entered into an agreement with ipsen for the rest of the world  excluding the us  canada  japan and mexico 
cost of goods sold 
all of our cost of goods sold currently relate to the sale of testim 
cost of goods sold consists of raw materials  fees paid to our contract manufacturers and related costs  royalty payments  which currently consist solely of payments due to bentley  personnel costs associated with quality assurance and manufacturing oversight  and distribution costs  including warehousing  freight and product liability insurance 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our gross margin rate in the us we anticipate our gross margins for sales outside the us to be significantly lower than those seen in the us this is due to a combination of factors which include the terms of our distribution agreements with bayer and ipsen and the royalty payments due to our licensor 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist of salaries and expenses for our development personnel  payments to consultants  investigators  contract research organizations and manufacturers in connection with our preclinical and clinical trials  
table of contents costs of developing and obtaining regulatory approvals  and product license and milestone fees paid prior to regulatory approval 
since our inception through december   we have spent million on testim  million on the development of aa for the treatment of dupuytren s disease  peyronie s disease and frozen shoulder syndrome and million on aa  our testosterone replacement film product candidate  and aa  our overactive bladder transmucosal film product candidate 
these amounts represent our external research and development costs  including up front and milestone payments  for these projects 
we do not allocate salaries or administrative expenses to development projects 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the cost to complete projects in development cannot be reasonably estimated 
currently  testim is our only marketed product 
we believe aa has completed phase ii of development for the treatment of dupuytren s disease 
aa is in phase ii of development for the treatment of peyronie s disease and frozen shoulder syndrome 
we believe aa has completed phase ii of development and aa is in phase i of development 
results from clinical trials may not be favorable 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and may be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that may significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
we expect our research and development expenses for our current products to increase as a result of further development of aa for dupuytren s disease  peyronie s disease and frozen shoulder syndrome  and our testosterone replacement transmucosal film 
in addition  the current regulatory and political environment at the us food and drug administration  or fda  could lead to increased data requirements which could impact regulatory timelines and costs 
we expect further significant increases in our expenditures to develop any other potential new product candidates that we would in license or acquire 
expenditures will increase to develop any other product candidates that we in license or acquire 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  marketing and promotion costs  professional fees and facilities costs 
we anticipate increases in selling  general and administrative expenses due to sales and marketing costs associated with testim  hiring of additional personnel  our co promotion agreement with oscient  investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
see a description of our co promote agreement with oscient set forth below under the heading contractual commitments 
results of operations years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prescription units dispensed increased from approximately  in to approximately  in we believe that testim prescription growth in over was attributed to increasing physician and patient awareness that testim provides better patient outcomes  the shift in prescriptions away from the testosterone patch product to testim  the continued focus of our sales force on the promotion of testim to urologists  endocrinologists and select primary care physicians  and our co promotion agreement with oscient  which focuses on broadening our exposure to primary care physicians 
the increase in net revenues in over also are a result of price increases having a cumulative impact of offset by increases in wholesaler discounts due to increased distribution costs  product rebates as testim became more widely prescribed by managed care providers and had experienced an increased utilization of patient coupons 
net revenues in also include million of product shipped to ipsen and million of revenues related to up front and milestone payments for which there are no comparable amounts in net revenues for testim product sales are reflected net of cash discounts  rebates and patient coupons 
shipments in the us not recognized as revenue  net of anticipated cash discounts  were million and million at december  and  respectively and are reflected in deferred revenue  current portion 

table of contents cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold in over was directly attributable to the increase in testim prescription revenue in the us and million of costs associated with product shipped to ipsen for which there is no comparable amount in cost of goods sold in the period would have been approximately million higher had purchases of a key raw material not been charged off in gross margin on our net revenues was in compared to in gross margin for us revenues was in and would have been in had purchases of a key raw material not been charged off in the improvement in gross margin in over resulted primarily from the net effect of price increases offset by increases in wholesaler discounts  product rebates and increased utilization of patient coupons 
in  we purchased approximately million of this raw material prior to fda approval of testim and  based on our policy  charged the purchase price to research and development expense because we would have had no alternative use for the raw material if testim were not approved 
as of december   we did not have any of the raw material with zero book value remaining in inventory 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in over was primarily due to million increase in development work for aa  a million increase in costs associated with phase iv clinical trials for testim  a million increase in development work for aa  and the million up front payment for the in license of eight separate pain products using the transmucosal film technology in february these increases were offset by a million decrease in milestone payments for aa  our dupuytren s disease  peyronie s disease and frozen shoulder syndrome product candidate 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in over was due primarily to selling and marketing expenses increasing by million resulting from increases in our sales force made in late  higher marketing costs associated with our co promote agreement with oscient and the oscient co promotion fees 
we anticipate significant increases in selling and marketing expenses due to  among other things  our share of increased marketing costs associated with our co promotion agreement with oscient and increases in the oscient co promotion fees 
general and administrative expenses increased by million as a result of the investigation initiated by the audit committee of our board of directors into certain transactions and the effectiveness of our internal disclosure controls and procedures described in more detail in item a of this report  severance accruals related to the termination of our former president and chief operating officer  an increase in recruiting costs  costs associated with moving to our new headquarters and incremental costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net was and million for the years ended and  respectively 
net interest income in relates primarily to interest earned on the invested proceeds from our initial public offering in july of and our private placement in june of the expense in relates primarily to non cash amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to a line of credit and to interest paid on the line of credit  which was repaid and terminated in march other income expense  net 
other income expense  net was million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other income expense  net in relates to million of placement agent fees and transaction costs associated with the june  private placement which were allocated to the financing related liability and the non cash change in the fair value of the financing related liability of million during on december   we reclassified the financing related liability of million to permanent equity as a result of amendments to the securities purchase agreements 
we do not expect any future expense related to the financing related liability 
dividends and accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock was and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  
table of contents we were accreting the carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock to its redemption value 
there is no corresponding accretion in as all previously outstanding shares of this stock were converted into our common stock in connection with our initial public offering 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire in through  if not utilized 
in addition  we had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  of which million relate to pennsylvania 
the pennsylvania state net operating losses are subject to a million annual limitation for years and expire in through at december   we had federal research and development credits of approximately million that will expire in through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited 
additionally  us tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  therefore we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal income tax purposes years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues were million and million for and  respectively 
net revenues consist solely of revenues resulting from approximately  and  prescription units dispensed in and  respectively 
we believe that the increase in net revenues and underlying prescription units is the result of many factors  including was the first complete year of sales as we launched testim in the first quarter of  growth in the trt gel market  growth in our market share and new prescriptions  increased effectiveness of our sales and marketing organization  positioning of testim s attributes versus the category leader  price increases and contribution of better formulary positions with managed care providers 
while testim continued to gain market share throughout  the annual rate of growth in the overall gel segment slowed 
the annual growth rate in total gel prescriptions was in versus in net revenues for testim product sales are reflected net of cash discounts  rebates and patient coupons 
shipments in the us not recognized as revenue  net of anticipated cash discounts  were million and million at december  and  respectively and are reflected in deferred revenue  current portion 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold for over was directly attributable to the increase in testim prescription revenue 
cost of goods sold in and would have been approximately million and million higher  respectively  had purchases of a key raw material not been charged off in gross margin on our net product sales was in compared to in the improvement in gross margin in over resulted primarily from fixed manufacturing costs spread across an increased number of units sold 
gross margin would have been for and for had purchases of a key raw material not been written off in in  we purchased approximately million of this raw material prior to fda approval of testim and  based on our policy  charged the purchase price to research and development expense because we would have had no alternative use for the raw material if testim were not approved 
as of december   we did not have any of the raw material with zero book value remaining in inventory 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in over was due primarily to million in up front and milestone payments made to biospecifics technologies corp  or biospecifics  for the in license of aa  our dupuytren s and peyronie s diseases product candidate  and million of additional development expenses for aa in addition  the increase in over is a result of the million increase in development expenses on our testosterone replacement and overactive bladder transmucosal film product candidates and million increase in expenses associated with the testim european regulatory filing and testim clinical trials 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase in over was due primarily to a million increase in general and administrative expenses and a million increase in selling and marketing expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses results from additional hiring of key personnel  relocation and recruitment expenses and incremental costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses results from compensation and related expenses for our professional sales organization being greater in versus due to higher headcount and incentive compensation related to sales volume achievements 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net was million and million for and  respectively 
the net expense in and relates primarily to non cash amortization of deferred debt issuance costs related to a line of credit and to interest paid on the line of credit 
the line of credit was entered into in may and repaid and terminated in march although we arranged for a replacement line of credit with comerica bank  the weighted average borrowings on the replacement line in were lower than under the previously existing line in in an attempt to control interest costs 
the debt issuance costs were the result of warrants issued to investors to guarantee the line of credit 
other income 
other income for was million due to a one time gain from the settlement of a lawsuit with a vendor 
dividends and accretion on redeemable convertible preferred stock 
dividends accrued and accretion on redeemable convertible preferred stock and dividends paid to warrant holders were million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was due to the termination and cancellation of the accumulated dividend provisions of our preferred stock in connection with the private placement of shares of our series d preferred stock in october in april  we removed a variable feature of our outstanding warrants to purchase series d preferred stock and fixed both the amount of warrants and the exercise price of the warrants 
as a result  we recorded a million deemed dividend in the second quarter of for the increase in the fair value of the warrants attributable to the amendments of the warrant terms 
we anticipate no future dividends and accretion on redeemable convertible preferred stock as all previously outstanding shares of this stock were converted into our common stock in connection with our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources since inception through december   we have financed our product development  operations and capital expenditures primarily from private and public sales of equity securities 
since inception through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from our initial public offering  private sales of securities and the exercise of stock options 
we had approximately million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  and december   respectively 
as of december  and december   we also had million and million  respectively  in short term investments 
we believe that our current financial resources and sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund our anticipated operations until at least the end of we may  however  need to raise additional funds prior to this time in order to support our obligations under our existing or any new co promotion agreement or to enhance our sales and marketing efforts for additional products we may acquire  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and acquire or in license approved products or product candidates or technologies for development 
insufficient funds may cause us to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development  commercialization or expansion activities 
our future capital needs and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities  the cost of clinical studies and other actions needed to obtain regulatory approval of our products in development  and the timing and cost of any acquisitions 
if additional funds are required  we may raise such funds from time 
table of contents to time through public or private sales of equity or debt securities or from bank or other loans 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely impact our growth plans and our financial condition or results of operations 
additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
we have two equipment loans with general electric capital corporation totaling million outstanding at december  the equipment facilities bear interest at a weighted average rate of per annum 
sources and uses of cash cash used in operations was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
negative operating cash flows during were caused primarily by operating losses 
negative operating cash flows during result from operating losses offset primarily by million of cash collections of up front and milestone payments 
negative operating cash flows during were caused primarily by operating losses 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for relates primarily to the purchase of short term investments with part of the proceeds from our june  private placement 
cash used in investing activities for relates primarily to the purchase of short term investments with part of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
cash used in investing activities for relates primarily to the purchase of manufacturing equipment  office furniture and computer equipment  and the build out of a manufacturing line for testim 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activity in results primarily from the million received from the june  private placement and the million in cash receipts from stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities in was related primarily to the initial public offering of common stock 
during  we received million from the private placement of shares of our series d preferred stock and an additional million primarily from a line of credit offset by a million certificate of deposit reflected as restricted cash to secure borrowing under a line of credit agreement 
our actual cash needs might vary materially from those now planned because of a number of factors  including testim market acceptance and sales growth  third party payor coverage and reimbursement for testim  the cost of manufacturing  distributing  marketing and selling testim  the scope  rate of progress and cost of our product development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of commercializing any of our current product candidates or any other product candidates that we may acquire or in license  acquisition or in licensing costs  the effect of competing technological and market developments  
table of contents changes to the regulatory approval process for product candidates in those jurisdictions  including the us  in which we may be seeking approval for our product candidates  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or product acquisitions 
if we increase our debt levels  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities 
this dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue any securities 
in and  we received million and million  respectively  in payments from existing agreements for testim in other territories 
these receipts are the result of up front and milestone payments primarily related to contract signings and regulatory approvals 
in addition  we could receive as much as an additional million in if certain regulatory approvals are received outside the us we might also enter into additional arrangements with corporate partners that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
contractual commitments we are involved with in licensing of products which are generally associated with payments to the partner from whom we have licensed the product 
such payments frequently take the form of an up front payment  the size of which varies depending on the phase of the product and how many other companies would like to obtain the product  which is paid very soon after signing a license agreement  milestone payments which are paid when certain parts of the overall development program are accomplished  or in some cases  when a patent issues  payments upon certain regulatory events  such as the filing of an ind  and nda  approval of an nda  or the equivalents in other countries  and payments for achievement of certain sales thresholds  such as a payment due the first year a product achieves million in sales 
we may also out license products  for which we hold the rights  to other companies for commercialization in other territories  or at times  for other uses 
when this happens  typically there is an up front payment made at or shortly after signing a partnering agreement  milestone payments that may be made on completion of a phase of a clinical program  or regulatory approval in a given territory  and a payment or payments made upon achievement of a certain level of sales in a given year 
bentley in may  we entered into a license agreement with bentley pharmaceuticals  inc  or bentley  for its patented transdermal gel technology 
under the agreement  as amended  we were granted an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to make and sell products incorporating bentley s formulation technology that contain testosterone 
we produce testim under this agreement 
the term of this agreement is determined on 
table of contents a country by country basis and extends until the later of patent right termination in a country or years after the first sale of product in that country 
in may  we entered into a license with bentley granting similar rights for a product containing another hormone  the term of which is perpetual 
in may  we also entered into a separate license granting similar rights for a product containing a therapeutic drug 
in addition to its royalty obligations  we are obligated to pay certain upfront payments and milestones under the license agreements with bentley 
through december   we have made aggregate upfront and milestone payments under the three license agreements with bentley of approximately million 
if all events under the bentley license agreements occur  we would be obligated to pay a maximum of approximately million in milestone payments 
the timing of the above payments  if any  is uncertain 
biospecifics in june  we entered into a development and license agreement with biospecifics and amended such agreement in may and in december the biospecifics agreement 
under the biospecifics agreement  as amended  we were granted exclusive worldwide rights to develop  market and sell certain products containing biospecifics enzyme  which we refer to as aa our licensed rights concern the development of products  other than dermal formulations labeled for topical administration 
currently  we have rights to develop  and are developing  aa for the treatment of dupuytren s disease  peyronie s disease and frozen shoulder syndrome 
we may expand the biospecifics agreement  at our option  to cover other indications as they are developed by us or biospecifics 
the biospecifics agreement extends  on a country by country and product by product basis  for the longer of the patent life  the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period or years 
we may terminate the biospecifics agreement with days written notice 
we are responsible  at our own cost and expense  for developing the formulation and finished dosage form of products containing aa and arranging for the clinical supply of such products 
as permitted under the biospecifics agreement  we have qualified cobra biologics ltd  or cobra  as our primary supplier of clinical supply under the agreement 
accordingly  we will now rely on cobra as our primary supplier of aa for clinical trials 
biospecifics has the option  exercisable no later than six months after fda approval of the first new drug application or biologics license application with respect to a product  to assume the right and obligation to supply  or arrange for the supply from a third party other than a back up supplier qualified by us  of a specified portion of commercial product required by us 
the agreement provides that we may withhold a specified amount of a milestone payment until i biospecifics executes an agreement  containing certain milestones  with a third party for the commercial manufacture of the product  ii biospecifics commences construction of a facility  compliant with current good manufacturing practices  for the commercial supply of the product  or iii days after biospecifics notifies us in writing that it will not exercise the supply option 
if biospecifics exercises the supply option  commencing on a specified date  biospecifics will be responsible for supplying either by itself or through a third party other than a back up supplier qualified by us  a specified portion of the commercial supply of the product 
if biospecifics does not exercise the supply option  we will be responsible for arranging for the entire commercial product supply 
in the event biospecifics exercises the supply option  we and biospecifics are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into a commercial supply agreement on customary and reasonable terms and conditions which are not worse than those with back up suppliers qualified by us 
we must pay biospecifics on a country by country and product by product basis a specified percentage of net sales for products covered by the biospecifics agreement 
such percentage may vary depending on whether biospecifics exercises the supply option 
in addition  the percentage may be reduced if i biospecifics fails to 
table of contents supply commercial product supply in accordance with the terms of the biospecifics agreement  ii market share of a competing product exceeds a specified threshold  or iii we are required to obtain a license from a third party in order to practice biospecifics patents without infringing such third party s patent rights 
in addition to the payments set forth above  we must pay biospecifics an amount equal to a specified mark up of the cost of goods sold for products sold by us that are not manufactured by or on behalf of biospecifics  provided that  in the event biospecifics exercises the supply option  no payment will be due for so long as biospecifics fails to supply the commercial supply of the product in accordance with the terms of the biospecifics agreement 
finally  we are obligated to make contingent milestone payments upon contract initiation  receipt of technical data  manufacturing process development  the one year anniversary of the biospecifics agreement  filing of regulatory applications and receipt of regulatory approval 
through december   we paid up front and milestone payments under the biospecifics agreement of million 
in june  we paid the one year contract anniversary payment of million 
in december  we paid the option exercise fee of million for the frozen shoulder syndrome indication 
we could make up to an additional million of contingent milestone payments under the biospecifics agreement if all existing conditions are met 
additional milestone obligations may be due if we exercise an option to develop and license aa for additional medical indications 
cobra in july we entered into an agreement with cobra for the process development  scale up and manufacture of aa for phase ii iii clinical trials the cobra agreement 
accordingly  we will now rely on cobra as our primary supplier of aa for clinical trials 
the cobra agreement is divided into five non sequential stages with specific objectives  timelines  down payments and total payments that attach to each stage 
we may terminate the cobra agreement at the completion of each stage if the objective or the timeline for such stage is not met 
through december   we incurred a total of million under the cobra agreement 
if all remaining stages are completed under the current cobra agreement  then we will pay cobra an additional million 
althea in order to prepare aa for clinical trials  aa bulk substance produced by cobra must be filled and lyophilized  placebo must be manufactured and a sterile diluent must be produced collectively  pharmaceutical products 
on february   we entered into a manufacturing and clinical supply agreement with althea technologies  inc  or althea  to be effective as of january  that sets out the general terms and conditions under which althea will produce these pharmaceutical products in bulk or finished dosage form for our development and or clinical use only 
at the time we executed the agreement  we and althea entered into a project plan that provides the parameters for the production of pharmaceutical products 
pursuant to the project plan we will supply bulk substance of aa produced by cobra to althea which  in turn  will produce and deliver to us the pharmaceutical products 
the agreement provides that we will pay althea of the total fees due to althea upon signing of the project plan 
then  althea will invoice us monthly for services completed during such month  and the balance of the fees will be invoiced upon delivery of the pharmaceutical products 
upon signing of the project plan in february  we paid to althea  and we expect to incur an additional  under this project plan in pharmaform in june  we expanded our drug delivery technology portfolio by entering into a license agreement with formulation technologies  llc  d b a pharmaform  or pharmaform 
under this agreement  as amended  we were granted an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license to develop  make and sell products that contain 
table of contents hormones or that are used to treat urologic disorders incorporating pharmaform s oral transmucosal film technology for which there is an issued patent in the us the term of this license agreement is for the life of the licensed patents 
in february  we entered into an additional license agreement with pharmaform 
under this agreement  we were granted exclusive  worldwide royalty bearing rights to develop  manufacture and market eight compounds using pharmaform s proprietary transmucosal film technology for the management of pain  including acute and chronic pain 
the compounds that may be developed include opioids as well other types of analgesics 
in  we paid an up front payment of million and could make up to an additional million in contingent milestone payments if all underlying events for these eight products occur 
in addition  we will have on going royalty payment obligations to pharmaform 
the timing of the remaining payments  if any  is uncertain 
to speed the development of products using the licensed technology from pharmaform  we entered into a research and development agreement with pharmaform on a fee for service basis 
we will be the sole owner of any intellectual property rights developed in connection with this agreement 
we incurred million under the research and development agreement in and expect to incur million in oscient in april  we entered into a co promotion agreement the oscient agreement with oscient whereby we and oscient will co promote testim in the us oscient was granted the exclusive right to promote testim jointly with us to primary care physicians by means of its sales force 
oscient commenced co promotion of testim in may the initial term of the oscient agreement ends on april  oscient may extend the oscient agreement for two consecutive two year periods provided that oscient has met certain milestones for each extension 
if these milestones are met and oscient does not elect to terminate the oscient agreement  the first extension period will commence on january  and end on december  and the second extension period will commence effective january  and end on april  we and oscient utilize a joint marketing and promotion plan which sets forth the responsibilities of both parties with respect to the marketing and promotion of testim in the us primary care physician market 
we and oscient share equally these promotional expenses 
each party will be responsible for the costs associated with its own sales force 
the combined spending for marketing and promotion of testim in the primary care physician market in the us was million  and we estimate that the total costs for will be approximately million to million 
these costs will be shared equally 
oscient will be compensated for its services based on a specified percentage of the gross profit from testim sales attributable to primary care physicians in the us that exceed a specified sales threshold the oscient co promotion fees 
all gross profit earned on sales to primary care physicians below the predetermined threshold and all gross profit earned on all sales to non primary care physicians are not subject to the terms of the oscient agreement 
once sales to primary care physicians have exceeded the predetermined sales threshold  the gross profit earned on such sales is available to be split between us and oscient 
once all agreed upon promotional expenses are appropriately reimbursed to each party  the gross profit remaining will be divided according to agreed upon percentages 
the specific percentages are based upon testim sales levels above the threshold attributable to primary care physicians actually achieved 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of expense for the oscient co promotion fees 
the agreed upon promotional expenses for each year are reimbursable equally and simultaneously to each company through the profit split mechanism  except in when oscient will be disproportionately reimbursed its share of the promotional expenses through the profit split mechanism 
as the agreed upon percentage of the gross profit available to be split in was insufficient to reimburse oscient its share of the promotional expenses  that portion not reimbursed to oscient will be carried over to and will be reimbursed through the profit split mechanism 
of the million expense recorded by us for the year ended december   million was due to this carry over reimbursement 

table of contents the oscient agreement may be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of certain termination events 
we may be obligated to make termination payments in certain instances 
also  oscient has been granted the exclusive option to co promote any future product candidate of ours that treats hypogonadism and contains testosterone as the active ingredient 
we will invoice and record in its financial statements all sales of testim  including those sales to primary care physicians that exceed the specified threshold  as well as the gross profit earned on all sales 
we will record our share of promotional expenses incurred and the oscient co promotion fees as selling  general administration operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
the following summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in thousands total less than year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase commitment amount represents a minimum annual manufacturing fee of million 
the contractual commitments reflected in this table exclude million of contingent milestone payments that we may be obligated to pay in the future 
we do not expect to pay any of these contingent milestone payments through december  these remaining milestones relate primarily to manufacturing process development  filing of regulatory applications and receipt of regulatory approval 
the above table also excludes future royalty payments and wholesaler distribution fees because they are contingent on product sales 
in addition  the above table excludes any co promotional expenses and fees that may be due oscient because they are contingent upon combined promotional expenditures and future product sales to primary care physicians  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  which are based on our consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we are subject to uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from these estimates  such as changes in the healthcare environment  competition  legislation and regulation 
we believe the following accounting policies  which have been discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical because they involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and estimating the value of our equity instruments for use in stock based compensation calculations 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we sell testim to pharmaceutical wholesalers and chain drug stores 
these companies have the right to return testim for any reason up to one year after product expiration 
as a result of testim s launch in the first quarter of  we do not have sufficient sales history to estimate product returns 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 we defer recognition of revenue on product shipments of testim to our us customers until such time as testim units are dispensed through patient prescriptions  since they are not subject to return 
under sfas no 
 we cannot recognize revenue on product shipments until we can reasonably estimate returns relating to these shipments 
we estimate the volume of prescription units dispensed at pharmacies based on data provided by external  independent sources 
these sources poll pharmacies  hospitals  mail order and other retail outlets for testim prescriptions and project this sample on a national level 
we will continue to recognize revenue based on prescription units until we have sufficient history to estimate product returns 
when we are able to reasonably estimate our product returns  we will recognize a one time increase in net revenue related to the recognition of revenue previously deferred  net of appropriate allowances for cash discounts  rebates  patient coupons and product returns 
we continue to gather experience with our returns and believe that we will be in a position to reasonably estimate returns during in addition  we must make estimates for rebates provided to third party payers and coupons provided to patients 
testim is covered by medicaid and numerous independent insurance and pharmacy benefit managers  or pbms 
some of these programs have negotiated rebates 
we obtain estimates of prescription units dispensed under the various rebate programs from the same external sources discussed above 
we make estimates of the rebates based on the external source reports of volumes and actual contract terms 
in addition  we provide coupons to physicians for use with prescriptions as promotional incentives 
we utilize a contract service provider to process and pay claims to patients for actual coupon usage 
as testim becomes more widely used and as we continue to add managed care and pbm contracts  our estimates may result in differences to actual results 
to date  our estimates have not resulted in any material adjustments to our operating results 
for revenues associated with licensing agreements  we use revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  revenues from licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the agreement 
we entered into two license and distribution agreements to market and distribute testim worldwide  excluding the us  mexico and japan 
under these agreements  the distributor and the licensee are each required to purchase testim from us and make up front  milestone and royalty payments 
under these agreements  the distributor and the licensee may each cancel the agreements if there is a breach of contract or if any party files for bankruptcy 
only milestone payments for product supply price reductions are refundable if we subsequently increase the supply price  otherwise  no up front or milestone payments are refundable in any instance 
product shipments are subject to return and refund only if the product does not comply with technical specifications or if any of the agreements are terminated due to our nonperformance 
we are obligated under the agreements to provide multiple deliverables  the license product distribution rights  regulatory filing services and commercial product supply 
under eitf no 
the deliverables under each of these agreements are treated as single units of accounting as we do not have evidence to support that the consideration for the undelivered item  testim units to be shipped  is at fair value 
revenue for testim units shipped will be recognized upon product shipment  net of estimated product returns 
we have deferred revenue recognition for non refundable up front and milestone payments until at least the first product shipment under each agreement 
we previously stated that non refundable up front and milestone revenue will be recognized as revenue as a percentage of testim units shipped in the period over total testim units expected to be shipped over the distribution term and that no such revenue will be recognized if a reasonable estimate of total future testim unit shipments cannot be made 
however  we came to the conclusion in the third quarter of that this accounting method was impractical to implement due to the uncertainty that would be created in estimating potential future sales in a large number of countries outside of the us over an extended period of time 
accordingly  commencing in the third quarter of  non refundable up front and milestone revenue will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis 
the amortization period for the agreement with ipsen is based 
table of contents upon contractual terms and currently estimated to be years 
we have started to amortize milestones received over this period since the first product has been shipped 
when earned by us in future periods  additional milestone payments achieved will be amortized over the remaining period 
refundable milestone payments will be deferred and only included in the revenue recognition equation with non refundable milestone consideration when the refund right effectively lapses 
no product shipments have been made to bayer and  therefore  no revenue relating to upfront or milestone payments have been recognized 
through december  we collected million of license payments under these agreements 
of this amount million relates to non refundable milestones from ipsen 
the remaining million consists of a million refundable milestone from ipsen and million of milestones from bayer that cannot be recognized at this time 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of revenue for up front and milestone amounts received from ipsen 
at december   million was classified as current deferred revenue and million was classified as long term deferred revenue 
inventory valuation 
we rely on a single source supplier for one of the key ingredients in testim 
as a result  we previously purchased a substantial safety stock of this ingredient on which we have limited shelf life data 
we continue to perform stability testing on the ingredient to determine its maximum shelf life 
in addition  our finished goods inventory has a definitive shelf life 
we estimate that the demand for testim will be such that the raw materials and finished goods on hand will ultimately be used in future production and sold to our customers 
as a result  we have not recorded a material valuation allowance for potential excess inventory as of december  we will continually evaluate the demand for testim and the data from the stability testing to determine whether an allowance for excess inventory is warranted 
in addition  at december  we have capitalized as work in process inventory million of testim manufactured by a back up supplier 
we intend to sell this inventory after we receive approval of the alternate testing site and the test method from the fda 
we capitalized this inventory based on favorable preliminary results from analytical testing  past product experience and our belief that it is probable that the inventory will be saleable 
if the fda does not approve the alternate testing site and test method  we will have to write off this inventory 
valuation of equity instruments used in stock based compensation 
we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting of stock based compensation 
the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
require us to disclose pro forma net loss applicable to common stockholders and net loss per common share as if we accounted for employee stock options at fair value 
sfas no 
also requires us to estimate the value of purchase rights granted to employees under our employee stock purchase plan for inclusion in the sfas no 
pro forma disclosure 
in addition  we account for stock based compensation to non employees using the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
our disclosure under sfas no 
and our accounting under eitf issue no 
require us to estimate the value of equity instruments issued 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options issued to employees and non employees and purchase rights granted to employees under our employee stock purchase plan 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make assumptions of the estimated life of the underlying options  the anticipated volatility of the price of our common stock  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield of our common stock

sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
generally the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the statement of operations based on their grant date fair values over the period during which employees are required to provide services in exchange for the award 
in addition  under sfas no 
r our employee stock purchase plan will be considered compensatory 
pro forma disclosure of stock based compensation under fair value methods is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r provides guidance on how to determine the grant date fair value for awards of equity instruments as well as alternative methods of adopting its requirements 
on april   the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r to the beginning of the first fiscal year after june  as a result  we anticipate adopting sfas no 
r on january  as we currently account for employee stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method permitted under apb opinion no 
 the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in significant additional compensation charges in our statements of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
on september   our compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of the unvested portion of out of the money stock options held by current employees 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these out of the money options was made to avoid recognizing compensation expense in future periods upon the adoption of sfas no
