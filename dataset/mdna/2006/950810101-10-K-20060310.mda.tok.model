item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s asset liability management alm function is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed regularly and reviewed by alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the earnings simulation model 
modeling changes in net interest income requires making certain assumptions regarding prepayment rates  callable bonds  and adjustments to non time deposit interest rates which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
prepayment assumptions and adjustments to non time deposit rates at varying levels of interest rates are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non time deposit rate changes will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration of the maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in modeling changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that wesbanco could employ in response to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to a stable rate or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period

the earnings simulation model projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would decrease by approximately and if interest rates were to rise immediately by and basis points  respectively 
net interest income would decrease by approximately and if interest rates were to decline by and basis points  respectively 
at december   wesbanco s increased exposure to rising interest rates was impacted by assumptions on callable bonds and by a decrease in the interest sensitivity of the loan portfolio due to an increased amount of fixed rate residential and commercial real estate loans  much of which was acquired from winton and by the shorter maturities of certificates of deposit and fhlb borrowings 
as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a worse case scenario 
the simulation model using the basis point ramp analysis projects that net interest income would decrease over the next twelve months 
wesbanco s alco evaluates various strategies to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
these strategies at december  emphasized reducing liability sensitivity in anticipation of continued rising interest rates 
among the strategies that are evaluated from time to time are the utilization of interest rate swap agreements and the evaluation of the level and possible reductions in certain fhlb borrowings 
the current interest rate swap agreements employed by wesbanco were purchased at various times in to effectively convert a portion of prime rate money market deposits to a fixed rate basis 
at december   the notional value of the interest rate swap agreements was million  compared to million at december  related market losses of million  net of tax  at december  compared to a market loss of million  net of tax  at december   are recorded in other comprehensive income 
other strategies evaluated by alco include managing the level of wesbanco s fixed rate residential real estate loans maintained in the loan portfolio versus selling them in the secondary market  potentially purchasing shorter term or variable rate residential real estate loan pools  shortening duration in the securities portfolio  emphasizing lower cost transaction based accounts  growing intermediate maturity certificate of deposit products and using liquidity from investment security proceeds from maturities  calls and repayments to fund loans
