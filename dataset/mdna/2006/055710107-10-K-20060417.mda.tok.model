additionally  revenue from procedure sales may have been deferred if any of the components necessary to perform the procedure have not been sent to the dentist or distributor 
britesmile s policy has been to not accept any return of key cards or access codes during the course of the agreement with an associated center or a distributor 
beginning in the third quarter of  britesmile introduced the smile forever program 
under various versions of the program  center customers can pay an additional fee for the right to receive touch up procedures over a one or two year period

in the event a particular associated center abandons the contract or fails to order any procedures for six months  the remaining capitalized cost of the magic mirror is written off 
at december   the capitalized amount included in assets held for sale on the balance sheet was  net of deferred revenue received from the sale of magic mirrors to customers

liquidity and capital resources general the company s principal sources of liquidity have been proceeds from issuances of common stock and debt 
at december   the company had million in cash 
to date  the company has yet to achieve profitability and it is not clear if the company will become profitable in the near term  if ever 
the company expects that its principal uses of cash will be to provide working capital to meet corporate expenses and satisfy outstanding liabilities 

table of contents the company made the following changes to its capital resources in on july   the company and excimer vision leasing evl  a related party  amended britesmile s capital lease agreement to provide that on december   evl would sell to britesmile each leased device remaining under lease at a price of per device and the term of the lease would end as of december   with no additional payments due under the lease after that date except for variable and fixed fees unpaid as of the date of the sale and any remaining deferred lease payments owed by britesmile per the august amendment to the lease 
the forgiveness of debt was recorded as a capital contribution in the amount of  as of december   the fixed portion of the capital lease was fully paid and a final bill of sale was received by the company for all of the devices under lease 
in february  the company paid evl million of deferred fees per the amended terms of the lease  leaving approximately million to be paid in february and million to be paid by february the million was paid in february and the remaining balance was paid in march from the proceeds of the sale of the associated centers business 
the company had debt of approximately million outstanding as of december  this debt was fully paid in march from the proceeds of the sale of the associated center business in march as was required by consents obtained from the debt holders related to the sale of the associated centers business 
proceeds received from the sale of the associated center business in march have been used or are reserved to be used to pay off long term debt  capital leases and accrued interest  million  to establish an escrow account from which payment can be made for claims britesmile has agreed to indemnify discus  million  to pay costs associated with the asset sale transaction  million  to establish a second escrow account to be used to reimburse expenses which may be incurred by discus in connection with defending or asserting and prosecuting specified proceedings relating to some of the patent rights acquired by discus  million  to pay outstanding legal bills related to the discus patent litigation  million  to pay employee severance  million  to resolve certain outstanding sales tax issues related to the associated centers  million  and to pay potential income and other tax related to the transaction  million 
any remaining proceeds will be used for working capital needs 
while the financial results and statements have been presented assuming discontinuance of operations consistent with fas impairment analysis  the financial statements otherwise reflect a going concern basis of accounting 
however  if the company consummates the sale of its centers business  it will no longer have any revenue from operations 
furthermore  if the sale of the centers business does not close and the company must continue to operate its center business  there can be no assurance that the company can become profitable 
if it cannot become profitable  and without additional financing which the company might not be able to secure  the company may not have sufficient liquidity to support its operating requirements through in addition  it is possible that the company will have additional cash demands as a result of potential unfavorable conclusions to the legal claims currently faced by the company 
accordingly  the company s management believes that these factors raise doubt as to whether the going concern basis of accounting reflected in these financial statements continues to be appropriate 
our liquidity projections may improve or deteriorate depending on these changing conditions 
cash requirements during the last three years  the primary uses of cash were for funding of operations  purchases of property and equipment and  to a lesser degree  debt repayments 
however  some of the proceeds realized from selling of the associated centers in march have been used to pay outstanding debt 
therefore  in the near term  the primary use of cash is expected to be salaries and benefits of certain senior management and other administrative personnel  the corporate office facility  information technology  insurance  legal fees and accounting fees  as well as costs related to the sale of the company s businesses 
if the sale of the company s centers business does not close  then cash will be used to fund the centers operations
