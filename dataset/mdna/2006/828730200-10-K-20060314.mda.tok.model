critical accounting policies overview management has reviewed its various accounting policies 
based on this review  management believes the policies most critical to the company are the policies associated with its lending practices including the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  treatment of goodwill  recognition of fee income  estimates of income taxes  and employee benefit plan as it relates to stock options 
loans loans the company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay offs are reported at their outstanding principal adjusted for any loans charged off and any deferred fees or costs on originated loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans 
interest income is reported on the interest method and includes amortization of net deferred loan fees and costs over the estimated life of the loan 
generally  loans are placed on non accrual status at ninety days past due and interest is considered a loss  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
discounts and premiums on purchased residential real estate loans are amortized to income using the interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity  adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
discounts and premiums on purchased consumer loans are recognized over the expected lives of the loans using methods that approximate the interest method 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for potential loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of period end 
this estimate is based on management s evaluation of the loan portfolio  as well as on prevailing and anticipated economic conditions and historical losses by loan category 
general reserves have been established  based upon the aforementioned factors and allocated to the individual loan categories 
allowances are accrued on specific loans evaluated for impairment for which the basis of each loan  including accrued interest  exceeds the discounted amount of expected future collections of interest and principal or  alternatively  the fair value of loan collateral 
the unallocated reserve generally serves to compensate for the uncertainty in estimating loan losses  including the possibility of changes in risk ratings and specific reserve allocations in the loan portfolio as a result of the company s ongoing risk management system 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not receive all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
this includes loans that are delinquent days or more  nonaccrual loans and certain other loans identified by management 
certain other loans identified by management consist of performing loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses 
specific allocations are applied when quantifiable factors are present requiring a greater allocation than that established using the classified asset approach  as defined by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
accrual of interest is discontinued and interest accrued and unpaid is removed at the time such amounts are delinquent days  unless management is aware of circumstances which warrant continuing the interest accrual 
interest is recognized for nonaccrual loans only upon receipt and only after all principal amounts are current according to the terms of the contract 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired subsidiaries and branches 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
and no 
eliminated the amortization for these assets as of january  although goodwill is not being amortized  it is tested annually for impairment 
fee income periodic bankcard fees  net of direct origination costs  are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period the fee entitles the cardholder to use the card 
origination fees and costs for other loans are being amortized over the estimated life of the loan 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
employee benefit plans the company has a stock based employee compensation plan 
the company accounts for this plan under recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 share based payment revised  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
the standard requires companies to expense the fair value of all stock options that have future vesting provisions  are modified  or are newly granted beginning on the grant date of such options 
sfas r became effective and was adopted by the company on january  see note  new accounting standards  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

sale of mortgage servicing during the second quarter  the company recorded a nonrecurring addition to earnings per share 
on june   the company sold its billion residential mortgage servicing portfolio 
as a result of this sale  the company established a reserve for potential liabilities due to certain representations and warranties made on the sale date 
the time period for making claims under the terms of the mortgage servicing sale s representations and warranties expired on june  thus  the company reversed this remaining reserve in the second quarter of  which is reflected in the  pre tax gain on sale of mortgage servicing 
excluding this nonrecurring gain  the company would have reported diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  net interest income net interest income  the company s principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors that determine the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned and rates paid  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate of 
the federal reserve board sets various benchmark rates  including the federal funds rate  and thereby influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions 
the federal funds rate  which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds  began at and decreased basis points to end the year at 
during  the federal funds rate increased basis points to end the year at 
during  the federal funds rate increased basis points in each of the four quarters to end the year at 
the company s practice is to limit exposure to interest rate movements by maintaining a significant portion of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in short term repricing 
historically  approximately of the company s loan portfolio and approximately of the company s time deposits have repriced in one year or less 
these historical percentages are consistent with the company s current interest rate sensitivity 
for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of million  or  from the same period in the increase in net interest income was the result of a million increase in interest income and a million increase in interest expense 
as a result  the net interest margin increased basis points to for the year ended december   when compared to for although net interest margin increased basis points from to  in the company expects to see continued pressure on the margin driven primarily by the increase in cost of funds resulting from competitive deposit repricing 
the million increase in interest income for the year ended december   primarily is the result of internal growth in loans along with a basis point increase in the yield earned on earning assets associated with the repricing to a higher interest rate environment 
the growth in average loans accounted for an increase of million in interest income 
the higher interest rates resulted in a million increase in interest income 
more specifically  million of the increase is associated with the repricing of the company s loan portfolio that resulted from loans that matured during the period or were tied to a rate that fluctuated with changes in market rates 
as a result  the average rate earned on the loan portfolio increased basis points from to 
the million increase in interest expense for the year ended december   primarily is the result of a basis point increase in cost of funds due to competitive repricing during a higher interest rate environment  coupled with a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities generated through internal growth 
the higher interest rates accounted for an million increase in interest expense 
the most significant component of this increase was the million increase associated with the repricing of the company s time deposits that resulted from time deposits that matured during the period or were tied to a rate that fluctuated with changes in market rates 
as a result of this repricing  the average rate paid on time deposits increased basis points from to 
the higher level of average interest bearing liabilities resulted in a million increase in interest expense 
more specifically  the higher level of average interest bearing liabilities was the result of increases of approximately million from internal deposit growth and million from fed funds purchased and short term debt  offset by a million reduction in average long term debt due primarily to the payoff of million of trust preferred securities in december of for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was million  an increase of million  or  from the same period in the increase in net interest income was the result of an million increase in interest income and a  increase in interest expense

the level of provision to the allowance is based on management s judgment  with consideration given to the composition of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  assessment of current economic conditions  past due and non performing loans and net loan loss experience 
it is management s practice to review the allowance on a quarterly basis to determine the level of provision made to the allowance after considering the factors noted above

the decrease in the provision for loan losses reflects the continued improvement in the company s asset quality 
non interest income total non interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in non interest income is principally derived from recurring fee income  which includes service charges  trust fees and credit card fees

the increase in service charges on deposit accounts for can be primarily attributed to normal growth in transaction accounts and improvement in the fee structure associated with the company s deposit accounts 
recurring fee income for was million  an increase of million  or  when compared with the amounts 
this increase was attributable to the growth in service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges and fees 
this growth was principally the result of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and during  growth in our transaction accounts  an improvement in the service charge fee structure and new product offerings associated with the company s deposit accounts 
the increase from new product offerings is primarily associated with the company s overdraft protection program  which accounted for approximately half of the increase on service charges on deposit accounts for the increase in credit card fees was primarily the result of a pricing change related to interchange fees 
during the years ended december  and  combined income on the sale of mortgage loans and income on investment banking decreased  and million  respectively  from the years ended in and the decrease was primarily the result of a reduced demand for those products due to the rising interest rate environment 
premiums on sale of student loans decreased by  or  in over the decrease was due to accelerating the sale of student loans during normally  as student loans reach payout status  the company generally sells student loans into the secondary market 
because of changes in the industry in relative to loan consolidations  and in order to protect the premium on these loans  the company made the decision to sell student loans prior to the payout period 
this resulted in recognition of the premium in on loans that normally would have been sold in premiums on sale of student loans increased by  or  in over due to the accelerated sales and premium recognition during on april   the company invested an additional million in bank owned life insurance boli 
boli income increased by  in over  with the increase almost entirely attributable to this purchase 
during the second quarter of  the company sold certain available for sale investment securities obtained in a prior acquisition that did not fit our current investment portfolio strategy 
as a result of this liquidation  we recognized an after tax loss on sale of securities of  there were no gains or losses on sale of securities during  and a net loss of  in non interest expense non interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment  foreclosure losses and other expenses necessary for the operation of the company 
management remains committed to controlling the level of non interest expense  through the continued use of expense control measures that have been installed 
the company utilizes an extensive profit planning and reporting system involving all affiliates 
based on a needs assessment of the business plan for the upcoming year  monthly and annual profit plans are developed  including manpower and capital expenditure budgets 
these profit plans are subject to extensive initial reviews and monitored by management on a monthly basis 
variances from the plan are reviewed monthly and  when required  management takes corrective action intended to ensure financial goals are met 
management also regularly monitors staffing levels at each affiliate  to ensure productivity and overhead are in line with existing workload requirements 
the company closed four small financial centers during the decisions to close these financial centers were a part of on going efforts to improve the efficiency of the company s branching network  many of which were acquired through mergers and acquisitions

when normalized for both the prepayment of the trust preferred securities and the additional expenses from our expansion  non interest expense for increased by the same over the increase in credit card expense was primarily attributable the company s travel rewards program

the company has introduced several new initiatives to make our product more competitive 
the key initiative has been to move as many qualifying accounts as possible from our standard visa product to our platinum visa rewards product

the company seeks to manage its credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio  determining that borrowers have adequate sources of cash flow for loan repayment without liquidation of collateral  obtaining and monitoring collateral  providing an adequate allowance for loan losses and regularly reviewing loans through the internal loan review process 
the loan portfolio is diversified by borrower  purpose and industry and  in the case of credit card loans  which are unsecured  by geographic region 
the company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk  thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio  if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers 
collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default 
the company uses the allowance for loan losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectable amount 
loans are regularly reviewed to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits 
consumer loans consist of credit card loans  student loans and other consumer loans 
consumer loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  the million consumer loan increase from to is the result of an increase in student loans and indirect lending  offset by a million decline in credit cards 
as student loans reach payout status  the company generally sells these loans into the secondary market 
because of changes in the industry relative to loan consolidations  and in order to protect the premium  the company made the decision to sell some student loans prior to the payout period in these early sales created a decline in the portfolio balances at december  the increase in student loans from to was the result of the student loan portfolio returning to historical levels at december  the increase in the indirect consumer loan portfolio was primarily the result of more aggressive marketing efforts by the company  along with less attractive finance incentives offered by car manufacturers 
the credit card portfolio continued to decline as the result of an on going decrease in the number of cardholder accounts resulting from competitive pressure in the credit card industry 
the company continues to experience significant competitive pressure from the credit card industry 
over the previous two years  our credit card portfolio has decreased by approximately to million each year  and  as anticipated  our average credit card portfolio balance decreased by approximately million in in order to reverse this trend  we introduced several new initiatives to make the product more competitive 
as part of our retention strategy  our goal is to move as many qualifying accounts as possible from a standard visa product to a platinum visa rewards product 
the standard visa product is the one that has been primarily impacted by the competitive teaser rates 
the platinum visa rewards product is now one of the most competitive products on the market  carrying a low fixed interest rate of  and offering customers competitive rewards based on their purchases 
during  the company converted approximately  accounts  or approximately of the targeted accounts  to our platinum card 
as a result of this conversion process  we have been able to reduce the number of closed accounts 
the company received excellent publicity during in articles in the wall street journal and other newspapers throughout the country  relative to the quality of our platinum card versus the market

impaired loans include non performing loans loans past due days or more and nonaccrual loans and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing 
non performing loans are comprised of a nonaccrual loans  b loans that are contractually past due days and c other loans for which terms have been restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the subsidiary banks recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  generally  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued 
loans  excluding credit card loans  are placed on a nonaccrual basis either when there are serious doubts regarding the collectability of principal or interest  or when payment of interest or principal is days or more past due and either i not fully secured or ii not in the process of collection 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectable  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectable is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are classified as impaired when payment of interest or principal is days past due 
litigation accounts are placed on nonaccrual until such time as deemed uncollectable 
credit card loans are generally charged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds days past due  but are turned over to the credit card recovery department  to be pursued until such time as they are determined  on a case by case basis  to be uncollectable

this decrease is mainly due to the general improvement of the company s smaller commercial loan relationships  and is indicative of the overall improvement in the asset quality of the company 
in addition  workout efforts were completed in on one large catfish loan relationship 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the underlying collateral on all impaired loans and allocates specific reserves  where appropriate  in order to absorb potential losses if the collateral were ultimately foreclosed 
allowance for loan losses overview the company maintains an allowance for loan losses 
this allowance is created through charges to income and maintained at a sufficient level to absorb expected losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is determined monthly based on management s assessment of several factors such as historical loss experience based on volumes and types  reviews or evaluations of the loan portfolio and allowance for loan losses  trends in volume  maturity and composition  off balance sheet credit risk  volume and trends in delinquencies and non accruals  lending policies and procedures including those for loan losses  collections and recoveries  national and local economic trends and conditions  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the loan portfolio  the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff and other factors and trends  which will affect specific loans and categories of loans 
as the company evaluates the allowance for loan losses  it is categorized as follows specific allocations  allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation  general allocations for each major loan category and miscellaneous allocations 
specific allocations specific allocations are made when factors are present requiring a greater reserve than would be required when using the assigned risk rating allocation 
as a general rule  if a specific allocation is warranted  it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship 
the evaluation process in specific allocations for the company includes a review of appraisals or other collateral analysis 
these values are compared to the remaining outstanding principal balance 
if a loss is determined to be reasonably possible  the possible loss is identified as a specific allocation 
if the loan is not collateral dependent  the measurement of loss is based on the expected future cash flows of the loan 
allocations for classified assets with no specific allocation the company establishes allocations for loans rated watch through doubtful in accordance with the guidelines established by the regulatory agencies 
a percentage rate is applied to each category of these loan categories to determine the level of dollar allocation 
general allocations the company establishes general allocations for each major loan category 
this section also includes allocations to loans which are collectively evaluated for loss such as credit cards  one to four family owner occupied residential real estate loans and other consumer loans 
the allocations in this section are based on a historical review of loan loss experience and past due accounts 
the company gives consideration to trends  changes in loan mix  delinquencies  prior losses  and other related information 
miscellaneous allocations allowance allocations other than specific  classified and general for the company are included in the miscellaneous section 
this primarily consists of unfunded loan commitments

it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance after considering the factors noted above 
allocated allowance for loan losses the company utilizes a consistent methodology in the calculation and application of its allowance for loan losses 
because there are portions of the portfolio that have not matured to the degree necessary to obtain reliable loss statistics from which to calculate estimated losses  the unallocated portion of the allowance is an integral component of the total allowance 
although unassigned to a particular credit relationship or product segment  this portion of the allowance is vital to safeguard against the imprecision inherent when estimating credit losses 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses reflects an increase of approximately  from december   due primarily to increases in the loan portfolio 
as a general rule  the allocation in each category within the allowance reflects the overall changes in loan portfolio mix 
the company s allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december  remained relatively consistent with the allocation at december  the unallocated portion of allowance decreased  during the year ended this decrease in unallocated allowance is primarily related to increases in general allocations based on growth of the loan portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance as a percent of total loans was and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company still has some concerns over the uncertainty of the economy and the impact of pricing in the catfish and timber industries in arkansas 
in addition  the company continues to review regulatory filings and financial statements of a public utility company that was impacted by the hurricanes of august and september of based on our analysis of loans within these business sectors  we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate for the year ended december  in  management will actively monitor the status of these industries as they relate to the company s loan portfolio and make changes to the allowance for loan losses as necessary

the company s core deposits consist of all deposits excluding time deposits of  or more and brokered deposits 
as of december   core deposits comprised of the company s total deposits 
the company continually monitors the funding requirements at each affiliate bank  along with competitive interest rates in the markets it serves 
because of the company s community banking philosophy  affiliate executives in the local markets establish the interest rates offered on both core and non core deposits 
this approach ensures that the interest rates being paid are competitively priced for each particular deposit product and structured to meet the funding requirements 
the company believes it is paying a competitive rate  when compared with pricing in those markets 
the company manages its interest expense through deposit pricing and does not anticipate a significant change in total deposits 
the company believes that additional funds can be attracted and deposit growth can be accelerated through deposit pricing if it experiences increased loan demand or other liquidity needs

stock repurchase on may   the company announced the adoption by the board of directors of a repurchase program 
the program authorizes the repurchase of up to of the outstanding common stock  or  shares 
under the repurchase program  there is no time limit for the stock repurchases  nor is there a minimum number of shares the company intends to repurchase 
the company may discontinue purchases at any time that management determines additional purchases are not warranted 
the shares are to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices  through open market or unsolicited negotiated transactions  depending upon market conditions 
the company intends to use the repurchased shares to satisfy stock option exercise  payment of future stock dividends and general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   the company repurchased a total of  shares of stock with a weighted average repurchase price of per share

cash dividends the company declared cash dividends on its common stock of per share for the twelve months ended compared to per share for the twelve months ended in recent years  the company increased dividends no less than annually and presently plans to continue with this practice 
parent company liquidity the primary liquidity needs of the parent company are the payment of dividends to shareholders  the funding of debt obligations and the share repurchase plan 
the primary sources for meeting these liquidity needs are the current cash on hand at the parent company and the future dividends received from the eight affiliate banks 
payment of dividends by the eight affiliate banks is subject to various regulatory limitations 
reference is made to item a liquidity and qualitative disclosures about market risk discussion for additional information regarding the parent company s liquidity 
risk based capital the company s subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes that  as of december   the company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
as of the most recent notification from regulatory agencies  the subsidiaries were well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  the company and subsidiaries must maintain minimum total risk based  tier risk based and tier leverage ratios as set forth in the table 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the institutions categories

examples of these commitments include but are not limited to long term debt financing  operating lease obligations  unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
the company s long term debt at december   includes notes payable  fhlb long term advances and trust preferred securities  all of which the company is contractually obligated to repay in future periods 
operating lease obligations entered into by the company are generally associated with the operation of a few of the company s financial centers located throughout the state of arkansas 
the financial obligation by the company on these locations is considered immaterial due to the limited number of financial centers  which operate under an agreement of this type 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future requirements

because of the company s high level of these two intangible assets  management believes a useful calculation is tangible return on equity 
this calculation for the twelve months ended december     and  which is similar to the gaap calculation of return on average stockholders equity  is presented in table table return on tangible equity in thousands twelve months ended return on average stockholders equity a c return on tangible equity a b c d net income a amortization of intangibles  net of taxes b average stockholders equity c average goodwill and core deposits  net     d on december   the company recorded a nonrecurring  after tax charge  or a reduction in diluted earnings per share  related to the write off of deferred debt issuance cost associated with the redemption of its trust preferred securities 
during the second quarter  the company recorded a nonrecurring addition to earnings per share  resulting from the sale of its mortgage servicing portfolio 
in light of these events  management believes operating earnings earnings excluding nonrecurring items is a useful calculation in reflection the company s performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management parent company the company has leveraged its investment in subsidiary banks and depends upon the dividends paid to it  as the sole shareholder of the subsidiary banks  as a principal source of funds for dividends to shareholders  stock repurchases and debt service requirements 
at december   undivided profits of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitor these same indicators and make adjustments as needed 
at december   each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  liquidity management the objective of the company s liquidity management is to access adequate sources of funding to ensure that cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers are met in an orderly and timely manner 
sources of liquidity are managed so that reliance on any one funding source is kept to a minimum 
the company s liquidity sources are prioritized for both availability and time to activation 
the company s liquidity is a primary consideration in determining funding needs and is an integral part of asset liability management 
pricing of the liability side is a major component of interest margin and spread management 
adequate liquidity is a necessity in addressing this critical task 
there are six primary and secondary sources of liquidity available to the company 
the particular liquidity need and timeframe determine the use of these sources 
the first source of liquidity available to the company is federal funds 
federal funds  primarily from downstream correspondent banks  are available on a daily basis and are used to meet the normal fluctuations of a dynamic balance sheet 
in addition  the company and its affiliates have approximately million in federal funds lines of credit from upstream correspondent banks that can be accessed  when needed 
in order to ensure availability of these upstream funds  the company has a plan for rotating the usage of the funds among the upstream correspondent banks  thereby providing approximately million in funds on a given day 
historical monitoring of these funds has made it possible for the company to project seasonal fluctuations and structure its funding requirements on a month to month basis 
a second source of liquidity is the retail deposits available through the company s network of affiliate banks throughout arkansas 
although this method can be a somewhat more expensive alternative to supplying liquidity  this source can be used to meet intermediate term liquidity needs 
third  the company s affiliate banks have lines of credits available with the federal home loan bank 
while the company uses portions of those lines to match off longer term mortgage loans  the company also uses those lines to meet liquidity needs 
approximately million of these lines of credit are currently available  if needed 
fourth  the company uses a laddered investment portfolio that ensures there is a steady source of intermediate term liquidity 
these funds can be used to meet seasonal loan patterns and other intermediate term balance sheet fluctuations 
approximately of the investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the company also uses securities held in the securities portfolio to pledge when obtaining public funds 
the fifth source of liquidity is the ability to access large deposits from both the public and private sector to fund short term liquidity needs 
finally  the company has established a million unsecured line of credit with a major commercial bank that could be used to meet unexpected liquidity needs at both the parent company level as well as at any affiliate bank 
the company believes the various sources available are ample liquidity for short term  intermediate term and long term liquidity 
market risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk 
in asset and liability management activities  policies designed to minimize structural interest rate risk are in place 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk represents the potential impact of interest rate changes on net income and capital resulting from mismatches in repricing opportunities of assets and liabilities over a period of time 
a number of tools are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
management uses simulation models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and various balance sheet strategies on the level of the company s net income and capital 
as a means of limiting interest rate risk to an acceptable level  management may alter the mix of floating and fixed rate assets and liabilities  change pricing schedules and manage investment maturities during future security purchases 
the simulation model incorporates management s assumptions regarding the level of interest rates or balance changes for indeterminate maturity deposits for a given level of market rate changes 
these assumptions have been developed through anticipated pricing behavior 
key assumptions in the simulation models include the relative timing of prepayments  cash flows and maturities 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of a change in interest rates on net income or capital 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
the table below presents the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  this analysis is based on a point in time and may not be meaningful because assets and liabilities are categorized according to contractual maturities  repricing periods and expected cash flows rather than estimating more realistic behaviors  as is done in the simulation models 
also  this analysis does not consider subsequent changes in interest rate level or spreads between asset and liability categories
