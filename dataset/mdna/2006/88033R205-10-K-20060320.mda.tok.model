the decrease in volumes was offset by increases in price of the oil and gas sold 
the company s gas production in kansas was only for the month of january  mcf as the company s kansas gas field was sold on march  with the buyer s production being retroactive to february  the kansas gas field had produced  mcf of gas in and  mcf in gas prices received for sales of gas from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in  in  and in oil prices received for sales of oil from the swan creek field averaged per barrel in  in  and in oil prices received for sales of oil in kansas averaged per barrel in  in  and in the company s subsidiary  tpc  had pipeline transportation revenues of  in   in and  in the decreases in revenues in and from resulted primarily from the decrease in volumes of gas produced from the swan creek field 
production costs and taxes in of  have decreased from and levels of  and  respectively  primarily as a reult to the sale of the kansas gas field 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization decreased to  in from  in and  in the decrease is mainly due to depletion on the kansas properties in and due to the sale of the kansas gas field 
the company s general administrative costs of  increased slightly over levels of  but is still lower than levels of  however  it is significant to note that the general administrative costs include a  non cash charge relating to stock options granted in and  in filing fees paid to the american stock exchange due to the conversion of the company s preferred stock to common stock 
management has made a significant effort to control costs in every aspect of its operations 
some of these cost reductions include the reduction of personnel from levels and utilization of existing employees to perform drafting and file preparation services previously performed by third parties at additional cost 
interest expense for decreased significantly over and levels 
the substantial decrease is the result of the payoff in of the company s loans from bank one  na and dolphin offshore partners  na and the conversion in and of all the company s preferred stock  which was subject to mandatory redemption  into either interests in a drilling program  common stock or cash payoffs

critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold and delivered to its customers 
natural gas meters are placed at the customers location and usage is billed each month 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the customers  revenues are recognized 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and non productive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves for each cost center are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical work  day rate rentals and the costs of drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells 
costs  however  associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and gas properties 
gains or losses are recognized only upon sales or dispositions of significant amounts of oil and gas reserves representing an entire cost center 
proceeds from all other sales or dispositions are treated as reductions to capitalized costs 
the capitalized oil and gas property  less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes  if any  are generally limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying current prices in effect as of the balance sheet date with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the reserves using a discount factor of and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions  and b the cost of investments in unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized 
no ceiling write downs were recorded in  or oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company has no undeveloped  unproved properties and consequently  no such properties have been excluded from the full cost pool 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  were determined by ryder scott  lp  petroleum consultants 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures include many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to record the effects of contractual or other legal obligations on well abandonments for capping and plugging wells 
management periodically reviews the estimate of the timing of the wells closure as well as the estimated closing costs  discounted at the credit adjusted risk free rate of 
quarterly  management accretes the discount into the liability and makes other adjustments to the liability for well retirements incurred during the period 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of non monetary assets 
this statement is based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb published statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  sfas r share based payment 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date and as a consequence future employee stock option grants and other stock based compensation plans will be recorded as expense over the vesting period of the award based on their fair values at the date the stock based compensation is granted 
the cumulative effect of initially applying sfas r is to be recognized as of the required effective date using a modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method the company will recognize stock based compensation expense from july  as if the fair value based accounting method had been used to account for all outstanding unvested employee awards granted  modified or settled in prior years 
the company adopted sfas r in and recognized  in compensation expense for options granted in the company will recognize  in and in compensation expense relating to these options granted in the ultimate impact on future years results of operation and financial position will depend upon the level of stock based compensation granted in future years 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
 which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and specifically when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error correction a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
apb no 
required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have an impact on the company s financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    purchase obligations other long term liabilities   total    item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
the company did not enter into any hedging agreements in to limit exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately  at a fixed rate 
the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
