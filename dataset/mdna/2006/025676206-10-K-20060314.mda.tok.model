overview we specialize in the sale of individual annuities primarily deferred annuities and  to a lesser extent  we also sell life insurance policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  premium collections for deferred annuities are reported as deposit liabilities instead of as revenues 
sources of revenues for products accounted for as deposit liabilities are net investment income  surrender charges deducted from the account balances of policyholders in connection with withdrawals  realized gains and losses on investments and changes in fair value of derivatives 
components of expenses for products accounted for as deposit liabilities are interest credited to account balances  changes in fair value of embedded derivatives  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements  other operating costs and expenses and income taxes 
earnings from products accounted for as deposit liabilities are primarily generated from the excess of net investment income earned over the interest credited to the policyholder  or the investment spread 
in the case of index annuities  the investment spread consists of net investment income in excess of the cost of page of the options purchased to fund the index based component of the policyholder s return and amounts credited as a result of minimum guarantees 
our investment spread is summarized as follows year ended december  average yield on invested assets cost of money aggregate average net index costs for index annuities average crediting rate for fixed rate annuities annually adjustable multi year rate guaranteed investment spread aggregate index annuities fixed rate annuities annually adjustable multi year rate guaranteed the cost of money  average crediting rates and investment spreads are computed without the impact of amortization of deferred sales inducements 
see critical accounting policies deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements 
with respect to our index annuities  the cost of money includes the average crediting rate on amounts allocated to the fixed rate options  expenses we incur to fund the annual index credits and minimum guaranteed interest credited on the index business 
proceeds received upon expiration or early termination of call options purchased to fund annual index credits are recorded as part of the change in fair value of derivatives  and are largely offset by an expense for interest credited to annuity policyholder account balances 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products 
our profitability depends in large part upon the amount of assets under our management  investment spreads we earn on our policyholders account balances  our ability to manage our investment portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risks such as interest rate changes  defaults or impairment of assets  our ability to manage costs of the options purchased to fund the annual index credits on our index annuities  our ability to manage the costs of acquiring new business principally commissions to agents and first year bonuses credited to policyholders and our ability to manage our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance require us to closely monitor our accounting policies 
we have identified four critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment 
the following summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance your ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates 
valuation of investments our fixed maturity securities bonds and redeemable preferred stocks maturing more than one year after issuance and equity securities common and non redeemable preferred stocks classified as available for sale are reported at estimated fair value 
unrealized gains and losses  if any  on these securities are included directly as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of income taxes and certain page of adjustments for assumed changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements 
fair values for securities that are actively traded are determined using quoted market prices 
for fixed maturity securities that are not actively traded  fair values are estimated using price matrices developed using yield data and other factors relating to instruments or securities with similar characteristics 
the carrying amounts of all our investments are reviewed on an ongoing basis for credit deterioration 
if this review indicates a decline in fair value that is other than temporary  our carrying amount in the investment is reduced to its fair value and a specific write down is taken 
such reductions in carrying amount are recognized as realized losses and charged to earnings 
our periodic assessment of our ability to recover the amortized cost basis of investments that have materially lower quoted market prices requires a high degree of management judgment and involves uncertainty 
factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the investment is rated investment grade  whether the issuer is current on all payments and all contractual payments have been made as agreed  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery  consideration of rating agency actions  changes in cash flows of asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for securities expected to be sold  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if we do not expect the fair value of a security to recover to cost or amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale 
once an impairment charge has been recorded  we then continue to review the other than temporarily impaired securities for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis 
realized losses through a charge to earnings may be recognized in future periods should we later conclude that the decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary pursuant to our accounting policy described above 
page of at december  and  the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities and equity securities that were in an unrealized loss position were as follows december  december  number of amortized unrealized estimated number of amortized unrealized estimated positions cost losses fair value positions cost losses fair value dollars in thousands dollars in thousands fixed maturity securities available for sale united states government full faith and credit united states government sponsored agencies public utilities corporate securities redeemable preferred stocks mortgage and asset backed securities united states government and agencies non government held for investment united states government sponsored agencies equity securities  available for sale non redeemable preferred stocks common stocks page of the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at december  and  by contractual maturity  that were in an unrealized loss position are shown below

non investment grade or not rated securities represented and at december  and  respectively  of the fair value of our fixed maturity securities 
the unrealized losses on investments we owned that were non investment grade or not rated at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the unrealized losses on such securities at december  and represented and  respectively  of gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities 
at each balance sheet date  we identify invested assets which have characteristics ie significant unrealized losses compared to book value and industry trends creating uncertainty as to our future assessment of an other than temporary impairment 
we include these securities on a list which is referred to as our watch list 
we exclude from this list securities with unrealized losses which are related to market movements in interest rates and which have no factors indicating that such unrealized losses may be other than temporary 
at december   the amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities on the watch list are as follows amortized unrealized estimated maturity months below issuer cost losses fair value date amortized cost dollars in thousands ford motor co 
our analysis of ford motor co 
and its credit performance at december  is as follows ford s senior unsecured credit rating was lowered on august  due to intensified competition  high labor costs and consistently slipping market share in north america 
w e determined that an other than temporary impairment charge on these securities was not necessary as ford has strong liquidity allowing for time to correct market share losses and improve its cost structure 
the security on the watch list is current in respect to payments of principal and interest 
we have concluded that we have the intent and the ability to hold this security for a period of time sufficient to page of allow for a recovery in fair value and that there was no other than temporary impairment on this investment at december  we took write downs on certain other investments that we concluded did have an other than temporary impairment during  and of million  million and million  respectively 
following is a discussion of each security for which we have taken write downs during the years ended december   and we own common stock of ford motor company 
while we believe that ford s strategy will improve its credit quality  the common stock could remain in an unrealized loss position for a significant time period 
we wrote this security down by million in the fourth quarter of preferred plus trust lmg is a preferred stock backed by senior notes of liberty media corporation 
we wrote this security down by million during the fourth quarter of based upon an announcement by liberty media corporation s management of a change in future business strategy and the potential for share buybacks 
we sold this security subsequent to december  northwest airlines pass thru certificates class c are backed by the general credit of northwest airlines as well as the collateral from a pool of airplanes 
we wrote this security down by million during the third quarter of based upon the uncertainty regarding the recovery of all principal and interest payments subsequent to northwest airlines bankruptcy filing on september  we sold this security subsequent to december  at a value in excess of its amortized cost 
pegasus aviation a c is an asset backed security backed by leases on airplanes 
we wrote down this security during the fourth quarter of by million 
this write down resulted from changes in the amount of expected principal and interest payments on this security related to the downturn in the airline industry 
due to continuing problems in the airline industry and further deterioration in the underlying collateral  we took an additional write down of million on this security during the third quarter of pegasus a c is an asset backed security backed by leases on airplanes 
we wrote down this security during the third quarter of and the first quarter of by million and million  respectively 
these write downs resulted from changes in the amount of expected principal and interest payments on this security related to the downturn in the airline industry 
due to continuing problems in the airline industry and further deterioration in the underlying collateral  we took an additional write down of million on this security during the second quarter of diversified asset securities ii class b is a pool of asset backed securities that entitle the holders thereof to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from a specified pool of financial assets 
we wrote this security down by million during the second quarter of based upon the deterioration of the underlying collateral along with a downgrade to below investment grade on june  oakwood mortgage e class m is an asset backed security backed by installment sales contracts secured by manufactured homes and liens on real estate 
we wrote down this security by million in the third quarter of due to continuing high default rates for the manufactured housing industry causing doubt about the return of the entire principal balance 
we wrote this security down by an additional million during the fourth quarter of due to further deterioration in default rates 
we sold this security during the second quarter of as discussed below 
oakwood mortgage c class m is backed by installment sales contracts secured by manufactured homes and liens on real estate 
we wrote this security down by million in the first quarter of due to an increase in default rates and realized losses above expected levels along with a downgrade to below investment grade on march  we took an additional write down on this page of security of million in the third quarter of due to continued deterioration in default rates 
we sold this security during the second quarter of as discussed below 
in making the decisions to write down the securities described above  we considered whether the factors leading to those write downs impacted any other securities held in our portfolio 
in cases where we determined that a decline in value was related to an industry wide concern  we considered the impact of such concern on all securities we held within that industry classification 
below is a list of securities which we have sold at a loss  excluding losses arising from interest rate changes and losses deemed immaterial 
there were no material realized losses on the sales of securities during issuer amortized cost fair value realized losses months below amortized cost dollars in thousands year ended december  oakwood mortgage c class m oakwood mortgage e class m year ended december  transamerica capital calpine canada american airlines ford motor co 
juniper the decision to sell a security at a loss was concurrent with the decision that an initial or additional impairment charge was required 
accordingly  in all cases  this did not contradict our previous assertion that we had the ability and intent to hold the security until recovery in value 
each of these securities and the factors resulting in the sales of such securities are discussed individually below 
oakwood mortgage c class m and oakwood mortgage e class m are asset backed securities backed by installment sales contracts secured by manufactured homes and liens on real estate 
we wrote down oakwood mortgage e class m by million and million during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
we wrote down oakwood mortgage c class m by million and million during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
these write downs resulted from deterioration in default rates on the underlying collateral 
continued deterioration in the default rates on the underlying collateral led us to the decision that an additional impairment charge was required and concurrently we decided to sell these securities during transamerica capital was sold during to reduce our exposure to european insurance companies and not as a result of deteriorating credit quality 
calpine canada was sold during because it engaged in re financing activities that threatened its long term profitability and exacerbated its reliance on leverage 
the wholesale power market in which it was engaged was expected to be weak 
page of american airlines pass thru certificates  which were collateralized by a pool of airplanes  were sold during as a result of inadequate collateral coverage in a potential bankruptcy situation and recent changes regarding the airline s bank covenants regarding required minimum unrestricted cash balances 
ford motor co 
was determined to be an improving credit  however we decided to reduce our position in this security during to million by selling million principal amount of these securities at a loss of million 
juniper was a collateralized debt obligation backed by corporate debt obligations rated primarily below investment grade 
in the first quarter of  we wrote this security down as a result of downgrades and significant deterioration in the value of the underlying corporate debt 
continued deterioration led us to sell the security in our mortgage loans on real estate are reported at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts 
if we determine that the value of any mortgage loan is impaired  the carrying amount of the mortgage loan will be reduced to its fair value  based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
derivative instruments index products we offer a variety of index annuities with crediting strategies linked to several equity market indices  including the s p  the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq several of these products also offer a bond strategy linked to the lehman aggregate bond index or the lehman us treasury bond index 
these products allow policyholders to earn returns linked to equity or bond index appreciation without the risk of loss of their principal 
most of these products allow policyholders to transfer funds once a year among several different crediting strategies  including one or more of the index based strategies and a traditional fixed rate strategy 
substantially all of our index products require annual crediting of interest and an annual reset of the applicable index on the contract anniversary date 
the computation of the annual index credit is based upon either a one year annual point to point calculation ie  the gain in the applicable index from one anniversary date to the next anniversary date  a monthly averaging of the index during the contract year  or a one year monthly point to point calculation the net gain determined by adding the twelve monthly gains and losses in the applicable index within the one year period from one anniversary date to the next anniversary date 
the annuity contract value is equal to the premiums paid plus annual index credits based upon a percentage  known as the participation rate  of the annual appreciation based in some instances on monthly averages or monthly point to point calculations in a recognized index or benchmark 
the participation rate  which we may reset annually  generally varies among the index products from to 
some products apply an overall limit  or cap  ranging from to  on the amount of annual interest the policyholder may earn in any one contract year  and the applicable cap may also be adjusted annually subject to stated minimums 
in addition  some of the products have an asset fee ranging from to  which is deducted from the interest to be credited 
the minimum guaranteed contract values range from to of the premium collected plus interest credited on the minimum guaranteed contract value at an annual rate of to 
we purchase one year call options on the applicable indices as an investment to provide the income needed to fund the amount of the annual index credits on the index products 
new one year options are purchased at the outset of each contract year 
we budget an amount to purchase the specific options needed to fund the annual index credits  and the cost of the options represents our cost of providing the credits 
the amount we budget for the purchase of index call options is based on our interest spread targets and is comparable to the credited rates of interest we offer on fixed rate annuities 
for example  if the yield on our invested assets is and our targeted spread is  we allocate up to of the premium page of in the first year or account balance after the first year to the purchase of one year call options 
participation rates  which define the policyholder s level of participation in index gains each year  are determined by option costs 
for example  if  based on current market conditions  the amount allocated to the purchase of options is sufficient to purchase an option that will provide a return equal to of the annual gain in the applicable index  we will set the policyholder s participation rate at 
we have the ability to modify participation rates each year when a new option is purchased 
in general  if option costs increase  participation rates may be decreased  and if option costs decrease  participation rates may be increased 
we purchase call options weekly based upon new and renewing index account values during the applicable week  and the purchases are made by category according to the particular products and indices applicable to the new or renewing account values 
any proceeds received on the options at the expiration of the one year term fund the related index credits to the policyholders 
if there is no gain in an index  the policyholder receives a zero index credit on the policy  and we incur no costs beyond the option cost  except in cases where the minimum guaranteed value of a contract exceeds its index value 
fair value changes associated with the call options are reported as an increase or decrease in revenues in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the risk associated with prospective purchases of future one year options is the uncertainty of the cost  which will determine whether we are able to earn our spread on our index business 
all our index products permit us to modify participation rates  annual income caps or asset fees at least once a year 
this feature is comparable to our fixed rate annuities  which allow us to adjust crediting rates annually 
by modifying our participation rates or other features  we can limit our costs of purchasing the related one year call options  except in cases where contractual features would prevent further modifications 
based upon actuarial testing which we conduct as a part of the design of our index products and on an ongoing basis  we believe the risk that contractual features would prevent us from controlling option costs is not material 
after the purchase of the one year call options and payment of acquisition costs  we invest the balance of index premiums as a part of our general account invested assets 
with respect to the index products  our investment spread is measured as the difference between the aggregate yield on the relevant portion of our invested assets  less the aggregate option costs and the costs associated with minimum guarantees 
if the minimum guaranteed value of an index product exceeds the index value computed on a cumulative basis over the life of the contract then the general account earnings are available to satisfy the minimum guarantees 
if there were little or no gains in the entire series of one year options purchased over the expected life of an index annuity typically to years  then we would incur expenses for credited interest over and above our option costs  causing our spread to tighten and reducing our profits or potentially resulting in losses on these products 
under sfas no 
 all derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts associated with our index products are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair values and changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings 
this impacts the items of revenue and expense we report on our index business as follows we must mark to market the purchased call options we use to fund the annual index credits on our index annuities based upon quoted market prices from related counterparties 
we record the change in fair value of these options as a component of our revenues 
included within the change in fair value of the options is an element reflecting the time value of the options  which initially is their purchase cost declining to zero at the end of their one year lives 
the change in fair value of derivatives also includes proceeds received at the expiration of the one year option terms and gains or losses recognized upon early termination 
under sfas no 
 the future annual index credits on our index annuities are treated as a series of embedded derivatives over the expected life of the applicable contracts 
we are required to estimate the fair value of policy liabilities for index annuities  including the embedded derivatives  page of by valuing the host or guaranteed component of the liabilities and projecting i the expected index credits on the next policy anniversary dates and ii the net cost of annual options we will purchase in the future to fund index credits 
our estimates of the fair value of these embedded derivatives are based on assumptions related to underlying policy terms including annual participation rates  cap rates  asset fees  and minimum guarantees  index values  notional amounts  strike prices and expected lives of the policies 
the change in fair value of embedded derivatives increases with increases in volatility in the indices and interest rates 
the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives will not correspond to the change in fair value of the purchased options because the purchased options are one year options while the options valued in the fair value of embedded derivatives cover the expected life of the contracts which typically exceed years 
we adjust the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements to reflect the impact of the items discussed above 
the amounts reported with respect to our index business for sfas no 
are summarized as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands change in fair value of derivatives proceeds received at expiration or gains recognized upon early termination cost of money for index annuities change in difference between fair value and remaining option cost at beginning and end of period change in fair value of embedded derivatives index annuities related increase decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements commissions and certain other costs relating to the production of new business are not expensed when incurred but instead are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs or deferred sales inducements 
only costs which are expected to be recovered from future policy revenues and gross profits may be deferred 
deferred policy acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and certain costs of policy issuance 
deferred sales inducements consist of first year premium and interest bonuses credited to policyholder account balances 
amortization of deferred sales inducements is reported as a component of interest credited to account balances in the consolidated statements of income 
deferred policy acquisition costs totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
deferred sales inducements totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
for annuity and single premium universal life products  these costs are being amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from investments and  to a lesser extent  from surrender charges and mortality and expense margins 
current period amortization must be adjusted retrospectively if changes occur in estimates of future gross profits margins including the impact of realized investment gains and losses 
our estimates of future gross profits margins are based on actuarial assumptions related to the underlying policies terms  lives of the policies  yield on investments supporting the liabilities and level of expenses necessary to maintain the polices over their entire lives 
page of deferred income tax assets as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income  which requires management judgment 
based upon projections of future taxable income  and considering all other available evidence  management believes the realization of these assets is more likely than not and we have not recorded a valuation allowance against these assets 
results of operations for the three years ended december  annuity deposits by product type collected during  and  were as follows year ended december  product type dollars in thousands index annuities index strategies fixed strategy fixed rate annuities single year rate guaranteed multi year rate guaranteed total before coinsurance ceded coinsurance ceded net after coinsurance ceded for information related to our coinsurance agreements  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
gross annuity deposits for increased compared to  and increased in compared to  resulting from increased marketing efforts following the completion of our initial public offering ipo 
net annuity deposits after coinsurance increased during compared to  and increased during compared to  because we reduced the coinsurance percent in our coinsurance agreement with equitrust life insurance company equitrust  a subsidiary of fbl financial group  inc fbl  from in to in  and effective august   we suspended the equitrust coinsurance agreement 
net income increased to million in  and to million in  from million in the increases in net income were principally due to growth in the volume of business in force and increases in the investment spread earned on our annuity liabilities 
our net annuity liabilities after coinsurance ceded increased from billion at the beginning of to billion at the end of as set forth in a table included earlier in this item  we increased our aggregate investment spread to in compared to in and in net income in each year was also impacted by the application of sfas no 
to our index annuity business which we estimate decreased net income in by million  increased net income in by million and decreased net income in by million 
net income in was favorably impacted by realized gains on sales of investments of million net of income taxes and certain adjustments for changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements 
the comparisons of net income also reflect the impact of the consolidation of the service company 
as discussed in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  we acquired the service company on september   resulting in the consolidation of the service company as a wholly owned subsidiary page of of the company  rather than an implicit variable interest under fsp fin r prior to the acquisition  we had an implicit variable interest in the service company and we consolidated the service company under fsp fin r upon its adoption by us in the first quarter of as permitted by the fsp  we applied fsp fin r retroactive to january   the date of our original adoption of fin the consolidation of the service company reduced net income by million for the year ended december  this amount was principally due to a million distribution to the former shareholder of the service company prior to the september  acquisition and adjustments to the service company s income tax liabilities as a result of a change in its effective income tax rate upon becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the adoption of fsp fin r and consolidation of the service company as an implicit variable interest resulted in an increase in income tax expense of million during due to a change in the federal income tax status of the service company 
annuity and single premium universal life product charges surrender charges assessed against policy withdrawals and mortality and expense charges assessed against single premium universal life policyholder account balances increased to million in  and to million in  from million in withdrawals from annuity and single premium universal life policies subject to surrender charges were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the average surrender charge collected on withdrawals subject to surrender charges was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in average surrender charges collected in compared to was principally due to a higher amount of surrenders in related to products which had a market value adjustment feature which reduced the amount of surrender charges collected on these surrenders 
net investment income increased to million in and to million in from million in these increases are principally attributable to the growth in our annuity business and corresponding increases in our invested assets  offset by decreases in the average yield earned on investments 
invested assets on an amortized cost basis increased to billion at december  and to billion at december  compared to billion at december   while the average yield earned on average invested assets was  and for  and  respectively 
the declines in the yield earned on average invested assets are principally attributable to the reinvestment of net proceeds from called securities at lower yields 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
realized gains losses on investments fluctuate from year to year due to changes in the interest rate and economic environment and the timing of the sale of investments 
realized gains and losses on investments include gains and losses on the sale of securities as well as losses recognized when the fair value of a security is written down in recognition of an other than temporary impairment 
the components of realized gains losses on investments for the year ended december   and are summarized as follows page of year ended december  dollars in thousands available for sale fixed maturity securities gross realized gains gross realized losses write downs other than temporary impairments equity securities gross realized gains gross realized losses write downs other than temporary impairments see financial condition investments for additional discussion of write downs of the fair value of securities for other than temporary impairments 
change in fair value of derivatives call options purchased to fund annual index credits on index annuities was a decrease of million in  and increases of million in and million in see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products for the components of the change in fair value of derivatives 
the difference between the change in fair value of derivatives between the periods is primarily due to the performance of the indices upon which our options are based 
a substantial portion of our options are based upon the s p index with the remainder based upon other equity and bond market indices 
the range of index appreciation for options expiring during the years ended december   and is as follows year ended december  s p index point to point strategy monthly average strategy monthly point to point strategy n a n a lehman brothers us aggregate and us treasury indices actual amounts credited to policyholder account balances may be less than the index appreciation due to contractual features in the index annuity policies participation rates  caps and asset fees which allow us to manage the cost of the options purchased to fund the annual index credits 
the change in fair value of derivatives is also influenced by the aggregate cost of options purchased 
the aggregate cost of options has increased primarily due to an increased amount of index annuities in force 
the aggregate cost of options is also influenced by the amount of policyholder funds allocated to the various indices  market volatility which affects option pricing and the policy terms and historical experience which affects the strikes and caps of the options we purchase 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products 
page of interest credited to account balances increased to million in and to million in from million in the components of interest credited to account balances are summarized as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands index credits on index policies interest credited on fixed rate annuities and amounts allocated to fixed rate option and minimum guaranteed interest for index annuities amortization of deferred sales inducements the changes in index credits were attributable to changes in the appreciation of the underlying indices see discussion above under change in fair value of derivatives and the amount of funds allocated by policyholders to the respective index options 
the increases in interest credited on fixed rate annuities and amounts allocated to the fixed rate option and minimum guaranteed interest for index annuities were due to the growth in the annuity liabilities outstanding  partially offset by decreases in interest crediting rates on many of our products which we implemented in connection with our spread management process see table above for average crediting rates for fixed rate annuities 
the average amount of annuity liabilities outstanding net of annuity liabilities ceded under coinsurance agreements increased for to billion from billion in and billion in the increases in amortization of deferred sales inducements during and were principally attributable to growth in sales of premium and interest bonus products 
bonus products represented  and of our total annuity deposits during  and  respectively 
the increase in from this factor was offset by a million reduction in amortization associated with net realized capital losses during the year 
change in fair value of embedded derivatives was an increase of million during compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the change in the amount of expense recognized during  and primarily resulted from the increase or decrease in expected index credits on the next policy anniversary dates  which are related to the change in the fair value of the options acquired to fund these index credits discussed above in the change in fair value of derivatives 
in addition  the host value of the index reserve liabilities increased primarily as a result of increases in index annuity premium deposits 
see critical accounting policies derivative instruments index products 
change in fair value of embedded derivatives also increased by million in for the change in fair value of the conversion option embedded within our contingent convertible senior notes 
this option is required to be marked to market in accordance with sfas no 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
interest expense on notes payable increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible senior notes at a fixed rate of per annum during december the decrease in was principally due to a reduction in the principal amount of notes payable outstanding 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
interest expense on subordinated debentures for increased to million in from million in the comparable amount for was million 
these increases were primarily due to the issuance of additional floating rate subordinated debentures of million  million and million during  and  respectively  and changes in weighted average interest rates which were  and for  and  respectively 
the amount of subordinated debentures outstanding at december  was million compared to million at december  see financial condition liabilities 
page of interest expense on amounts due under repurchase agreements increased to million in from million in and million in the increases were principally due to increases in the borrowings outstanding which averaged million  million and million during  and  respectively and increases in the weighted average interest rates on amounts borrowed which were  and for  and  respectively 
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased to million in and to million in from million in these increases are primarily due to additional annuity deposits as discussed above 
the comparisons between years are further effected by amortization associated with net realized capital gains and losses and amortization associated with the application of sfas no 
to our index annuity business 
net realized capital gains and losses reduced amortization in by million and increased amortization in by million 
as discussed above  the application of sfas no 
to our index annuity business creates differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses from derivative instruments including the embedded derivative liabilities in our index annuity contracts 
as a result  gross profits used to compute the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are adjusted to reflect the application of sfas no 
to our index annuity business 
these gross profit adjustments reduced amortization in and and increased amortization in as follows million  million  million

financial condition investments our investment strategy is to maintain a predominantly investment grade fixed income portfolio  provide adequate liquidity to meet our cash obligations to policyholders and others and maximize current income and total investment return through active investment management 
consistent with this strategy  our investments principally consist of fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
insurance statutes regulate the type of investments that our life subsidiaries are permitted to make and limit the amount of funds that may be used for any one type of investment 
in light of these statutes and regulations and our business and investment strategy  we generally seek to invest in united states government agency securities and corporate securities rated investment grade by established nationally recognized rating organizations or in securities of comparable investment quality  if not rated 
page of we have classified a portion of our fixed maturity investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value and unrealized gains and losses  if any  on these securities net of income taxes and certain adjustments for changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements are included directly in a separate component of stockholders equity  thereby exposing stockholders equity to volatility due to changes in market interest rates and the accompanying changes in the reported value of securities classified as available for sale  with stockholders equity increasing as interest rates decline and  conversely  decreasing as interest rates rise 
investments increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  as a result of the growth in our annuity business discussed above 
at december   the fair value of our available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities was million less than the amortized cost of those investments  compared to million at december  at december   the amortized cost of our fixed maturity securities held for investment exceeded the fair value by million  compared to million at december  the increase in net unrealized investment losses at december  compared to december  was generally related to an increase in market interest rates

substantially all of our annuity products have a surrender charge feature designed to reduce the risk of early withdrawal or surrender of the policies and to compensate us for our costs if policies are withdrawn early 
notwithstanding these policy features  the withdrawal rates of policyholder funds may be affected by changes in interest rates and other factors 
as part of our investment strategy  we enter into securities repurchase agreements short term collateralized borrowings 
these borrowings are collateralized by investment securities with fair values approximately equal to the amount due 
we earn investment income on the securities purchased with these borrowings at a rate in excess of the cost of these borrowings 
such borrowings averaged million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on amounts due under repurchase agreements was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december  we issued million of contingent convertible senior notes due december  the notes are unsecured and bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  beginning june  in addition to regular interest on the notes  beginning with the six month interest period ending june   we will also pay contingent interest under certain conditions at a rate of per annum based on the average trading price of the notes during a specified period 
the notes are convertible at the holders option prior to the maturity date into cash and shares of our common stock under certain conditions 
the conversion price per share is which represents a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  in principal amount of notes 
upon conversion  we will deliver to the holder cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and will deliver shares of our common stock for the amount by which the conversion value exceeds the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted commonly referred to as net share settlement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details concerning the conversion features of the notes and the dilutive effect of the notes in our diluted earnings per share calculation 
we may redeem the notes at any time on or after december  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes on december    and and for a certain period of time following a change in control 
the redemption price or the repurchase price shall be payable in cash and equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any up to but not including the date of redemption or repurchase 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in the right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the notes effectively rank junior in the right of payment to any existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured indebtedness 
the notes are structurally subordinated to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
our subsidiary trusts have issued fixed rate and floating rate trust preferred securities and the trusts have used the proceeds from these offerings to purchase subordinated debentures from us 
we also issued subordinated debentures to the trusts in exchange for all of the common securities of each trust 
the sole assets of the trusts are the subordinated debentures and any interest accrued thereon 
the terms of the preferred securities issued by each trust parallel the terms of the subordinated debentures 
our obligations under the subordinated debentures and related agreements provide a full and unconditional guarantee of payments due under the trust preferred securities

liquidity for insurance operations our life subsidiaries generally receive adequate cash flow from premium collections and investment income to meet their obligations 
annuity and life insurance liabilities are generally long term in nature 
policyholders may  however  withdraw funds or surrender their policies  subject to surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions 
at december   approximately of our annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender  with a weighted average remaining surrender charge period of years and a weighted average surrender charge rate of 
we believe that the diversity of our investment portfolio and the concentration of investments in high quality securities provides sufficient liquidity to meet foreseeable cash requirements 
the investment portfolio at december  included billion amortized cost basis of publicly traded available for sale investment grade bonds 
although there is no present need or intent to dispose of such investments  our life subsidiaries could readily liquidate portions of their investments  if such a need arose 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion of the related interest rate risk exposure 
in addition  investments could be used to facilitate borrowings under repurchase page of agreements 
as indicated above  such borrowings have been used by american equity life from time to time to increase our return on investments 
liquidity of parent company we  as the parent company  are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries  and have no business operations 
we need liquidity primarily to service our debt  including the convertible senior notes and subordinated debentures issued to subsidiary trusts  pay operating expenses and pay dividends to stockholders 
the primary sources of funds for these payments are i investment advisory fees from our life subsidiaries  ii dividends on capital stock and surplus note interest payments from american equity life  and iii investment income on our investments 
these sources provide adequate cash flow to us to meet our current and reasonably foreseeable future obligations 
we may also obtain cash by drawing down our million revolving line of credit or by issuing debt or equity securities 
the payment of dividends or distributions  including surplus note payments  by our life subsidiaries is subject to regulation by each subsidiary s state of domicile s insurance department 
currently  american equity life may pay dividends or make other distributions without the prior approval of its state of domicile s insurance department  unless such payments  together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months  exceed the greater of american equity life s net gain from operations for the preceding calendar year  or of american equity life s statutory surplus at the preceding december for  up to approximately million can be distributed as dividends by american equity life without prior approval of the iowa insurance division 
in addition  dividends and surplus note payments may be made only out of statutory earned surplus  and all surplus note payments are subject to prior approval by regulatory authorities in the life subsidiary s state of domicile 
american equity life had approximately million of statutory earned surplus at december  the maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of an insurer s actual ability to pay such distributions  which may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations  such as the impact of such distributions on surplus  which could affect the insurer s ratings or competitive position  the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends or make other distributions 
further  state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of our life subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for their financial needs 
the transfer of funds by american equity life is also restricted by a covenant in our revolving line of credit agreement which requires american equity life to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of 
american equity life s risk based capital ratio was at december  statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted for our life subsidiaries differ in many respects from those governing the preparation of financial statements under gaap 
accordingly  statutory operating results and statutory capital and surplus may differ substantially from amounts reported in the gaap basis financial statements for comparable items 
information as to statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income for our life subsidiaries as of december  and and for the years ended december   and is included in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  we enter into financing transactions  lease agreements  or other commitments 
these commitments may obligate us to certain cash flows during future periods

new accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no

eitf provides guidance regarding the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and to equity securities accounted for under the cost method 
included in eitf is guidance on how to account for impairments that are solely due to interest rate changes  including changes resulting from increases in sector credit spreads 
this guidance was to become effective for reporting periods beginning after june  however  on september   the fasb issued a staff position that delayed the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance of eitf until additional clarifying guidance was issued 
in june  the fasb decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment  but directed the staff to issue proposed eitf issue no 
as final 
the final fsp retitled fsp fas is effective for us beginning on january  the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires expensing stock options and other share based payments and supersedes sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing proforma disclosure only 
this standard is effective for us as of january  and will apply to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or purchased after that date as well as the unvested portion of prior awards 
we will adopt the standard as of the effective date and do not believe it will have a material effect on our financial statements as the unvested portion of prior awards is immaterial 
the effect on future financial statements is undeterminable as the amount of future grants of stock awards is unknown

however  if it is impracticable to determine the effects of such changes  then other rules apply 
sfas is effective january  currently  we are not aware of any circumstances that require the application of sfas  and there is no anticipated impact on the financial statements 
in september  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants acsec issued statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts 
sop provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance contracts other than those specifically described in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale on investments 
sop defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights or coverages that occurs by exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement  or rider to a contract  or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract 
sop is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after december  retrospective application of sop to previously issued financial statements is not permitted 
we are continuing to evaluate sop but do not believe that it will have a material impact on the financial statements 
inflation inflation does not have a significant effect on our balance sheet 
we have minimal investments in property  equipment or inventories 
to the extent that interest rates may change to reflect inflation or inflation expectations  there would be an effect on our balance sheet and operations 
higher interest rates experienced in recent periods have decreased the value of our fixed maturity investments 
it is likely that declining interest rates would have the opposite effect 
it is not possible to calculate the effect such changes in interest rates  if any  have had on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to invest our available funds in a manner that will maximize shareholder value and fund future obligations to policyholders and debtors  subject to appropriate risk considerations 
we seek to meet this objective through investments that i consist predominately of investment grade fixed maturity securities  ii have projected returns which satisfy our spread targets  and iii have characteristics which support the underlying liabilities 
many of our products incorporate surrender charges  market interest rate adjustments or other features to encourage persistency 
we seek to maximize the total return on our available for sale investments through active investment management 
accordingly  we have determined that our available for sale portfolio of fixed maturity securities is available to be sold in response to i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in relative values of individual securities and asset sectors  iii changes in prepayment risks  iv changes in credit quality outlook for certain securities  v liquidity needs  and vi other factors 
we have a portfolio of held for investment securities which consists principally of long duration bonds issued by us government agencies 
these securities are purchased to secure long term yields which meet our spread targets and support the underlying liabilities 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the profitability of our products  the amount of interest we pay on our subordinated debentures  and the fair value of our investments 
our floating rate trust preferred securities issued by trusts iii  iv  vii  viii  ix  x and xi beginning on december  bear interest at the three month libor plus 
our outstanding balance of floating rate trust preferred securities was million at december  the profitability of most of our products depends on page of the spreads between interest yield on investments and rates credited on insurance liabilities 
we have the ability to adjust crediting rates participation rates  asset fees or caps for index annuities on substantially all of our annuity policies at least annually subject to minimum guaranteed values 
in addition  substantially all of our annuity products have surrender and withdrawal penalty provisions designed to encourage persistency and to help ensure targeted spreads are earned 
however  competitive factors  including the impact of the level of surrenders and withdrawals  may limit our ability to adjust or maintain crediting rates at levels necessary to avoid narrowing of spreads under certain market conditions 
a major component of our interest rate risk management program is structuring the investment portfolio with cash flow characteristics consistent with the cash flow characteristics of our insurance liabilities 
we use computer models to simulate cash flows expected from our existing business under various interest rate scenarios 
these simulations enable us to measure the potential gain or loss in fair value of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments  to evaluate the adequacy of expected cash flows from our assets to meet the expected cash requirements of our liabilities and to determine if it is necessary to lengthen or shorten the average life and duration of our investment portfolio 
the duration of a security is the time weighted present value of the security s expected cash flows and is used to measure a security s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
when the durations of assets and liabilities are similar  exposure to interest rate risk is minimized because a change in value of assets should be largely offset by a change in the value of liabilities 
if interest rates were to increase basis points from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would decrease by approximately million 
the impact on stockholders equity of such decrease net of income taxes and certain adjustments for changes in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred sales inducements would be an increase of million in the accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the computer models used to estimate the impact of a change in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions  require significant estimates and assume an immediate and parallel change in interest rates without any management of the investment portfolio in reaction to such change 
consequently  potential changes in value of our financial instruments indicated by the simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under given interest rate scenarios  and the differences may be material 
because we actively manage our investments and liabilities  our net exposure to interest rates can vary over time 
however  any such decreases in the fair value of our fixed maturity securities unless related to credit concerns of the issuer requiring recognition of an other than temporary impairment would generally be realized only if we were required to sell such securities at losses prior to the their maturity to meet our liquidity needs  which we manage using the surrender and withdrawal provisions of our annuity contracts and through other means as discussed earlier 
see financial condition liquidity for insurance operations for a further discussion of the liquidity risk 
at december   of our fixed income securities have call features and were subject to call redemption 
another will become subject to call redemption through december  during the years ended december  and  we received billion and billion  respectively  in net redemption proceeds related to the exercise of such call options 
we have reinvestment risk related to these redemptions to the extent we cannot reinvest the net proceeds in assets with credit quality and yield characteristics similar to the redeemed bonds 
such reinvestment risk typically occurs in a declining rate environment 
should rates decline to levels which tighten the spread between our average portfolio yield and average cost of interest credited on our annuity liabilities  we have the ability to reduce crediting rates on most of our annuity liabilities to maintain the spread at our targeted level 
at december   approximately of our annuity liabilities are subject to annual adjustment of the applicable crediting rates at our discretion  limited by minimum guaranteed crediting rates of to 
page of with respect to our index annuities  we purchase call options on the applicable indices to fund the annual index credits on such annuities 
these options are primarily one year instruments purchased to match the funding requirements of the underlying policies 
fair value changes associated with those investments are substantially offset by an increase or decrease in the amounts added to policyholder account balances for index products 
for the years ended december  and  the annual index credits to policyholders on their anniversaries were million and million  respectively 
proceeds received at expiration of these options related to such credits were million and million  respectively 
the difference between proceeds received at expiration of these options and index credits is primarily due to credits attributable to minimum guaranteed interest self funded by us 
within our hedging process we purchase options out of the money to the extent of anticipated minimum guaranteed interest on index policies 
on the anniversary dates of the index policies  we purchase new one year call options to fund the next annual index credits 
the risk associated with these prospective purchases is the uncertainty of the cost  which will determine whether we are able to earn our spread on our index business 
this is a risk we attempt to manage through the terms of our index annuities  which permit us to change annual participation rates  asset fees  and caps  subject to contractual features 
by modifying participation rates  asset fees or caps  we can limit option costs to budgeted amounts  except in cases where the contractual features would prevent further modifications 
based upon actuarial testing which we conduct as a part of the design of our index products and on an ongoing basis  we believe the risk that contractual features would prevent us from controlling option costs is not material
