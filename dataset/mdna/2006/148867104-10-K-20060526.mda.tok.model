competition we compete for cpg and pharmaceutical manufacturer advertising and consumer promotion budgets with a wide range of alternative media  including television  radio  print and direct mail advertising  as well as several alternative in store and point of sale programs 
our business segments compete with various traditional coupon delivery methods including free standing inserts  newspapers  direct mail  magazines and in or on product packaging  as well as other in store marketing 
table of contents companies and retail solution providers that use a variety of coupon  promotion or other advertising delivery methods 
we could experience increased competition from changes and advances in technology 
furthermore  as sales of certain grocery products  particularly in certain specialized consumer product categories  shift from traditional grocery retailers to mass merchandisers and value chains and other retail channels  our ability to reach shoppers through our existing retail network of traditional grocery stores and pharmacies may be impacted in certain consumer product categories 
we compete for advertising and promotional spending based on the efficiencies afforded by a unique kind of targeting based on consumer shopping behavior  called behavior based marketing 
our method of behavior based marketing requires an efficient network of retail point of sale systems  proprietary software and database systems that target individual consumers based on shopping behavior exhibited at the point of sale 
our competitive advantages in behavior based marketing are achieved through the number of shoppers reached through our networks  the number of household ids and associated purchase histories available in our database and our ability to deliver consumer insights and influence consumer buying behavior 
research and development our research and development efforts are generally for pilot project execution to create  test and support new applications for the catalina marketing network and health resource network  market research  software development and system upgrades 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  expenditures for research and development were million  million and million  respectively 
intellectual property we currently hold  and have applications pending for  numerous united states and foreign patents relating to our products and services including patents related to the delivery of targeted communications as well as improvements and additional inventions related to our current and contemplated businesses  programs and services 
in addition  we regard certain computer software as proprietary and subject to copyright protection 
we also hold  and have pending  numerous service marks and trademarks related to our entities  businesses  products and services that have associated goodwill in the relevant marketplace 
we believe that certain intellectual property owned or licensed by us gives us a competitive advantage in certain geographic regions in which we operate 
while we continue to pursue protection for intellectual property rights that we have developed  certain of our patents have and will expire and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional patent rights 
the expiration of a patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge may result in significant competition from third parties with respect to the covered product or service in a short period of time 
the actual protection afforded by a patent  which can vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent  the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the relevant country 
although we believe that our intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage  we believe that we are not dependent upon a single patent  or a specific series of patents  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in appropriate situations  we seek to vigorously protect our proprietary intellectual property rights 
government regulation our operations are subject to regulation in the united states and in other countries in which we do business 
we are subject to federal  state and foreign laws governing privacy and the use of consumer information collected by us 
in the united states  various federal agencies including the federal trade commission  the department of treasury s alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau and various state agencies have promulgated regulations that restrict the advertising of tobacco  dairy and alcohol beverage products 
these regulations vary from state to state and can restrict a manufacturer and or a retailer s ability to issue coupons for tobacco  dairy and alcohol beverage products 
other federal  state and foreign laws also restrict the content and sponsorship of regulated product coupons and messages 
chr operates in a highly regulated business environment 
in the united states  the food and drug administration of the department of health and human services hhs regulates the form and content of prescription drug promotions  such as the messaging distributed in patientlink 
in addition  federal privacy regulations  administered by the office of civil rights of hhs  affect the ability of chr and its retail pharmacy partners to use patient specific pharmacy information to provide customized patientlink prints 
some states have adopted  or are considering adopting  state medical privacy requirements that could be interpreted more stringently than federal medical privacy requirements 
federal antikickback requirements  administered by the hhs office of the inspector general  could be interpreted as restricting drug manufacturer sponsored programs such as patientlink 
state antikickback and consumer protection statutes could also be interpreted to impose similar restrictions 
in all jurisdictions in which cmi operates  we are also subject to the laws and regulations that govern foreign investment  foreign trade and currency exchange transactions 
these laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the united states and may limit our ability to convert foreign currency cash flows into us dollars 
furthermore  in foreign jurisdictions we are subject to laws and regulations which govern the type or design of programs that we can run on our network or the content of communications

risk factors risk factors relating to our business increased competition could reduce the demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
competition in the promotions and marketing services business is intense and includes many competitors 
we compete for cpg and pharmaceutical manufacturer advertising and consumer promotion budgets with a wide range of media including television  radio  print and direct mail advertising  as well as several alternative in store and point of sale programs 
while we believe we provide unique  cost effective targeted marketing services  there are many parameters on which a cpg manufacturer  pharmaceutical manufacturer or retailer may base its decision to allocate advertising or promotional expenditures  and there can be no assurance that our services will continue to compete effectively against other formats or that cpg and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers will continue to use our marketing services 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce sales prices of their existing products and services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing 
in addition  changes in technology may enable merchants and retail companies to implement or install their own proprietary point of sale systems or provide other solutions for the distribution of communications and messages 
see item business competition 
a shift in consumer purchasing trends for certain categories of products from traditional retail supermarkets may cause a decrease in the utilization of our services 
significant retailers including mass marketers and value chains do not use us for their marketing services for the distribution of coupons and communications 
many retailers utilize our competitors for such services and some conduct such services in house or otherwise allocate their marketing dollars to other media outlets 
mass marketers and value chains have significantly increased their presence in the grocery business and retail industry over the last several years 
many mass marketers and value chains  including wal mart  are not our clients 
as mass marketers and value chains such as wal mart increase their presence in the grocery business  the percentage of retail grocery purchases that occur in stores where our networks are installed may decrease 
the impact of the increased presence of mass marketers and value chains is particularly pronounced in certain product categories 
in addition  if consumers continue to shift to alternative shopping channels  like club stores  mass merchandisers and value chains  the ability and effectiveness of the catalina marketing network to reach retail shoppers may decline 
any such change in shopping behavior could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our business is dependent on the promotional spending of our manufacturer and retail partners  which may be effected by seasonal  economic and other factors over which we have no control 
in general  we expect our revenues to be greater during periods of increased promotional activity by manufacturers 
as a result  the pattern of promotion distribution can be irregular and may change from period to period depending on various factors  including the economy  competition  the timing of new product introductions and the timing of manufacturers promotion planning and implementation 
in addition  this pattern may be affected by seasonal factors such as holiday related promotions and annual budgeting processes affecting when our clients use promotional and consumer related expenditure budgets 
these factors  as well as the overall changes in the number of contracts we have with retailer and manufacturer clients  the timing of changes of the installed store base and access to revenue producing transactions  may impact our revenues and profits in any particular period 

table of contents our success depends on our relationships with retailers and pharmacies that provide access to consumers in their retail locations and we rely on data provided from retailers and pharmacies to trigger and report on the delivery of our services 
we depend on retail stores and pharmacies to provide access to transactions with consumers and allow us to install the catalina marketing network and health resource network on their premises 
we believe that our relationships with our current retail and pharmacy clients are strong  however  in the past  some retailers and pharmacies have required us to remove our network from their stores or negotiate significantly different or less advantageous terms in order for us to maintain networks in their stores 
should any of our significant retailers or pharmacy chains reduce in size  cease to exist  not renew our agreements  require us to remove our network equipment or negotiate terms with us which are less advantageous than our current agreements  the ability and effectiveness of the catalina marketing network or health resource network to reach retail shoppers and access transactions could be reduced and or the profitability of our operations could be reduced 
consolidations between our current retail and pharmacy network partners and companies that do not utilize our networks may decrease the installation base of our networks and reduce the utilization of our services 
internationally  certain value chains and mass marketers continue to make acquisitions in the retail industry 
further significant acquisitions and consolidations could have a material impact on our ability to maintain and expand our international operations 
in addition  we rely on data provided by our retailers and pharmacies to trigger and report on the delivery of our services on behalf of our manufacturer clients as well as provide a database to target transactions based on purchase history 
any change  interruption or inaccuracy of the data provided by our retailers and pharmacies could impact the services we offer to our clients as well as the data we utilize to report on transactions 
we may not succeed in our effort to develop new services or enter new retail channels and achieve future growth 
a key element of our growth strategy is the development and sale of new services and entry into new retail channels 
while new services are currently under development  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and market new services 
in addition  while we have dedicated significant resources to expanding our cms business into new retail channels beyond our foundation in the grocery channel  including installations in drug stores and mass merchandisers and pilot tests in convenience stores  there is no guaranty that we will be able to successfully operate in these retail channels  or that we will achieve revenue growth from these channels 
our inability or failure to enter new retail channels  devise new marketing services or to complete the development or implementation of particular services for use on a large scale  or the failure of such services to achieve market acceptance  could adversely affect our ability to achieve a significant part of our growth strategy 
the absence of such growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to retain and attract manufacturers  retailers and pharmacies  we believe that we must continue to introduce additional successful services 
the development and deployment of new services may require significant expenditures 
our proposed enhanced and expanded service offerings  including the deployment of color printers  will require significant capital expenditures 
we have announced that we are currently working on the deployment of color ink jet printers in our existing retail network in place of certain of our existing thermal black and white printers  and that we have and continue to pursue agreements to install our networks in new retail channels  including retail drug stores and mass merchandisers 
these efforts will require a substantial increase in our capital expenditures 
in addition  these efforts differ to some degree from our historical business and  as a result  carry additional risks 
the deployment of color ink jet printers in our existing retail network will require substantial expenditures to acquire and install such printers and  in some instances  will replace existing thermal black and white printers that may not have reached the end of their useful lives  which we plan to redeploy elsewhere 
color printers will require new and additional efforts and potential costs to be expended by our retailers  including the use and management of additional consumables  such as ink and non thermal paper  changes in software  hardware and wiring and other logistics steps not required by our current network of thermal black and white printers 
while we are working with epson and other vendors to try to simplify the use  servicing and supply of such printers and the required consumables  we cannot provide assurance that difficulties will not be encountered in installing  using and servicing such printers and the consumables 
in addition  while we believe the design of the printers and consumables will operate effectively and efficiently when deployed and operated in the field  due to the fact that the printers are highly customized and have not been tested in mass production  there can be no assurance that the timing of manufacture and delivery of the printers and consumables will move forward as currently planned  that the printers and consumables will operate in accordance with specifications  that we will experience operating 
table of contents reliability consistent with our current thermal black and white printers or that we will not experience a significant number of failures resulting from design  manufacture  operation or other causes 
furthermore  while we expect color printing to enhance the effectiveness of our clients marketing efforts or increase the redemption rates of incentives printed on our network  a track record verifying such goal has not yet been established 
hence  the deployment of color printers will involve the use of a substantial amount of capital with a risk that difficulties will be encountered in installing and using them and that they may not gain the acceptance we desire from retailers and our manufacturer clients 
such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the deployment and expansion of our existing networks in new retail channels and markets that we have not historically served  including the retail drug store market  will require a significant amount of capital expenditures 
manufacturer clients using our services for new retail channels may differ  to some extent  from our historical client base due to the nature and quantity of items carried in these retail channels 
while we expect the deployment of our network in new retail channels to enhance the effectiveness of our clients marketing efforts  a track record verifying such goal has not yet been established 
as a result  the deployment of our network in new retail channels will involve the use of a substantial amount of capital with a risk that it may not gain the acceptance we desire from our clients 
such result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
significant anticipated new initiatives  including the deployment of color printers  will impact our resources and management 
we have announced that we are currently working on several significant initiatives including the deployment of color printers in our cms grocery network and pursuit of new retail channels 
as a result of these initiatives  subject to the timing and success of these initiatives  we will experience an increased demand on our resources and management 
loss of data center capacity or interruption of telecommunication links could adversely affect our business 
our ability to protect our data centers against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  hurricanes or other disasters is critical to our future 
we believe we have taken reasonable precautions to protect our data centers and telecommunication links from events that could interrupt our operations 
any damage to our data centers or any failure of our telecommunications links that causes interruptions in our operations could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements  which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a breach of our network security could result in liability to us and deter customers from using our services 
our networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other disruptive problems 
any of the foregoing problems could result in liability to us  decrease the confidence of our manufacturer and retail client base and deter customers from using our services 
unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of confidential information related to our company stored in our computer systems 
eliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions  delays or cessation of service  cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the problem and divert management s attention 
we can provide no assurance that the security measures we have implemented will not be circumvented or that any failure of these measures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and retain customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to defend our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position  and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly 
we hold united states and foreign patents on various aspects of the process of promotion and communication distribution  and have applied for additional patents 
in addition  we regard certain computer software and each service application as proprietary and attempt to protect them through copyright and trade secret laws and internal non disclosure agreements and similar safeguards 
certain aspects of our services may not be adequately protected from infringement or copying 
further  there can be no assurance that our patents or trademarks would be upheld if challenged or that competitors might not develop similar or superior processes or services outside the protection of any patents issued to us 
third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents or other intellectual property rights  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
the actions we take to protect our patents and other proprietary rights may not be adequate 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights or misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of our time and resources 
any claims from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims 
see item business intellectual property 

table of contents intellectual property litigation against us could be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights 
we expect that  as we continue to expand our service offerings and the number of competitors in targeted marketing grows  we may be increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement  unfair competition and related claims against us 
third parties may also seek to invalidate certain of our patents 
in addition  competitors and third parties may  in the future  name our clients as defendants in lawsuits  which may cause these clients to terminate their relationships with us 
our efforts to defend these actions may not be successful 
our failure to prevail in this type of litigation could result in our paying monetary damages which could be tripled if the infringement is found to have been willful  an injunction requiring us to stop offering our services in their current form  our having to redesign our technology and business methods  which could be costly and time consuming  even where a redesign is feasible  or our having to pay fees to license intellectual property rights  which may result in unanticipated or higher operating costs 
any third party claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and damages  cause us to reduce or alter our services  delay or prevent service enhancements or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
legislation relating to consumer privacy and changes in government regulations could affect our ability to deliver targeted communications and collect data that we use in providing our marketing services  which could negatively affect our ability to satisfy our clients needs 
the enactment of legislation related to consumer privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on our marketing services 
any such legislation could place restrictions upon the collection and use of information that is currently legally available  which could materially increase our cost of managing or collecting some data 
legislation or industry regulation could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data  coupons  promotions  messages or newsletters  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our clients requirements 
with respect to chr s health resource network  our ability to provide consumers with condition specific health information and direct to patient communications may be adversely affected by concerns over heath regulatory guidelines and publicity regarding a patient s rights to privacy 
regulatory changes in some jurisdictions have increased manufacturer and retailer sensitivity and selectiveness as to what types of messages they will distribute in these jurisdictions 
in addition  changes in the laws and regulations or manner of enforcement of such laws and regulations could negatively impact our business and cause us to change our services or systems 
while we are currently working with our manufacturer and retailer clients to find an adequate solution to these concerns  there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to distribute prints for these clients or that there will not be additional changes in the laws and regulations in these and other jurisdictions that will further impact our operations 
see item government regulation 
compliance with changes in the securities laws and regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  is likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july the act has required changes in some of our corporate governance  securities disclosure and compliance practices 
in response to the requirements of that act  the sec and the nyse have promulgated new rules 
compliance with these new rules has increased our legal and financial and accounting costs  and we expect these increased costs to continue indefinitely 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain or obtain coverage 
in addition  these developments may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors or qualified executive officers 
due to inherent limitations  there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud  or in informing management of all material information in timely manner 
our management  including our ceo and cfo  does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the control 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
