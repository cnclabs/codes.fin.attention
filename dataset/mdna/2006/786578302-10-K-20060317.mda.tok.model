item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact made in this annual report are forward looking 
forward looking statements reflect management s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed below  and identified in item a of this annual report on form k that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
overview our primary source of revenue is the sale of our software and hardware products and consulting services combined with the resale of software applications and hardware products sourced or assembled from third parties 
for logical access control needs  we develop biometric and smart card application software  and resell 
table of contents biometric and smart card hardware and device control software from leading manufacturers 
biometric technologies automatically identify individuals by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual  such as a fingerprint  iris pattern  voiceprint or facial feature  creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic and then comparing it against a previously created and stored digital identifier 
because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics  it is both highly secure and highly convenient for the individual seeking access 
smart card solutions operate similarly for identity verification and authentication but typically are used in conjunction with a public key infrastructure pki deployment 
smart cards employing pki technology can be used for logical access decisions as well as securing electronic communications 
our software products are designed for large scale and complex computer networks  facilities  and manufacturing automation systems  and allow users seeking access or performing transactions to be identified using various biometric technologies 
our products comply with recognized industry standards  which allow us to integrate a large variety of biometric technologies within a common application environment without costly development related to each technology 
our products also provide our customers with the flexibility to deploy a mixture of different biometric technologies within their network to meet specific user and environmental requirements while providing protection against technology obsolescence since new devices can be added to  or upgraded within  the system without replacing or modifying the underlying biometric network support infrastructure 
our financial focus continues to be the growth of our top line revenue while maintaining acceptable gross margins 
we believe that our products and services are best sold through a consultative sales approach that requires experienced enterprise sales personnel  either from our resellers or direct sales staff  to pursue and manage sales opportunities over several months  and possibly beyond a year in length 
we believe our current headcount in the area of sales and marketing is sufficient for us to attain meaningful top line revenue growth in the future 
the primary challenge for management is to convert a significant sales pipeline into revenue 
we believe that we have been successful in building and managing a relatively large sales pipeline of opportunities 
however  we have not been successful in converting this pipeline into significant revenue 
some of the primary challenges that can impact our success in this area include government appropriations  general market factors influencing purchasing of computer network and security solutions  a relatively long sales cycle associated with our types of solutions and services  and the relative immaturity of the biometrics market 
our ability to translate the value proposition of our products and services into revenue will be a key factor in our ability to achieve financial and operational success 
the biometrics market is relatively immature and new to numerous potential customers in the commercial or governmental sectors 
this makes it even more important  compared to a more mature or established market  that we successfully identify the positive attributes of our solutions  and then translate those to the customers  so that they are motivated to purchase our products and services 
among the key challenges to our business is whether we can establish sales and profitability success prior to the emergence of a dominant competitor in our targeted markets 
our goal has been to grow our market share while the biometric market matures 
we believe that sales of large enterprise deployments  in the public or private sector  will be the first signs that we are beginning to achieve our goal of growth in market share 
on august   we acquired ssp litronic  which was subsequently renamed litronic  inc litronic and is our wholly owned subsidiary 
we acquired all of the outstanding shares of ssp litronic common stock in a stock for stock transaction where each outstanding share of ssp litronic common stock was converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock 
we issued  shares of our common stock in exchange for the outstanding shares of ssp litronic common stock 

table of contents litronic designs and develops innovative data and communication security solutions for both corporate and government institutions 
litronic also provides network security  desktop protection  and high assurance messaging systems for many organizations of the us government 
the primary reason we made the acquisition of ssp litronic was to help broaden our customer base and enable us to offer an integrated smart card plus biometric solution to the government and commercial sectors 
on december   we acquired certain assets and rights used in connection with the digital identity and biometric enhanced physical access security business of information systems support  inc and biometric solutions group  inc bsg 
the primary reason we made the purchase was to expand our market by entering the physical access market and to combine the physical access product into our existing logical access product 
we paid approximately million  which consisted of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we acquired certain intellectual property  tangible assets and inventory in the transaction 
we did not assume any liabilities on behalf of bsg as part of this acquisition  other than to accept assignment of a facilities lease for the offices of bsg in charleston  south carolina 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from license fees for software products  selling our manufactured hardware  reselling third party hardware and software applications  and fees for services related to these software and hardware products  including maintenance services  installation and integration consulting services 
we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized each period 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and related interpretations  including technical practice aids 
we recognize revenue from software arrangements by making a determination of the fair value of each element based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor  such as software products  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  installation  integration and or training 
in multiple element arrangements in which fair value exists for undelivered elements  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual arrangement fee is assigned to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any of the undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist  or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
we recognize revenue from biometric software and data security license fees upon delivery  net of an allowance for estimated returns  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
our judgment in determining the collectibility of amounts due from our customers impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
credit worthiness and collectibility are assessed  and when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
we also assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and use 
table of contents estimates and judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
if customers receive pilot or test versions of products  we recognize revenue from these arrangements upon customer acceptance of permanent license rights 
if our software is sold through a reseller  we recognize revenue when the reseller delivers its product to the end user 
certain software delivered under a license requires a separate annual maintenance contract that governs the conditions of post contract customer support 
post contract customer support services can be purchased under a separate contract on the same terms and at the same pricing  whether purchased at the time of sale or at a later date 
we recognize revenue from these separate maintenance support contracts ratably over the maintenance period 
if software maintenance is included under the terms of the software license agreement  then the value of such maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the initial license period 
the value of such deferred maintenance revenue is established by the price at which the customer may purchase a renewal maintenance contract 
we recognize revenue from hardware that we manufacture generally upon shipment  unless contract terms call for a later date  net of an allowance for estimated returns  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
revenue from some data security hardware products contains embedded software 
however  the embedded software is considered incidental to the hardware product sale 
we also act as a reseller of third party hardware and software applications 
generally  we recognize such revenue upon shipment of the hardware or software application  unless contract terms call for a later date  provided that all other conditions above have been met 
service revenue includes payments under support and upgrade contracts and consulting fees 
we recognize support and upgrade revenue ratably over the term of the contract  which typically is twelve months 
consulting revenue primarily relates to installation  integration and training services performed on a time and materials or fixed fee basis under separate service arrangements 
fees from consulting are recognized as services are performed 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fees are recognized separately upon delivery of the licensed software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the software product  the licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement 
if the services do include significant customization or modification of the software product or if the services are under a fixed fee contract  we recognize the revenue in accordance with the relevant guidance from the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we recognize revenue for these types of arrangements as services are rendered using the percentage of completion method with progress to complete usually measured using labor hour or labor cost inputs 
we believe that these input measures more accurately reflect our progress on projects accounted for under sop  as opposed to output measures  which are generally difficult to establish for the projects in which we are engaged 
we periodically review cost estimates on percentage of completion contracts and record adjustments in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  availability of qualified personnel and project requirement and or scope changes 
billings on uncompleted contracts may be less than or greater than the revenues recognized and are recorded as either unbilled receivable an asset or deferred revenue a liability in the consolidated financial statements 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  hardware  maintenance and professional services revenue to be recognized each period 
our revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives we use our judgment when we apply the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets is necessary 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
we have applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 since adoption on january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill relates is less than the carrying value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following poor economic performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry  economic or company specific trends  changes in the manner of its use of the assets or the plans for its business  and loss of key personnel 
if we were to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  including goodwill  based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
we also assess the impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives on at least an annual basis  or more frequently if any of the above factors exist that might cause impairment to the carrying value 
we compare the fair value of the intangible asset  which is determined based on a discounted cash flow valuation method  with the carrying value of the intangible asset 
if we were to determine that the fair value of an intangible asset was less than its carrying value  based upon the discounted cash flow valuation  we would recognize impairment loss in the amount of the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
changes to the assumptions we use to determine when an impairment test in necessary could result in an impairment charge in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we use our judgment when we apply the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test of long lived assets is necessary 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset sfas no 
 we review long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  we would recognize an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we have significant purchased intangible assets subject to amortization on its balance sheet related to developed technology 
these intangible asset values were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach that used estimated future revenues  costs and discount rates 
the useful lives of these assets were estimated using our 
table of contents own historical experience  as well as analyzing other companies in the same or related industries 
factors we used to determine appropriate estimates of useful lives include  but are not limited to  the expected use of the assets  any legal regulatory  or contractual provisions that may affect the useful lives  the effects of competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the assets 
these estimates have a significant effect on our financial statements 
changes to these estimates could significantly affect the asset values on our balance sheet and the amount of amortization that is recognized in our statement of operations 
stock based compensation we make estimates and use our judgment in determining the value of stock based compensation 
we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 issued in march  to account for our employee stock options 
under this method  compensation expense is recognized only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price on the date of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to fasb statement no 
 established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
as permitted by existing accounting standards  we elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above  and have adopted only the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 as amended 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our common stock  and expected dividends 
significant changes in these assumptions for future awards could materially impact stock based compensation expense and our results of operations 
in addition  we also use our judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
we accounted for non employee stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
valuation of outstanding warrants we make estimates and use our judgment in determining the value of outstanding warrants 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
 we classified certain warrants to purchase shares of our common stock as a liability because they contain characteristics of debt 
we value the outstanding warrants using a black scholes model and use estimates for an expected dividend yield  a risk free interest rate  and price volatility of our common stock 
each interim period and year end  as long as the warrants are outstanding and contain characteristics of debt  the warrants will be revalued and any difference from the previous valuation date will be recognized as a change in fair value of outstanding warrants in our statement of operations 
significant changes in the assumptions we use to value the outstanding warrants could materially impact our results of operations 
results of operating activities we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful basis to predict our future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties 

table of contents we review financial information on a consolidated basis and  therefore  have operated as a single segment for all periods discussed 
we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  the net loss for included an impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
also included in the results was a  charge related to the modification of our outstanding convertible note that was accounted for and recorded as a debt extinguishment 
excluding this debt extinguishment charge and impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets  the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december   was million 
the increased net loss during when compared to was primarily due to increased headcount and our assumption of leases for two additional facilities related to the litronic acquisition 
the following discussion presents certain changes in our revenue and operating expenses which have occurred between fiscal years and  and between fiscal years and  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue and cost of revenue revenue of million for the year ended december   increased compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  revenue of million came from product sales and million from services during product revenue increased  or  in  when compared to  while service revenue increased  or  product revenue consists of license fees for our software products  sales of our manufactured hardware and the reselling of third party hardware and software products and applications 
during  software license revenue increased by  hardware revenue increased by million and revenue related to third party products decreased by million 
the increase in hardware revenue was primarily due to having a full twelve months of litronic reader sales during as compared to only five months of combined operations in third party product revenue decreased in  primarily due to increased availability and lower prices for biometric fingerprint readers  which increased competition for sales of these products 
service revenue consisted of payments for maintenance and support contracts  as well as labor fees related to government and commercial projects and programs 
the service revenue increase in  when compared to  was primarily related to work performed on several government projects  primarily as a subcontractor to larger system integrators 
during  lockheed martin corporation accounted for of our revenue  which was primarily earned as a subcontractor to lockheed martin on two completed government projects  and bearingpoint  inc accounted for of our revenue  which was related to another completed government project 
sales to the government accounted for and of our revenue in and  respectively 
product cost of revenue consists of software packaging and materials  the cost of our manufactured hardware and the cost of third party hardware and software applications 
service cost of revenue consists of labor and services related to government and commercial projects and software maintenance and support 
amortization of intangible assets is related to the acquisition of patents  developed technology and customer relationships from previous business combinations 
our total cost of revenue increased to million in from million in this increase was directly related to the million increase in amortization of intangible assets related to the litronic acquisition 
gross margin percentage  excluding the effect of amortization of intangible assets  increased slightly in to  when compared to the gross margin of for 
table of contents during  software license cost of revenue decreased by  hardware cost of revenue increased by  and cost of revenue related to third party products decreased by  while service cost of revenue increased by  the increase in hardware cost of revenue is directly related to the increase in hardware revenue during gross margin on hardware revenue decreased to in from in  and was primarily related to increased obsolescence expense related to inventory that was acquired during the asset purchase from bsg in december the decrease in cost of revenue for third party products in was directly attributable to the decrease in third party product revenue during the same period 
gross margins for software  third party products and service remained relatively constant in when compared to gross margins for operating expenses operating expenses increased to million in from million in operating expenses for included an impairment loss on goodwill and intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
excluding these impairment losses  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to our assumption of leases for two new facilities and our addition of approximately new employees at the time of the litronic acquisition 
the following table provides a breakdown of the dollar and percentage changes in operating expenses from to changes in operating expenses s percent product development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment loss on goodwill  n a impairment loss on intangible assets  n a stock based compensation product development product development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  allocated occupancy costs  supplies and equipment for software developers and architects  hardware engineers  program managers and quality assurance personnel  as well as outsourced software development costs and legal administration fees associated with our intellectual property portfolio 
product development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in product development costs was primarily due to increased compensation and related benefits of million and increased occupancy costs of  both of which were primarily due to having a full twelve months of litronic operations during as compared to only five months of combined operations in legal and professional services increased  in  which was related to the outsourcing of some software development to a third party 
these increases were offset by a  decrease in other expenses which was primarily related to a decrease in research and development materials and equipment purchased during as we focused our efforts on software development 
during  our product development headcount decreased by a net employees primarily due to company reductions and general attrition 
as of december   we had employees in product development 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel  trade show  advertising and promotional expenses  allocated occupancy costs  supplies  and travel and entertainment costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in sales and marketing costs was primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefit costs of million and occupancy expenses of  both of which were primarily due to having a full twelve months of litronic operations during as compared to only five months of combined operations in legal and professional services increased  during  primarily driven by consulting related to our government sales and marketing efforts 
advertising and promotion decreased by  in  primarily due to a reduction in the number of tradeshows in which we presented our products and solutions during during  our sales and marketing headcount decreased by employees primarily due to company reductions and general attrition 
as of december   we had employees in sales and marketing 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  allocated occupancy costs and supplies for our executive  finance  legal  human resource  information technology and administrative personnel  as well as professional services fees  including legal counsel  consulting work for compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  investor relations services and tax and audit fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative costs was primarily driven by a million increase in legal and professional service fees during when compared to this increase was primarily driven by expenses related to consulting work for compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of in connection with the section requirements  our audit fees also increased substantially during in addition  legal fees related to general corporate activities and the enforcement of our intellectual property rights also increased during  as well as fees paid to members of our board of directors for their services 
also adding to the overall increase in general and administrative expense was an increase in compensation and related benefits of  an increase in depreciation expense of  and an increase in other expenses of  all of which resulted from more resources required to support the larger combined company after the litronic acquisition 
the increase in other expense was primarily due to increased corporate taxes and insurance premiums for the combined company 
during  our general and administrative headcount decreased by three employees 
as of december   we had employees in general and administrative departments 
impairment loss on goodwill we test goodwill as of november annually 
however  we concluded that the price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq capital market  was depressed long enough to constitute a triggering event under sfas no 
and accordingly  we performed an interim impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets as of september  based on the preliminary results of the impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million at september   since the carrying amount of saflink was greater than its fair value and the carrying value of our goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the impairment valuation was based on a discounted cash flow approach that used estimated future revenues and costs as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates that were used are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the business 
we finalized the test of goodwill as of september   and determined that no further adjustment to the goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   and concluded that there was no further impairment to goodwill as of that date 
impairment loss on intangible assets in february  we decided to discontinue use of two tradenames that were acquired in connection with the litronic acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of these two tradenames to be zero  and as such  recorded a 
table of contents  impairment loss on intangible assets during the first quarter of related to the impairment charge for tradenames during the first quarter  we recorded a  non cash tax benefit 
in october  in connection with the preliminary impairment results under sfas no 
 we estimated the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset tradenames to be  at september   and accordingly  recorded a  impairment loss on intangible assets during the three months ended september  related to this impairment loss on the intangible asset tradenames  we recorded a  non cash tax benefit 
upon final results of the impairment test as of september   we determined that no further adjustment to the tradenames impairment charge was necessary 
tradenames have no basis for tax purposes  but do have a book carrying value 
to the extent that we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of deferred tax liabilities related to tradenames that will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period  the deferred tax liabilities cannot be offset against deferred tax assets for purposes of determining the valuation allowance 
due to our decision to discontinue use of two tradenames and the impairment charges which reduced the carrying value of tradenames from million to  the deferred tax liability related to tradenames was also reduced by  during the twelve months ended december  stock based compensation stock based compensation is either amortized over the vesting periods of the equity instrument or expensed as incurred if no future vesting exists 
stock based compensation for was primarily related to the issuance of restricted common stock grants to certain executives in june and august  the issuance of options to purchase shares of common stock to employees at an exercise price less than fair market value  the issuance of options to purchase shares of common stock to third parties for services  modifications to outstanding option agreements  and the assumption of options to purchase common stock in connection with the litronic acquisition 
stock based compensation expense was million and  for and  respectively 
for and  million and  respectively  in stock based compensation was related to employees and classified as compensation and related benefits 
operating expenses analysis by functional activity the following table provides an analysis of the over change in total operating expenses by functional category changes in operating expenses s percent compensation and related benefits legal and professional services travel and entertainment advertising and promotion occupancy  telephone and internet depreciation amortization impairment loss on goodwill  n a impairment loss on intangible assets  n a other interest expense interest expense for and  was  and  respectively 
interest expense during and consisted of interest accrued from the financing of certain insurance policies over a nine month period 
table of contents and interest expense related to the convertible notes assumed in the litronic acquisition 
we had one convertible note outstanding with a related party as of december   with a face value of  an annual interest rate of and a maturity date of december  other income  net other income  net for and  was  and  respectively 
other income primarily consisted of interest earned on money market balances 
the increase was due to increased average cash balances and higher interest rates yields during as compared to debt extinguishment loss on convertible note to related party on december   we amended the convertible note  dated november   held by richard p 
kiphart  the co chairman and lead independent director of our board of directors 
under the terms of the note  the unpaid principal and any unpaid and accrued interest were due and payable by us on december  the amendment revised the maturity date of the note such that the unpaid principal and any unpaid and accrued interest are due and payable by us on the earlier of i december   and ii upon demand on or after the date of the closing of any strategic or financing transaction that generates at least  of additional working capital for us 
in addition  the amendment revised the conversion rate at which  under certain circumstances  the unpaid principal and any unpaid and accrued interest under the promissory note convert into shares of our common stock from to 
we applied the guidance of eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments and eitf  accounting for modifications to conversion options embedded in debt instruments and related issues and determined that the change in fair value of the conversion rate resulted in a substantial change in the terms of the convertible note and therefore determined that a debt extinguishment had occurred 
the fair value of this modification was determined by using a black scholes model immediately before and after the modification  with the following assumptions an expected dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and an estimated life of one year after the modification  the remaining contractual life of the convertible note and no estimated life prior to the modification 
the fair value of the common stock used in the calculation was  the last sale price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq capital market on december  we estimated the fair value of the modification to be  and we recorded it as a debt extinguishment loss 
this charge increased loss before income taxes 
change in fair value of outstanding warrants change in fair value of outstanding warrants for resulted in a net gain of  the litronic acquisition triggered certain redemption provisions in connection with our series a warrants 
we estimated the cash redemption value to be  as of august   the date we notified the warrant holders of the acquisition  and it is fixed as long as the warrants are outstanding or until expiration in june on august   the closing date of the litronic acquisition  these warrants were reclassified as a liability because the warrants then contained characteristics of a debt instrument 
for each interim period and year end until the warrants expire in june  the remaining outstanding warrants will be revalued and any difference from the previous valuation date will be recognized as a change in fair value of outstanding warrants and charged or credited to change in fair value of outstanding warrants 
however  at june   the estimated fair value of these warrants was below the cash redemption value of  and we consequently valued the warrants at the  cash redemption value  as was the case as of september  and december  the  gain for the twelve months ended december   represents the change in valuation from december   which was estimated to be  and the estimated value of  as of december  change in fair value of outstanding warrants for resulted in a net gain of million 
the change in fair value of outstanding warrants was related to the redemption provisions in connection with our series a 
table of contents warrants as well as warrants issued in connection with our february financing 
the majority of the non cash gain is related to warrants issued in connection with the february financing 
per the original registration rights agreement  if we did not meet certain criteria  we may have been required to pay liquidated damages to each stockholder until the applicable event was cured 
on september   we amended the registration rights agreement to substitute our cash obligation to remedy any conditions that were not met  with shares of common stock instead 
the gain of million represents the change in fair value between the initial grant date  february   and the day the registration rights agreement was amended  september  the fair value of the outstanding warrants as of september   was reclassified to equity as the registration rights amendment eliminated the debt characteristics of these warrants 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax benefit of  for compared to an income tax expense of  for during the first quarter of  we recorded a  non cash tax benefit related to the  impairment charge related to tradenames and in september  we recorded a  non cash tax benefit also related to the impairment of tradenames 
tradenames have no basis for tax purposes  but do have book carrying value 
to the extent that we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of deferred tax liabilities related to tradenames that will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period  the deferred tax liabilities cannot be offset against deferred tax assets for purposes of determining the valuation allowance 
for both and  we recorded  in income tax expense that represents the income tax effect of goodwill amortization created by the bsg acquisition in december for tax purposes the goodwill is amortized over years whereas for book purposes the goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
the effective tax rate applied to the tradenames intangible asset and goodwill amortization deductible for tax purposes was 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue and cost of revenue revenue of million for the year ended december   increased compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  revenue of million came from product sales and million from services during product revenue increased  or million  in  while service revenue increased by  or  product revenue consists of license fees for software products  sales of our manufactured hardware and the reselling of third party hardware and software applications 
the increase in product revenue was primarily due to the additional hardware and software revenue contributed by litronic  after the litronic acquisition 
during  software license revenue increased by  while the sales of our own hardware and third party hardware increased by million  the majority of which can be attributed to litronic 
also  included in product revenue is the sale of third party software applications  which was  in  compared to no sales in the service revenue increase of  in over was primarily related to work performed on several government projects  either directly through the government or as a subcontractor to a systems integrator  as well as the completion of our development project in the manufacturing automation vertical market

other income primarily consisted of interest earned on cash  money market balances and short term certificates of deposit 
the increase was due to increased cash balances during when compared to 
table of contents income tax provision we recorded a non cash income tax provision of  for the twelve months ended december  this charge is required because we have a deferred tax liability related to goodwill associated with our bsg acquisition  which is being amortized for tax purposes  but not for book purposes 
as the goodwill has an indeterminable life  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to bsg goodwill which will reverse during the net operating loss carry forward period  and thus offset deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we increase the valuation allowance with a corresponding deferred tax provision as the deferred tax liability related to bsg goodwill increases due to continued amortization of goodwill for tax purposes 
change in fair value of outstanding warrants change in fair value of outstanding warrants for the twelve months ended december   resulted in a net gain of million  while there was no change in fair value of outstanding warrants during the change in fair value of outstanding warrants was related to two separate warrant issuances that had potential cash obligations and thus giving these equity instruments debt characteristics 
the majority of the non cash gain is related to warrants issued in connection with the february financing 
per the original registration rights agreement  if we did not meet certain criteria  we may have been required to pay liquidated damages to each stockholder until the applicable event was cured 
on september   we amended the registration rights agreement to substitute our cash obligation to remedy any conditions that were not met  with shares of common stock instead 
the gain of million represents the change in fair value between the initial grant date  february   and the day the registration rights agreement was amended  september  the fair value of the outstanding warrants as of september   was reclassified to equity as the registration rights amendment eliminated the debt characteristics of these warrants 
in addition  our litronic acquisition triggered certain redemption provisions in connection with our series a warrants 
the cash redemption value was estimated to be  as of august   the date we notified the warrant holders of the acquisition  and is fixed as long as the warrants are outstanding or until expiration in june on the date of the litronic acquisition  these warrants were reclassified as a liability because the warrants then contained characteristics of a debt instrument 
each interim period and year end until the warrants expire in june  the remaining outstanding warrants will be revalued and any difference from the previous valuation date will be recognized as a change in fair value of outstanding warrants and charged or credited to change in fair value of outstanding warrants 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have been unable to generate net income from operations 
we have accumulated net losses of approximately million from our inception through december   and we have continued to accumulate net losses since december  historically  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities to investors 
we financed our operations during fiscal primarily from existing working capital at december   million in net proceeds from our private placement financing in june  and net proceeds of  from stock option exercises 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of working capital  as compared to working capital of million as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   as compared to million as of december  we invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in a money market fund with a commercial bank 
we used cash of million for operating activities in  which was million more than the amount used in operations during the increase in the use of cash was primarily due to increased headcount 
table of contents and occupancy expense related to the litronic acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities was  in  which consisted of  used for purchases of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements  which was offset by  in proceeds from the sale of equipment 
this is compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in  which consisted of cash acquired in the litronic acquisition of million  net of transaction costs   in transaction costs paid related to the bsg acquisition  and  used for purchases of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million in  compared to million in in june  we raised million in net proceeds from a private placement financing and we also received  in proceeds from stock option exercises during in february  we raised million in net proceeds through a private placement financing 
in july  through a warrant modification and subsequent exercises  we raised million in net proceeds  and throughout the year we received  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
as a result of the capital raised during  we believe that we have sufficient funds to continue our operations at current levels through september  we do not have a credit line or other borrowing facility to fund our operations 
to continue our current level of operations beyond september   we expect that we will need to seek additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or other sources of financing 
we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary additional financing  we would be required to reduce the scope of our operations  primarily through the reduction of discretionary expenses  which include personnel  benefits  marketing and other costs 
we believe that if we reduce the scope of our operations  we have the current working capital resources and the means to continue as a going concern for at least the next twelve months 
we currently occupy our headquarters in bellevue  washington under a lease that expires in june on november   we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of office space in kirkland  washington  which will become our new principal executive offices 
we are required to pay taxes  insurance  and maintenance as well as monthly rental payments 
the term of the new lease is may   through august  in addition  we lease office space in edmonton  alberta  canada for our product development team that expires in march further  we lease office space for our government sales team and professional services personnel in reston  virginia  which expires in april in connection with the bsg acquisition in december  we assumed a lease for our development group in charleston  south carolina  that expires in february and lastly  in connection with the litronic acquisition  we assumed the leases of two properties in irvine  california and reston  virginia  which expire in february and february  respectively 
the lessor for the irvine  california property is krds  inc  an entity that is majority owned by three employees of our subsidiary litronic  inc  one of whom is kris shah  the president of litronic  inc and a member of our board of directors

revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in an entity s statement of income 

table of contents we are required to adopt sfas r beginning january  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we expect the adoption will have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  this estimate is based on preliminary information available to us and could materially change based on actual facts and circumstances arising during the year ending december  item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to money market funds included in our investment portfolio 
investments in fixed rate earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk as their fair market value may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
we do not use any hedging transactions or any financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we have canadian operations whose expenses are incurred in its local currency  the canadian dollar 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains or losses will be incurred and may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall profitability 
if in and  the us dollar uniformly changed in strength by relative to the currency of the foreign operations  our operating results would likely not be significantly affected 
we have a current liability related to warrants and the value is dependent upon the market price of our common stock 
the value of these warrants is estimated using the black scholes model  which incorporates the market price of our common stock as a significant variable 
the value of these warrants was  at december   which is the cash redemption value 
as long as the warrants are outstanding  this value could fluctuate each reporting period to reflect the change in fair value of these warrants from period to period 
the value will increase if the stock price and volatility increase  and will decrease through the passage of time as the term of the warrants gets shorter  or if the stock price and volatility decrease 
however  the value cannot fall below  the cash redemption value of the warrants 
the fluctuation in value will be in the form of a gain or a loss  depending upon the estimated valuation  and will be reflected in the condensed consolidated statement of operations 
if  as of december   the closing price of our common stock would have ended higher or lower than the actual close price  our net loss would have been unaffected as the value of the warrants would not have been greater than the cash redemption value of
