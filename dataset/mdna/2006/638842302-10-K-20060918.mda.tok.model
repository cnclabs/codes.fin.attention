item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand our financial condition and results of operations for the last three fiscal years ended june  you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item in this report 
our future financial condition and results of operations will vary from our historical financial condition and results of operations described below 
you should carefully review the risks described under item a and a and elsewhere in this report  which identify certain important factors that could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to vary 
executive overview the following overview does not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of this item or other items in this report or contain all of the information that may be important to our stockholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this item and this report 
in fiscal  we achieved record breaking net sales of million and completed our fifth consecutive year of increased revenue and operating profits 
a cornerstone of our business strategy has been and will continue to be to achieve long term growth and diversify our sales 
during fiscal  we focused on the following initiatives  on which we expect to continue to focus during fiscal leveraging our state of the art  certified facilities to increase the value of the goods and services we provide to our highly valued private label contract manufacturing customers  and assist us in developing relationships with additional quality oriented customers  implementing focused initiatives to market our own branded products through rhl s distribution channels  and improving operational efficiencies and managing costs and business risks to improve profitability 
we believe our efforts to achieve long term growth and diversify our sales are beginning to be rewarded 
we have established relationships with two new customers who are leaders in the direct sales marketing channel and completed our acquisition of rhl 
we believe our acquisition of rhl marks a significant advance in our initiative to market our own branded products and expand our distribution channels and could provide the following benefits additional expertise in direct marketing and retail channels  existing leading branded products in the fdm retail channel  access to additional direct marketing and mass market channels for nai s existing products and concepts  and cost savings from integrating certain nai outsourced activities with rhl s existing operations and eliminating certain duplicative costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we integrated previously outsourced fulfillment activities for our dr 
cherry pathway to healing product line into rhl s existing operation  which should generate cost savings in future periods 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated the integration of call center activities for our dr 
cherry pathway to healing product line  which was completed in august looking forward  while there can be no assurance our new customer relationships will generate future sales or that we will realize all of the benefits we hope to realize from our rhl acquisition  we remain optimistic and expect to continue our long term trend of annual revenue growth 
however  we anticipate quarterly revenue fluctuations due to  among other things  the timing of customer orders that are impacted by marketing programs  supply chain management  entry into new markets and new product introductions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included under item in this report have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and their accompanying notes 
we have identified certain policies that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  industry standards  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an adverse effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations could occur if circumstances change that alter the various assumptions or conditions used in such estimates or assumptions 
our critical accounting policies include those listed below 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily use the discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method 
these methods require significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we are required to assess goodwill impairment annually using the methodology prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas  and emerging issues task force abstract eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
sab requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sfas states that revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product shall be recognized at the time of sale only if the seller s price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid the seller  or the buyer is obligated to pay the seller and the obligation is not contingent on 
table of contents resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to the seller would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from that provided by the seller  the seller does not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time title passes to the customer  which usually occurs upon shipment 
revenue from shipments where title passes upon delivery is deferred until the shipment has been delivered 
we account for rhl payments made to customers in accordance with eitf  which states that cash consideration including a sales incentive given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s income statement  rather than a sales and marketing expense 
rhl has various agreements with customers that provide for discounts and rebates 
these agreements are classified as a reduction of revenue 
certain other costs associated with customers that meet the requirements of eitf are recorded as sales and marketing expense 
vendor considerations recorded as a reduction of sales were  for the year ended june  rhl warrants its products for full satisfaction  generally from to days 
our policy requires us to replace the product or refund the purchase price to the customer 
at the time product revenue is recognized  we record an allowance for anticipated returns with an offsetting decrease to revenue based on historical experience 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our liability and adjust the balance as necessary 
we record reductions to gross revenue for estimated returns of private label contract manufacturing products and direct to consumer products 
the estimated returns are based upon the trailing six months of private label contract manufacturing gross sales and our historical experience for both private label contract manufacturing and direct to consumer product returns 
however  the estimate for product returns does not reflect the impact of a large product recall resulting from product nonconformance or other factors as such events are not predictable nor is the related economic impact estimable 
as part of the services we provide to our private label contract manufacturing customers  we may perform  but are not required to perform  certain research and development activities related to the development or improvement of their products 
while our customers typically do not pay directly for this service  the cost of this service is included as a component of the price we charge to manufacture and deliver their products 
inventory reserve we operate primarily as a private label contract manufacturer that builds products following receipt of customer specific purchase orders 
from time to time  we will build inventory for private label contract manufacturing customers under a specific purchase order with delivery dates that may subsequently be rescheduled or canceled at the customer s request 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on an item by item basis and establish reserves equal to all or a portion of the related inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
this requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventory  including an assessment for excess and obsolete inventory 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life and efficacy  foreseeable demand within a specified time horizon and current and expected market conditions 
based on this evaluation  we record adjustments to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory to net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or other factors differ from expectations 
as of june   we had invested approximately million in inventory following receipt of a customer s purchase order 
the delivery dates in the underlying purchase order are in the process of being rescheduled at the request of the customer 
based on our evaluation of various factors  including our discussions with the customer  the likely rescheduled delivery dates  and the remaining shelf life and efficacy of the inventory  we believe the likelihood of a charge to reduce the value of the inventory associated with the purchase order is remote 
if  however  any of the factors upon which we based our evaluation vary significantly from our expectations  the value of our inventory could be reduced by a material amount 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as property and equipment depreciation  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or results from final tax examination reviews 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would reverse the valuation allowance  which would be reflected as income tax benefit 
additionally  we have not recorded us income tax expense for naie s retained earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested in naie are based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in naie s assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of naie and nai 
income tax laws are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review several factors that influence the ultimate disposition of naie s retained earnings declared as reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  nai s actual cash needs may exceed our current expectations or naie s actual cash needs may be less than our current expectations 
additionally  changes may occur in tax laws and or accounting standards that could change our conclusion about the status of naie s retained earnings 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the fiscal year we determine that amounts are no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
it is our policy to establish reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure for certain positions taken in previously filed tax returns that may become payable upon audit by tax authorities 
the tax reserves are analyzed at least annually  generally in the fourth quarter of each year  and adjustments are made as events occur which warrant adjustments to the reserve 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the management of our foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in euros 
we may hedge our foreign currency exposures by entering into offsetting forward exchange contracts and currency options 
we account for derivative financial instruments using the deferral method under financial accounting standard  accounting for derivatives and related hedging activity fas  when such instruments are intended to hedge identifiable  firm foreign currency commitments or anticipated transactions and are designated as  and effective as  hedges 
foreign exchange exposures arising from certain transactions that do not meet the criteria for the deferral method are marked to market 
we recognize any unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative instruments in income in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is realized 
in the event the derivative instrument is deemed ineffective we would recognize the resulting gain or loss in income at that time 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of current and past due receivable balances that may not be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable and our history of bad debts 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses in the receivable balance under current conditions 
however  significant deterioration in the financial condition of our customers  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  could materially change these expectations and additional allowance may be required 
defined benefit pension plan the plan obligation and related assets of the defined benefit pension plan are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued based upon third party market quotations 
independent actuaries through the use of a number of assumptions determine plan obligation and annual pension expense 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligation include the discount rate and estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we use an average long term bond yield 
asset returns are based upon the historical returns of multiple asset classes to develop a risk free rate of return and risk premiums for each asset class 
the overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a long term inflation component  the risk free rate of return and the associated risk premium 
a weighted average rate is developed based on the overall rates and the plan s asset allocation 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to these policies

direct and indirect labor increased as a percentage of net sales from the prior year primarily due to the following private label contract manufacturing activities producing higher volumes of products with a lower average price per unit  and incurring higher outsourced packaging costs to package configurations that differ from our capabilities 
overhead expenses increased percentage points  or  from the prior year primarily due to incremental expenses related to our facility expansion in vista  california and manno  switzerland as follows rent and facility related expenses of  and depreciation and amortization expenses related primarily to our facility expansion in vista  california of  incremental freight and shipping expense of  partially offset by reduced outsourced lab testing and consulting of  in conjunction with the preparation for our tga audit in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from the prior year primarily due to the following additional rhl selling  general and administrative expenses of million  and incremental direct to consumer marketing brand development expenses of  primarily for the launch on a test basis of a new direct mail campaign featuring dr

net sales growth from nsa international  inc over the prior year resulted primarily from higher volumes of established products in existing markets 
we discontinued relationships with two of our customers due to the disproportionate risks related to inventory levels and accounts receivable required to continue serving these customers 
the remaining increase in private label contract manufacturing net sales was from growth in sales to newer customers  partially offset by decreased volumes with existing customers 
the increase in our private label contract manufacturing net sales was partially offset by the decrease in our direct to consumer net sales 
this decrease was a continuation of the decline in sales for the dr 
cherry pathway to healing product line due to our prior reduction in media spending investment in new television markets for the product line and a reduction in new customer acquisitions from our primary television market 
in addition  we terminated the chopra center essentials tm product line in june gross profit margin decreased percentage points to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to the following shift in sales mix incremental inventory reserves incremental overhead expenses reduction in royalties paid to third parties reduction in direct and indirect labor total the shift in sales mix resulted from selling higher volumes of established powder products to one of our largest customers 
powder products typically include higher material cost as a percentage of selling price compared to capsule or tablet products  resulting in lower gross profit margins  overhead expenses as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points or million  from the prior year primarily due to the following incremental outsourced lab testing of  in conjunction with the preparation for our tga audit  and incremental rent and maintenance expense of  related to our facility expansion in vista  california 
reduction in direct to consumer marketing program royalties resulted from lower net sales  and reduction in direct and indirect labor was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies and fixed cost leverage

our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the increase in our effective rate was primarily attributable to the reduction in our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in the prior year 
income taxes for fiscal differed from statutory rates primarily due to our swiss federal and cantonal income tax holiday and the utilization of certain federal and state tax credits 
our swiss tax holiday ended on june  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we repatriated million of naie s foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act the act  which was signed into law on october  the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the million repatriation resulted in an increase of  in our tax provision for fiscal naie s repatriated foreign earnings previously had been designated as permanently reinvested and the remaining undistributed retained earnings continue to be designated as such subsequent to the one time repatriation 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows provided by operating activities and the availability of borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash used in operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal at june   changes in accounts receivable  consisting primarily of amounts due from our private label contract manufacturing customers  used million in cash during fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
cash used by accounts receivable in fiscal and fiscal was due to higher annual sales of which in each year the fourth quarter represented record quarterly sales

fiscal capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of our vista  california production facility  which included the acquisition of additional manufacturing equipment 
fiscal capital expenditures included  of tenant improvements that were funded by landlord allowances 
our consolidated debt increased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to the additional million term loan obtained from our credit facility to fund  in part  the cash purchase price of the rhl acquisition  and million outstanding on our working capital line of credit for the additional investment in inventory for orders from a new private label contract manufacturing customer 
we amended our credit facility on december  and again on march  to increase our working capital line of credit from million to million  extend the maturity date and modify certain financial covenants 
the amendments included i an increase in our ratio of total liabilities tangible net worth covenant from to through june  the ratio returns to from july  through june  and to thereafter  ii a limit on capital expenditures of  for fiscal years and  iii an extension of the maturity date for the working capital line of credit from november to november  iv an increase in our ability to incur additional aggregate annual operating lease expenses from  to  without prior approval from the lender  v an increase in our ability to create specific indebtedness other than with our current lender from to  vi replacement of the ebitda coverage ratio with a fixed charge coverage ratio aggregate of net profit after taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses and net contributions aggregate current maturity of long term debt and capitalized lease payments not less than as of each fiscal quarter end  vii an increase in borrowings against eligible inventory from million to million  provided the outstanding borrowings shall not at any time exceed eligible accounts receivable  viii a change in permissible accounts receivable concentration to allow up to for a new customer acceptable to the lender  and ix a change in the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio aggregate of net profit after taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses and net contributions aggregate current maturity of long term debt and capitalized lease payments to a rolling quarter basis from each fiscal quarter end

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of the interpretation 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we may  however  enter into financial instruments to try to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict with any certainty our future exposure to fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates or other market risks or the impact  if any  such fluctuations may have on our future business  product pricing  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the actual impact of any fluctuations in interest or foreign currency exchange rates may differ significantly from those discussed below 
interest rates at june   we had fixed rate debt of  and variable rate debt of approximately million 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt range from libor plus to libor plus 
as of june   the weighted average effective interest rate on our variable rate debt was 
an immediate one hundred basis point increase in the interest rates on our variable rate debt  holding other variables constant  would have increased our interest expense by  for the fiscal year ended june  interest rates have been at or near historic lows in recent years but have been increasing during the past year 
there can be no guarantee that interest rates will not rise further 
any increase in interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
foreign currencies to the extent our business continues to expand outside the united states  an increasing share of our net sales and cost of sales will be transacted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accounting practices require that our non united states dollar denominated transactions be converted to united states dollars for reporting purposes 
consequently  our reported net income may be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

table of contents when the united states dollar strengthens against currencies in which products are sold or weakens against currencies in which we incur costs  net sales and costs could be adversely affected 
our main exchange rate exposures are with the swiss franc and the euro against the united states dollar 
this is due to naie s operations in switzerland and the payment in euros by our largest customer for finished goods

we may enter into forward exchange contracts  foreign currency borrowings and option contracts to hedge our foreign currency risk 
our goal in seeking to manage foreign currency risk is to provide reasonable certainty to the functional currency value of foreign currency cash flows and to help stabilize the value of non united states dollar denominated earnings
