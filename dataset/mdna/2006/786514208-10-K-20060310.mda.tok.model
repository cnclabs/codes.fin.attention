item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations safeway reported net income of million per diluted share in  net income of million per diluted share in and a net loss of million per diluted share in these results were significantly affected by a strike in southern california  goodwill and asset impairments at dominick s and randall s and other unusual charges described below 
strike impact on october   seven ufcw local unions struck the company s stores in southern california 
as a result  pursuant to the terms of a multi employer bargaining arrangement  kroger and albertson s locked out certain of their retail union employees in southern california food stores 
an agreement ending the strike was ratified by the union on february  employees returned to work beginning march  safeway estimates the overall cost of the strike and its residual effects reduced earnings by million before taxes per diluted share and earnings by million before taxes per diluted share 
safeway estimated the impact of the strike by comparing internal forecasts immediately before the strike with actual results during and after the strike  at strike affected stores 
the estimate also includes the company s benefit under an agreement with kroger and albertson s that arises out of the multi employer bargaining process in southern california 
dominick s pre tax charges for goodwill impairment  long lived asset impairment and store exit activities since at dominick s are summarized below in millions goodwill impairment impairment of long lived assets included in operating and administrative expense store exit activities included in operating and administrative expense in november  safeway attempted to sell dominick s and exit the chicago market due to labor issues 
in the first weeks of  safeway reduced the carrying value of dominick s by writing down million per diluted share of goodwill and million per diluted share of long lived assets  based on indications of value received during the sale process 
in november  safeway announced that it was taking dominick s off the market after the winning bidder and the unions representing dominick s could not reach an agreement on a labor contract 
safeway reclassified dominick s from an asset held for sale to assets held and used and adjusted dominick s individual long lived assets to the lower of cost or fair value 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  safeway incurred a pre tax  long lived asset impairment charge of million per diluted share and a goodwill impairment charge of million per diluted share 
as of year end  there was no goodwill remaining on safeway s consolidated balance sheet related to dominick s 
in the first quarter of  safeway closed under performing dominick s stores  which resulted in a store lease exit charge of million per diluted share 
dominick s incurred operating losses and declining sales in each of the last three fiscal years 
the company has negotiated a new labor contract at dominick s and has begun to remodel a few stores into the lifestyle format 
while management believes these transactions will improve sales and profitability  there can be no assurance that dominick s will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future

this resulted in a pre tax  long lived asset impairment charge of million per diluted share 
in the fourth quarter of  safeway recorded million pre tax per diluted share in store exit activities for these stores 
in the fourth quarter of  safeway performed its annual review of goodwill and wrote off million per diluted share of goodwill at randall s 
as a result of an improving competitive environment  the closing of under performing stores and improved marketing efforts  randall s identical store sales grew in and  although profitability improved  randall s incurred an operating loss in as previously mentioned  safeway has announced a plan to revitalize randall s  however  there can be no assurance that randall s will achieve satisfactory operating results in the future

in  safeway was notified that it was required to contribute an additional million before tax per diluted share during the year to two northern california multi employer health and welfare plans for its share of funding deficits 
on february   the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its view regarding certain lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in light of this letter  safeway determined that its then current method of accounting for rent holidays was not in accordance with gaap 
historically  the company recognized rent expense on a straight line basis beginning at the first rent payment 
the company now recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis when it takes possession and control of the property 
safeway recorded a million before tax charge per diluted share in to correct this error 
however  most of the adjustment was accumulated over many years 
in  safeway changed its accounting policy to accrue estimated physical inventory losses that occur between the last physical inventory count and the quarterly or year end balance sheet date 
previously  safeway recorded inventory losses only in the period the physical count was performed 
safeway takes a physical count of perishable inventory in stores every four weeks and nonperishable inventory in stores twice a year on a cycle basis 
distribution centers are counted twice a year on a cycle

safeway historically recorded inventory losses only in the period the physical count was performed 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  safeway determined that its then current method of accounting for estimated physical inventory losses was not in accordance with gaap 
in order to reflect inventory more accurately on the balance sheet  safeway began to accrue an estimated physical inventory loss for the period between the last physical inventory count and the quarterly or year end balance sheet date 
safeway recorded a charge of million before tax per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal to correct this error 
however  most of the adjustment accumulated over many prior years 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  safeway revised its physical inventory calculation methodology to reflect more precise data on inventory markdowns from newly installed financial software 
safeway recorded a charge of million before tax per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of this change in accounting estimate

the strike in southern california reduced gross profit by an estimated five basis points 
the remaining basis point decline was primarily the result of targeted pricing and promotion 
vendor allowances totaled billion in and billion each in and vendor allowances can be grouped into the following broad categories promotional allowances  slotting allowances and contract allowances 
all vendor allowances are classified as an element of cost of goods sold 
promotional allowances make up nearly three quarters of all allowances 
with promotional allowances  vendors pay safeway to promote their product 
the promotion may be any combination of a temporary price reduction  a feature in print ads  a feature in a safeway circular  or a preferred location in the store 
the promotions are typically one to two weeks long 
slotting allowances are a small portion of total allowances typically less than of all allowances 
with slotting allowances  the vendor reimburses safeway for the cost of placing new product on the shelf 
safeway has no obligation or commitment to keep the product on the shelf for a minimum period 
contract allowances make up the remainder of all allowances 
under the typical contract allowance  a vendor pays safeway to keep product on the shelf for a minimum period of time or when volume thresholds are achieved

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of safeway s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents safeway inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations workers compensation the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liability  as determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning workers compensation and general liability is subject to a high degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
a basis point increase in the company s discount rate would reduce its liability by approximately million 
the majority of the company s workers compensation liability is from claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business 
some of the many sources of uncertainty in the company s reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels  medical fee schedules  medical utilization guidelines  vocation rehabilitation and apportionment 
store closures safeway s policy is to recognize losses relating to the impairment of long lived assets when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying values 
when stores that are under long term leases close  safeway records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  net of estimated cost recoveries 
in both cases  fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows and discounting them using a risk adjusted rate of interest 
the company estimates future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located and  when necessary  uses real estate brokers 
however  these estimates project future cash flows several years into the future and are affected by factors such as inflation  real estate markets and economic conditions 
employee benefit plans the determination of safeway s obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent  in part  on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions are disclosed in note i to the consolidated financial statements and include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while safeway believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect safeway s pension and other post retirement obligations and its future expense 
safeway bases the discount rate on current investment yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the discount rate used to determine pension expense was 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
expected return on pension plan assets is based on historical experience of the company s portfolio and the review of projected returns by asset class on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  as well as target asset allocation 
safeway s target asset allocation mix is designed to meet the company s long term pension requirements 
for  the company s assumed rate of return was on us pension assets and on canadian pension assets 
over the year period ended december   the average rate of return was approximately for us and canadian pension assets

stock based employee compensation safeway elected to early adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on the fair value on the date of grant 
the company determines fair value of such awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
goodwill safeway accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 safeway tests for goodwill annually using a two step approach with extensive use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
the factors that most significantly affect the fair value calculation are market multiples and estimates of future cash flows 
fair value is determined by an independent third party appraiser who primarily used the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method 
income tax contingencies the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other foreign  state and local taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
loss and gain contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years

on june   the company entered into a  million credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides to safeway a  million  five year  revolving credit facility the domestic facility  to safeway and canada safeway limited csl a canadian facility of up to million for us dollar and canadian dollar advances and to safeway a million sub facility of the domestic facility for issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit 
the credit agreement also provides for an increase in the credit facility commitments up to an additional million  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the restrictive covenants of the credit agreement limit safeway with respect to  among other things  creating liens upon its assets and disposing of material amounts of assets other than in the ordinary course of business 
the credit agreement is scheduled to expire on june   it replaced the former credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in as of december   outstanding borrowings and letters of credit were million and million  respectively  under this agreement

the computation of adjusted ebitda  as defined by the credit agreement  is provided below solely to provide an understanding of the impact that adjusted ebitda has on safeway s ability to borrow under the bank credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities which are determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance or a measure of liquidity 
other companies may define adjusted ebitda differently and  as a result  such measures may not be comparable to safeway s adjusted ebitda dollars in millions

there can be no assurance  however  that safeway s business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the company will be able to maintain its ability to borrow under the commercial paper program and bank credit agreement 
on june   standard poor s s p lowered its long term credit rating on the company to bbb with a stable outlook from bbb 
moody s and fitch ratings remained unchanged at baa and bbb  respectively both with a negative outlook 
safeway s ability to borrow under the credit agreement is unaffected by safeway s credit ratings 
also  the company maintains no debt which requires accelerated repayment based on the lowering of credit ratings 
pricing under the credit agreement is generally determined by the better of safeway s interest coverage ratio or credit ratings 
safeway s pricing was unaffected by s p s lowered rating 
however  changes in the company s credit ratings may have an adverse impact on financing costs and structure in future periods  such as the ability to participate in the commercial paper market and higher interest costs on future financings 
additionally  if safeway does not maintain the financial covenants in its credit agreement  its ability to borrow under the credit agreement would be impaired 
investors should note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to withdrawal by the rating agency
