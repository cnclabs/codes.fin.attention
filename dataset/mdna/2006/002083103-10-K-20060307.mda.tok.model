item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we develop  manufacture  and market medical devices 
our primary interest lies with devices used by cardiovascular surgeons in the cardiac surgery operating theater 
currently  we participate in the markets for mechanical bileaflet replacement heart valves  allograft tissues  the surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation  and the market for surgical tools and accessories 
we also are engaged in a development project for autotransfusion products 
sulzer carbomedics carbomedics developed the basic design from which the ats heart valve evolved 
carbomedics is a large and experienced manufacturer of pyrolytic carbon components used in mechanical heart valves 
carbomedics has also designed and patented numerous mechanical valves 
in  carbomedics offered to license a patented and partially developed valve to us if we would complete the development of the valve and agree to purchase carbon components from carbomedics 
as a result  we now hold an exclusive  royalty free  worldwide license to an open pivot  bileaflet mechanical heart valve design owned by carbomedics from which the ats heart valve has evolved 
in addition  we have an exclusive  worldwide right and license to use carbomedics pyrolytic carbon technology to manufacture components for the ats heart valve 
we commenced selling the ats heart valve in international markets in in october  we received fda approval to sell the ats open pivot r mhv and commenced sales and marketing of our valve in the united states 
the original sales forecasts as well as the pricing models that were used when our original supply agreement was signed with carbomedics proved to be too optimistic 
accordingly  to keep the supply agreement active and the license to sell the valve exclusive  we purchased quantities of inventory far in excess of demand 
with inventory purchases exceeding sales through the years  we built up our inventory levels 
since  we have drawn down these paid for inventories and used the cash it generated to fund operations 
during and  we developed and implemented a plan to ramp up our own manufacturing facility for pyrolytic carbon 
by the end of  this process was substantially complete 
from through  we paid carbomedics approximately million for the development of our valve  the technology to manufacture pyrolytic carbon components  and for pyrolytic valve components manufactured by carbomedics 
by the end of  we had remaining payments due under the technology agreement that totaled million 
this led us in to negotiate an accelerated but reduced payment for all outstanding debts to carbomedics related to the technology agreement 
in we paid million to satisfy all future obligations under this agreement 
during  we reorganized the company  laying off more than half of the work force  including all executive management 
with the hiring of a new president late in  we started the process of rebuilding our sales and marketing teams  especially in the united states 
this rebuilding is the most significant factor in our operating expense levels during the last three fiscal years 
because sales prices in the united states exceed selling prices elsewhere  we feel that our future success will depend on achieving increased market share in the united states 
our us sales as a percentage of our overall sales have grown from in to in during  we made our first investments outside the mechanical heart valve market by completing two business development agreements 
the first  signed in april  was with erysave ab  a swedish research firm  for exclusive worldwide rights to erysave s parsus filtration technology for cardiac surgery procedures 
we had no revenues in nor do we expect any for from this technology 
in november  we completed a global partnership agreement with cryocath technologies  inc to market cryocath s surgical cryotherapy products for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias 
the agreement with cryocath has resulted in revenues for our company in during  we continued to develop our business outside the mechanical heart valve market by entering into two additional business development agreements 
in june  we entered into a marketing services agreement with alabama tissue center  inc atc  a k a regeneration technologies  inc 
cardiovascular  a subsidiary of regeneration technologies  inc under the terms of the agreement  atc has appointed us as its exclusive marketing services representative to promote  market and solicit orders for atc s processed cardiovascular allograft tissue from doctors  hospitals  clinics and patients throughout north america 
the agreement with atc has also resulted in revenues for our company in also in june  we entered into an exclusive development  supply and distribution agreement with genesee biomedical  inc gbi  under which gbi will develop  supply  and manufacture cardiac surgical products to include annuloplasty repair rings  c rings and accessories  and we will have exclusive worldwide rights to market and sell such products 
our agreement with gbi will produce revenues for our company in on january   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with f therapeutics  inc f 
under the terms of the merger agreement  upon closing we will pay each f stockholder its pro rata portion of an initial payment of  shares of our common stock  subject to certain post closing adjustments and a escrow fund 
we will deposit  of the shares to be delivered at closing into an escrow to be held for at least months after closing of the merger to cover indemnification claims and certain contingencies 
after expiration of the escrow  any shares remaining in the escrow will be distributed pro rata to holders of f capital stock 
in addition to the initial closing payment  we will be obligated to deliver up to an additional million shares of our common stock to f stockholders 
these additional shares will be made in two payments of up to million shares each  each of which are contingent upon ats obtaining either ce mark or fda approval for f s key products on or prior to december  these contingent payments are subject to certain rights of set off for indemnification claims and certain other events  and also may be paid in whole or in part in the event that ats engages in a sale of one or more of those key products 
the consummation of the merger with f is subject to customary conditions  and the merger agreement is subject to approval by our shareholders and the stockholders of f  however  stockholders of f holding the number of shares necessary to approve the transaction have agreed to do so 
we anticipate that the merger will close in the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and income taxes 
the critical accounting policies that are most important in fully understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy 
a significant portion of our revenue in the united states  canada  france and germany is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives 
in these situations  revenue is recognized at the time that the product has been implanted or used 
in all other instances  revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped 
certain independent distributors in select international markets receive rebates against invoiced sales amounts 
in these situations  we accrue for these rebates at the time of the original sale 
the total of these accrued rebates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated using subjective judgments and estimates to establish this valuation account 
our distribution in international markets through independent distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts 
we have successfully done business with most of these distributors for many years 
we monitor amounts that are not paid according to terms 
we attempt to accrue for potential losses due to non payment 
financial conditions in international markets can change very quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million at both december  and as a percentage of total accounts receivable  the allowance was on december  and on december  the decrease in allowance as a percent of total accounts receivable is due primarily to the legal resolution late in of a large international distributor account receivable 
inventory valuation 
inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
we have historically had manufacturing costs exceeding net realizable values in certain international markets requiring us to write down certain inventories to expected selling prices due to high purchase prices of pyrolytic valve components under our supply agreement with carbomedics 
this lower of cost or market adjustment is charged to cost of sales and is calculated by estimating future selling volume and prices by market and comparing this to actual inventory levels  both finished goods and work in process 
an adjustment is made in those cases where our manufacturing costs are or will be greater than our eventual selling price 
if our estimates of future selling prices or volumes prove incorrect  future adjustments to inventory carrying values would be necessary and could have a material impact on operations 
lower of cost or market adjustments were million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
we believe that future manufacturing costs will be lower as we manufacture our own pyrolytic carbon components 
this should decrease the risk of these adjustments as current inventories are depleted 
we maintain an obsolescence allowance against certain finished goods inventories to cover resterilization charges for expired items 
this allowance totaled million at december  and a portion of inventories on hand at december  were not likely to be sold in the following twelve month period and therefore were not classified as a current asset 
the estimate of inventories necessary to support current sales includes our projections not only of sales but inventories for new consignment accounts and contingencies  accordingly  these amounts were classified as a current asset 
intangible assets 
we assess the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the assessment of potential impairment requires certain judgments and estimates  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  risks associated with those cash flows  and the discount rate to be utilized 
as of december   we believe that the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets  specifically the carbomedics carbon technology license and the cryocath agency and distribution agreements  are recoverable and no impairment charge is currently necessary 
deferred tax assets 
we have incurred tax losses of approximately million 
the losses are carried forward for us and state corporate income taxes and can be used to reduce future taxable income 
as a result  at december  we had net deferred tax assets totaling approximately million 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against these assets because of the limited lives of the carryforwards and our lack of earnings history  which has resulted in our conclusion that it is not more than likely we will be able to utilize our loss carryforwards results of operations the following table provides the dollar and percentage change in our statements of operations for compared to and compared to increase increase decrease decrease in thousands net sales       cost of sales       gross profit      operating expenses sales and marketing       research and development     general and administrative       gain on extinguishment of debt   total operating expenses       operating loss      interest income expense net loss      the following table presents our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for   and net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses operating loss interest income expense net loss net sales 
the following table provides the dollar and percentage change in our net sales inside and outside the united states for compared to and compared to increase increase in thousands united states       outside united states       total       the following table provides our net sales inside and outside the united states as a percentage of total net sales for   and share of net sales united states outside united states total the following table provides the percentage change in average sales price  unit sales  and net sales for our mechanical heart valves inside and outside the united states for from and from average average sales unit net sales unit net price sales sales price sales sales united states outside united states total starting in the fourth quarter of and continuing through  we have been building a new sales organization in the united states  which has grown to four area directors managing more than sales territories 
our representation within these territories consists of both direct sales representatives and independent agents 
this new sales organization and overall greater sales efforts contributed to our net sales increases and to our sales within the united states 
accounting for a larger percentage of overall sales 
during the last three fiscal years  we have aggressively entered several international markets that represented opportunities for greater mechanical heart valve sales unit growth but at prices lower than our other markets 
prices in some of these territories are lower than our historical manufacturing costs 
we felt this strategy was reasonable because it allowed us to increase our market share while reducing our high priced but paid for inventories 
net sales in were also favorably impacted by revenue from the new business initiatives and partnerships discussed above  mainly revenue derived from surgical cryotherapy products and processed cardiovascular allograft tissue 
approximately of our revenue was derived from new products 
cost of goods sold and gross profit 
our costs of goods sold and gross profit as a percentage of net sales has improved over the last three years due in part to increases in our mechanical heart valve average selling prices  which are much higher in the united states than in international markets and are rising modestly 
our gross profit is anticipated to continue improving as sales within the united states 
increase as a percentage of total sales and as we start selling valves that have been entirely manufactured in our facilities 
during and  we developed and implemented a plan to ramp up our manufacturing facility for pyrolytic carbon 
by the end of  this process was substantially complete 
ramp up costs totaled approximately million and million  representing and of net sales  for and  respectively 
we have made write downs to our inventories the past three years due to future selling prices being lower than manufacturing costs in select international markets 
these write downs have declined as our high cost carbon components purchased from carbomedics have been depleted and sold  which has had favorable year to year impacts on both cost of goods sold and gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
the write downs totaled million  million  and million  representing   and of net sales for   and  respectively 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales in was also favorably impacted by revenue and gross profit from the new business initiatives and partnerships discussed above  mainly revenue derived from surgical cryotherapy products and processed cardiovascular allograft tissue 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales improved approximately over due to these new business initiatives 
the ats valve is made of materials that do not deteriorate 
other than the need to resterilize the valves periodically  there is no risk of perishability 
pyrolytic carbon  which is the substrate used in manufacturing our valves  has been the only material used to manufacture mechanical heart valves for humans for many years and remains the most advanced raw material for our products 
the other sources of prosthetic heart valves for humans are cadaver and animal tissues 
for our heart valves  however  obsolescence issues are remote due to certain advantages offered by mechanical heart valves  including superior durability 
similarly  we believe that  given the lead time that would be required  there is no material risk that there would be the introduction and fda approval of another substrate that would replace pyrolytic carbon prior to the end of the period over which we expect to sell our inventory of valves 
sales and marketing 
cost increases in over and over were for the further development of our worldwide sales and marketing organization and the substantial increase in sales and marketing personnel 
in the united states  our sales and marketing costs rose approximately in and in  to million and million  respectively 
us sales and marketing costs have risen in support of an increase in sales territories  the development of marketing programs in support of new products and services  and new marketing programs directed at increasing the us market share of our mechanical heart valves 
starting in late  we began building a sales and marketing organization that has steadily grown to more than sales territories in the united states and has a marketing department that now consists of employees 
internationally  our sales and marketing costs increased approximately in and in  to million and million  respectively 
these increases reflect our continued investment in international markets 
in  we set up direct operations in france  in  we set up infrastructure to support sales in china  and in early  we set up direct sales operations in germany 
cost increases in also included separation costs in france and increased sales management 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses include the costs to develop and improve current and future products  the costs for regulatory and clinical activities for these products  and prior to  the costs to set up and maintain our carbon components manufacturing facility while it was in a pre production mode 
the following table compares the different components of r d costs for   and year ended december  in thousands costs related to manufacturing facility  all other r d costs   total r d costs    r d expenses increased in due to costs to develop and improve current and future products and the costs for regulatory and clinical activities for these products 
the increase in r d spending also reflects staff additions as well as an increase in the number of r d programs 
the decrease in r d expenses in is attributable primarily to the plan to ramp up our pyrolytic carbon facility 
accordingly  beginning in  these costs became part of our manufacturing costs and inventories and will be expensed through cost of goods sold as products are sold 
general and administrative 
during  major cost increases in general and administrative g a expenses were for employee salary and benefits of million  non cash stock compensation and bonus expense of million  legal fees in support of business development of million  corporate insurance costs of million and outside consulting services relating primarily to board of directors fees of million 
during  we experienced costs increases of approximately million for salaries and benefits of our employees  million for corporate insurances  million for bad debt expense  and million for outside consultants and additional audit expenses to document and test internal controls in support of sarbanes oxley 
in  we granted restricted stock awards for  shares of common stock to officers and certain employees  resulting in non cash stock compensation expense charged to g a expenses of approximately million during the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which was adopted by ats on january  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock awards  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we are completing our evaluation of the methodology to use in adopting statement r 
we estimate that total stock compensation expense to be recognized under stock options and restricted stock awards outstanding at december   will be between million and million in fiscal  between million and million in fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal in december  we authorized the acceleration of vesting of all otherwise unvested stock options held by our employees with an exercise price of or greater granted under the stock incentive plan or as a free standing option not under any plan 
options to purchase  shares of common stock were subject to this acceleration 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these underwater options was made primarily to minimize future compensation expense that we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statement of operations with respect to these options pursuant to statement r 
we believe that the aggregate future expense eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options is approximately million 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
in  we entered into an agreement and paid centerpulse usa holdings co 
centerpulse million in exchange for cancellation of all of our payment obligations under our carbon technology agreement and after which we would own a fully paid exclusive license to use the carbon technology to produce components for our valve 
prior to this agreement  we were obligated to pay centerpulse an aggregate of million under the technology agreement over a period of approximately four years 
these payments were accrued as milestones were met 
of the total million  there were two uncompleted milestones totaling million that were not accrued 
since the amount accrued exceeded the amount we paid  we realized a non cash gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of million on this transaction 
net interest income expense 
in  net interest expense was attributable primarily to the october sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes  discussed further below 
interest expense on these notes in was million  which includes amortization of financing costs and the discount related to the implied value of common stock warrants sold with the notes 
in both and  interest expense was also attributable to the credit facility with silicon valley bank and the amortization of the financing costs to set up this facility 
net interest expense in was primarily attributable to the imputed interest on our long term debt previously owed to centerpulse 
interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and is attributable to the investment of our cash balances 
income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of net operating loss nol carryforwards for us tax purposes 
we believe that our ability to fully utilize the existing nol carryforwards could be restricted on a portion of the nol for changes in control that may have occurred or may occur in the future 
we have not conducted a formal study of whether a change in control of ats has occurred in the past that impairs our nol carryforwards because we are unable to utilize such nol carryforwards until we achieve profitability and because this study would be very expensive to complete 
when we attain profitability  we will conduct a formal study of any restrictions on our carryforwards 
we have not recorded any deferred tax asset related to our nol carryforwards and other deferred items as we currently cannot determine that it is more likely than not that this asset will be realized and we  therefore  have provided a valuation allowance for the entire asset 
net loss 
our net loss in  which was slightly lower than our net loss in  and the increase in net loss in compared to resulted from changes in sales offset by changes in operating costs  all of which are described above 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
operating activities 
during  we received cash payments from customers of million and made payments to employees and suppliers of million 
during  we received cash payments from customers of million and made cash payments to employees and suppliers of million 
our operating losses during the past three fiscal years were significantly funded through the depletion of inventories 
since  we incurred significant expenses commercializing the ats heart valve in the united states 
as we build sales in future periods and our cost of inventories decrease  we believe our operating losses will decrease and we will move steadily towards a cash flow breakeven on sales and eventually to profitability 
we believe our current cash balances are adequate to fund our operating activities during investing activities 
we purchased property and equipment of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
capital purchases during were mainly in support of increasing production in our pyrolytic carbon facility 
during  our spending on property and equipment should decline as a substantial portion of our purchases supported our pyrolytic carbon facility production increase efforts  which are substantially completed 
in november  we signed a global partnership agreement with cryocath technologies  inc to market cryocath s surgical cryotherapy products for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias 
for certain customers that we will market  we agreed to make a payment to cryocath representing a portion of the prior year s sales to these customers and future payments of a certain percentage of the sales occurring over the following three year period 
these payments are refundable to us upon cancellation of the agreements 
in june  the company made million in licensing fee payments to cryocath under the partnership agreement 
in april  we signed an exclusive development and licensing agreement with erysave ab and made an initial milestone payment of approximately million 
in july  we made additional milestone payments of million 
future payments under this agreement  based upon the attainment of developmental milestones  could total an additional million 
these payments are expected to occur during and in  we paid million of debt related to our technology agreement with carbomedics 
we have no future payment obligations under the technology agreement 
financing activities 
we have historically funded our operations through equity investments 
during and  we raised million and million  respectively  through private placement equity offerings  net of offering costs 
during   and  we also raised approximately million  million  and million  respectively  through the issuance of common stock through stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in july  we entered into a secured credit facility consisting of a million term note and a million line of credit 
we fully drew down the million term note  which was used to fund equipment purchases for our pyrolytic carbon facility 
the term note calls for equal installment payments over months which commenced in february accordingly  during we repaid million on the note 
under an amendment to the secured credit facility agreement effective april   we are subject to certain financial covenants  including a liquidity ratio of not less than to and a net tangible net worth of at least million through june   and million thereafter 
at december   the company was in compliance with its financial covenants 
in october  we sold a combined million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock warrants 
the warrants are exercisable at per share and expire in we plan to use these proceeds to fund business development opportunities 
the notes are convertible into common stock at any time at a fixed conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
if fully converted  the notes would convert into approximately  shares of our common stock and would require us to increase our authorized shares 
if the notes are converted under certain circumstances on or prior to october   we will pay the investors the interest they would have received on the notes through that date 
we have the right to redeem the notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest at any time on or after october   and the investors have the right to require us to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest on october in  and cash management during  we will deplete our high priced but paid for inventories of pyrolytic carbon components 
during the last two years we have increased production of these components in our own factory 
we estimate that operating costs will remain high in comparison to sales during and will require the use of cash to fund operations 
we will draw down cash balances to build inventories and fund operations during based upon the current forecast of sales and operating expenses  we anticipate having cash to fund our operations through however  as identified in item a of this form k  any adverse change that affects our revenue  access to the capital markets or future demand for our products will affect our long term viability 
maintaining adequate levels of working capital depends in part upon the success of our products in the marketplace  the relative profitability of those products and our ability to control operating and capital expenses 
funding of our operations in future periods may require additional investments in ats in the form of equity or debt 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve desired levels of sales or profitability  or that future capital infusions will be available 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions 
accordingly  we have identified in item a of this form k important risk factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our officers and agents 
we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair market value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments may be invested in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and both government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
in the united states  canada  france and germany  we sell our products directly to hospitals 
in other international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical hospitals 
loss  termination  or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
transactions with us and us customers and distributors  other than in france and germany  are entered into in us dollars  precluding the need for foreign currency hedges on such sales 
sales through our french and german subsidiaries are in euros  so we are subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
we have not used foreign exchange contract or similar devices to reduce this risk 
we will evaluate the need to use foreign exchange contracts or similar devices  if sales in france and germany increase substantially
