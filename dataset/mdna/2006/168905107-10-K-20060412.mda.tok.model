the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted as described in note retrospective application of construction period occupancy costs and the following discussion has been revised to reflect the effects of the retrospective application 
overview the children s place retail stores  inc and subsidiaries the company or we is a specialty retailer of merchandise for children from newborn to ten years of age 
we design  contract to manufacture and sell high quality  value priced apparel and accessories and other children s oriented merchandise under two brands and store concepts the children s place and disney store 
as of february   we operated the children s place stores in the united states  canada and puerto rico and disney stores in the united states and canada 
in addition  we currently operate an internet store at www 
childrensplace 
com 
during fiscal  as a result of the execution of our strategic initiatives  we achieved strong financial results 
net sales in fiscal increased million  or  to billion  compared to net sales of billion reported in fiscal during fiscal  net sales from our the children s place business increased million  an increase over fiscal in addition  net sales from our disney store business increased milion  a increase over fiscal  reflecting a full year of operations in fiscal versus weeks of operations in fiscal during fiscal  the children s place brand s comparable store sales increased compared to a increase in fiscal correspondingly  we believe our market share in children s apparel according to npd increased to in fiscal from in fiscal net income in fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal during fiscal  our strategy was to build on our progress at the children s place stores by continuing to focus on increasing store productivity and elevating our brand awareness 
we opened the children s place stores in fiscal  and closed three 
the disney store business focus in fiscal was on improving gross margin through reduced product sourcing costs and better markdown control  while providing our guest with improved merchandise quality at lower retail prices 
due to the long lead time of our merchandise purchases  we began to impact our gross margin in the back to school season 
during fiscal  we opened disney stores  remodeled disney stores  and closed seven 
as of january   consolidated merchandise inventories at cost increased by million  or approximately on a per square foot basis versus january  for the children s place  inventory at cost increased on a per square foot basis due primarily to the earlier flow of our spring inventory 
disney store inventory at cost was up approximately on a per square foot basis  reflecting our depressed levels of inventory at the end of fiscal  our planned unit increase in support of our value pricing strategy and earlier future season flows 
we expect the children s place business to end the first quarter of fiscal with inventory per square foot up approximately versus a decline last year  which reflects earlier summer and back to school flows  increased investment in summer merchandise  and increased levels of basic denim as we cycle out of our existing program and prepare for a new denim assortment 
at disney store  we expect to end the first quarter with inventory per square foot up in the low percent range  reflecting our increased investment in apparel merchandise and to support our value pricing strategy 
during the nine week period ended april   we reported total sales of million  a increase compared to sales of million during the nine week period ended april  sales for the nine week period included million from the children s place and million from disney store 
our consolidated comparable store sales increased by during the nine weeks ended april  the children s place business recorded a comparable store sales increase of  compared to a increase in the corresponding nine week period last year 
for the nine week period ended april   our disney store business recorded a comparable store sales increase of 
in february  the disney stores entered our comparable store sales base  therefore  a prior year comparable store sales figure is not available 
we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open at least months and have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
disney stores comparable stores sales results may be more volatile than those of the children s place given one time events that occur from year to year such as major theatrical movie releases or dvd releases 
retrospective application of construction period occupancy costs in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp fas no 

the fasb concluded that rental costs incurred during and after the construction period are for the right to control the use of a leased asset and must be recognized as rental expense 
these costs were previously capitalizable if a company had a policy to do so 
our policy had been to capitalize occupancy costs incurred during construction and amortize these costs over the life of the lease 
since we would have been required to expense construction period occupancy costs at the beginning of fiscal  we have retrospectively applied fsp fas no 
to consistently charge occupancy costs incurred during construction as a period expense 
the net effect of this application increases pre opening expense  which is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses  in the period we take possession of a new store  distribution center or office facility 
since these costs are no longer capitalized  the retrospective application eliminated the related depreciation expense over the lease term 
in fiscal and fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million and million  respectively 
depreciation expense decreased by million in fiscal and million in fiscal net income for fiscal and fiscal is now million  or diluted net income per share of  and million  or diluted net income per share of  respectively 
in addition to the changes in net income  adjusted net property and equipment  total assets and total stockholders equity as of january  were million  million and million  respectively 
while the retrospective application did not change our total cash position  cash flow from operations decreased in the period that occupancy costs were incurred during construction  partially offset by lower depreciation expense 
in addition  cash flows used in investing activities were lower as a result of no longer capitalizing occupancy costs during construction 
for fiscal and fiscal  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at our retail stores or when received by the customer if the product was purchased via the internet  net of coupon redemptions and anticipated sales returns 
actual sales return rates have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
however  in the event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  our operational results could be adversely affected 
our net sales include the commission we receive from a subsidiary of the walt disney company on the sale of walt disney world resort and disneyland resort tickets 
our policy with respect to gift cards is to record revenue as gift cards are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to their redemption  unredeemed gift cards for the children s place business are recorded as a liability  included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
during fiscal  we recognized million as income from gift cards that are not expected to be redeemed based upon an extended period of dormancy 
for the disney store  we act as an agent on behalf of a subsidiary of the walt disney company for gift cards sold to customers 
therefore  we do not record a customer gift card liability for the disney store 
however  we recognize a trade payable to disney for the net purchase of disney gift cards 
we offer a private label credit card to our the children s place customers that provides a discount on future purchases once a minimum annual purchase threshold has been exceeded 
we estimate the future discounts to be provided based on prior year history  the number of customers who have earned or are likely to earn the discount and current year sales trends on the private label credit card 
we defer a proportionate amount of revenue from customers based on an estimated value of future discounts 
we recognize such deferred revenue as future discounts are taken on sales above the minimum 
this is done by utilizing estimates based upon sales trends and the number of customers who have earned the discount privilege 
all deferred revenue is recognized by the end of the fiscal year 
our private label customers must earn the discount privilege on an annual basis and this privilege expires at our fiscal year end 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market  using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio by merchandise department to the retail value of inventories 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to our best estimate of their fair market value and an estimate of our inventory shrinkage 
we base our decision to mark down merchandise upon its current rate of sale  the season  and the age and sell through of the item 
to the extent that our markdown estimates are not adequate  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce our gross margins and operating results 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion taste of our customers  including the popularity and relevancy of the disney characters  and to provide a well balanced merchandise assortment that satisfies customer demand 
any inability to provide the proper quantity of appropriate merchandise in a timely manner could increase future markdown rates 
we adjust our inventory balance based on an annual physical inventory and we estimate our shrinkage rate based on the historical results of our physical inventories in consideration of current year facts and circumstances 
to the extent our shrinkage estimate is not adequate  we would be required to reduce our gross profits and operating results 
accounting for royalties in exchange for the right to use certain disney intellectual property  we are required to pay a disney subsidiary royalty payments pursuant to a license and conduct of business agreement the license agreement 
minimum royalty commitments are recorded on a straight line basis over the life of the initial year term of the license agreement 
during each period  amounts due in excess of the minimum royalty commitment are recorded as an expense if we expect to surpass the minimum royalty commitment on an annual basis  even if the contingency threshold has not been surpassed in that particular period 
we were granted a royalty holiday for all stores until november in addition  depending on the specific store location  certain stores have an extension of the royalty holiday for up to eight years from the date of the license agreement 
the actual value of the royalty holiday is not determinable until the completion of the royalty holiday period  and may differ materially from our current estimate 
estimates for the royalty holiday are adjusted on a periodic basis  and the cumulative adjustment is recorded in such period 
the amortization of the estimated value of the royalty holiday is recognized on a straight line basis as a reduction of royalty expense over the term of the license agreement 
royalty expense  and the associated amortization of the royalty holiday  is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the royalty percentage does not increase over the term of the license agreement 
we expect to pay a royalty on internet sales  and in some instances  
in fiscal  we expect net royalty expense to approximate of disney store net sales 
insurance and self insurance liabilities based on our assessment of risk and cost efficiency  we self insure and purchase insurance policies to provide for workers compensation  general liability  and property losses  as well as director s and officer s liability  vehicle liability and employee medical benefits 
we estimate risks and record a liability based upon historical claim experience  insurance deductibles  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our risk assessments are appropriate  to the extent that future occurrences and claims differ from our historical experience  additional charges for insurance may be recorded in future periods 
accounting for acquisitions the acquisition of the dsna business was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
as such  we analyzed the fair value of identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and determined the excess of fair value of net assets acquired over cost 
this excess was recorded as an extraordinary gain in fiscal and fiscal stock options historically  we have not recorded compensation expense for stock based compensation since we grant stock options at prices that equal or exceed the fair market value of our common stock at the date of the grant 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will be required to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the stock based compensation granted to employees  recognized ratably over the vesting period 
in fiscal  to minimize the impact of past option grants on future operating results  we accelerated the vesting of approximately million stock options and recorded a share based compensation charge of million  which represented our estimate of intrinsic value that would have been forfeited had we not accelerated option vesting 
reflecting prior option grants and expected fiscal equity grants  in fiscal  we anticipate that shared based compensation expense will approximate million  assuming achievement of certain performance based equity awards 
impairment of assets we periodically evaluate each store s performance and measure the carrying value of each location s fixed assets  principally leasehold improvements and fixtures  versus its projected cash flows 
an impairment loss is recorded if the projected future cash flows are insufficient to recapture the net book value of their assets 
to the extent our estimates of future cash flows are incorrect  additional impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  selected income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income before income taxes and extraordinary gain provision for income taxes income before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain  net of taxes net income number of stores  end of period year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales increased million  or  to billion during fiscal from billion during fiscal sales for fiscal were comprised of billion from the children s place business  an increase over the million reported in fiscal and million in sales from the disney store business  a increase over the million reported in fiscal disney store results in fiscal reflect a full year of operation versus weeks of operations in fiscal our fiscal net sales increase resulted from million in net sales from new stores and other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores and million in net sales from comparable stores 
we define comparable store sales as net sales from stores that have been open at least full months and that have not been substantially remodeled during that time 
comparable store sales increased as compared to a comparable store sales increase in fiscal during fiscal  our comparable store sales increase was the result of a increase in our average dollar transaction size and a increase in the number of comparable store sales transactions 
due to the acquisition of the dsna business in fiscal  the disney store business did not have any comparable stores in fiscal disney stores entered our comparable store base in february during fiscal  we achieved comparable store sales increases across all geographical regions  departments  and store types in the children s place business 
our west  southwest  southeast  and canadian regions reported the strongest comparable store sales increases 
by department  our comparable store sales increases were in line with the chain average  except for our newborn department  which reported a low single digit comparable store sales increase 
during fiscal  we opened the children s place stores  in the united states  in canada and four in puerto rico 
we also opened disney stores  in the united states and two in canada 
we closed three the children s place stores and seven disney stores in fiscal consolidated gross profit increased by million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to during fiscal from during fiscal this increase in gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was comprised primarily of a higher merchandise margin of of net sales and the impact of the sell through of acquired disney store inventory  which was favorable to fiscal by of net sales  partially offset by higher distribution and occupancy costs of of net sales due to costs associated with our new distribution center facility 
during fiscal  the sell through of acquired disney store inventory unfavorably impacted gross margin by million  or of net sales  as compared to an unfavorable impact of million  or of net sales during fiscal in accounting for the acquisition of the dsna business  we were required to write up acquired inventory to its fair value from the value determined under the retail inventory method 
for the children s place business  our gross margin was higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to a higher initial markup  lower markdowns and the leveraging of occupancy expenses  partially offset by higher distribution costs 
while disney store continues to have a lower gross margin structure than the children s place business  it has benefited from improved markdown performance and the implementation of our low cost sourcing strategies 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales during fiscal from of net sales during fiscal this increase  as a percentage of net sales  was due primarily to disney store expenses that we did not have last year such as royalty expense  which was million higher than last year  and remodel expenses 
in addition  higher repair  maintenance and utility expense  and higher payroll expense  partially offset by favorable medical costs  contributed to the increase as a percentage of sales 
in fiscal  disney royalty and remodel expenses represented approximately of net sales 
during fiscal  we remodeled disney stores 
during fiscal  repair  maintenance and utility expenses were approximately higher as a percentage of net sales due to our continued focus on enhancing the store environment  and increased utility costs 
during fiscal  store and administrative payroll was approximately higher as a percentage of net sales  and medical costs were approximately lower as compared to fiscal depreciation and amortization amounted to million or of net sales  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal excluding the million of depreciation expense associated with the disney store business  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of the children s place brand sales approximated in fiscal  which reflects higher fiscal infrastructure capital expenditures such as our new distribution center and enterprise software platforms 
fiscal depreciation and amortization expense for the disney store business represents the expense for assets put in service during the year as we remodeled and opened new stores 
no depreciation expense was recorded on acquired property and equipment since the fair value of net assets acquired exceeded the amounts paid for the dsna business 
our income tax provision was million during fiscal as compared to million during fiscal due to our increased profitability 
our effective tax rate was during fiscal versus in fiscal the improvement in the effective tax rate reflects tax efficiencies that were identified in the course of our global operations review  partially offset by the million expense associated with our approximately million repatriation under the american jobs creation act 
during fiscal  we recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of taxes 
this extraordinary gain represented the incremental gain required to be recognized upon the finalization of purchase accounting for the dsna business 
the extraordinary gain arose because the fair value of net assets acquired was in excess of the amounts paid to acquire the dsna business 
due to factors discussed above  net income for fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales increased by million  or  to billion during fiscal from million during fiscal net sales include million from the ten weeks we operated the disney stores since their acquisition on november  net sales from our the children s place business increased million  or during fiscal comparable store sales increased and contributed million of our net sales increase during fiscal during fiscal  our comparable store sales increase was the result of a increase in the number of comparable store sales transactions and a increase in our average dollar transaction size 
comparable store sales increased during fiscal net sales for our new stores as well as other stores that did not qualify as comparable stores increased our net sales by million 
during fiscal  we opened the children s place stores  in the united states  in canada and six in puerto rico 
in addition  we closed three the children s place stores and seven disney stores in fiscal during fiscal  we achieved double digit comparable store sales increases across all geographical regions  departments and store types in the children s place business 
our west and southwest regions reported the strongest comparable store sales increases 
by department  our accessories and boys departments achieved the highest comparable store sales increases 
gross profit increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal the decrease in gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was principally due to lower merchandise margins and the impact of the fair value write up of disney store inventory  partially offset by the leveraging of occupancy costs over a larger sales base 
for the children s place business  as a percentage of net sales  our merchandise margins were lower than last year due to a lower initial markup partially offset by lower markdowns 
our disney store business merchandise margins are lower than the children s place business  this unfavorably impacted gross margin by  as a percentage of net sales 
overall  the disney store business has a lower initial markup than the children s place business 
as mentioned above  gross profit during fiscal was unfavorably impacted by a million charge  or of net sales  for the write up of the acquired disney store inventory sold during the ten weeks ended january  to its fair value from the value determined under the retail inventory method 
approximately million in fair value inventory write up remained on our balance sheet as of january   which was charged to cost of sales during the first quarter of fiscal the remaining unfavorable gross margin variance  as a percentage of net sales  resulted primarily from higher distribution and buying expenses 
during fiscal  occupancy costs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased as a result of our comparable store sales increase and larger sales base 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales during fiscal as compared to of net sales during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower store payroll and the leveraging of store expense  partially offset by disney store royalty expense and transition services associated with the acquisition of the disney stores 
due to our strong comparable store sales performance during fiscal  our store payroll expenses were lower  as a percentage of net sales  than fiscal disney store royalty expense and transition costs represented approximately of net sales during fiscal the remainder of our favorable selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  resulted primarily from the leveraging of store expenses 
depreciation and amortization amounted to million  or of net sales  during fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of net sales  is the result of the leveraging of the expense over a larger sales base and the absence of depreciation and amortization for the dsna business 
excluding disney store sales  fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales approximates versus of sales in fiscal this improvement in percentage of net sales relates primarily to the same store sales improvement 
consistent with us gaap  since the fair value of net assets acquired exceeded the amounts paid to acquire the dsna business  we recorded no basis in the property and equipment we acquired with the dsna business  and therefore no depreciation expense was recorded 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal was million  as compared to a million provision in fiscal the increase in our tax provision was primarily due to our increased profitability in fiscal  as well as an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was favorably impacted by the reversal of a million valuation allowance on a prior year loss incurred by our canadian subsidiary 
during fiscal  we recorded a million extraordinary gain  net of taxes 
this extraordinary gain represents the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired in excess of amounts paid to acquire the dsna business 
due to the factors discussed above  net income in fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources debt service liquidity our working capital needs follow a seasonal pattern  peaking during the second and third quarters when inventory is purchased for the back to school and holiday selling seasons 
our primary uses of cash are financing new store openings and providing for working capital  which principally represent the purchase of inventory 
we have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash on hand  cash flows from operations and seasonal borrowings under our credit facilities 
we manage liquidity for the children s place and disney stores separately  including cash receipts and disbursements  investments  and credit facility borrowings and letter of credit activity 
the terms of the license agreement  the hoop loan agreement as defined below and the amended loan agreement as defined below  among other things  restrict the commingling of funds between the children s place and the hoop operating entities  and borrowings and certain distributions from the hoop operating entities to the children s place 
therefore  we have maintained segregation of all cash receipts and disbursements  investments  and credit facility borrowings and letter of credit activity 
this segregation could lead to a liquidity need in one business while there is adequate liquidity in the other business 
we believe that cash flow from operations and availability and borrowings under their respective credit facilities will be adequate to fund the growth needs and operations of each division 
at this time  we do not foresee a need for the children s place business to provide additional capital to the disney store business for that business to meet its growth objectives or operating commitments  nor do we foresee a need for the disney store business to make a distribution to its parent  other than normal payment of intercompany operating obligations  in order for the children s place business to meet its growth objectives or operating commitments 
we entered into a guaranty and commitment the guaranty and commitment dated as of november   in favor of the hoop operating entities and disney 
as required by the guaranty and commitment  we invested million in the hoop operating entities concurrently with the consummation of the acquisition  and agreed to invest up to an additional million to enable the hoop operating entities to comply with their obligations under the license agreement and otherwise fund the operations of the hoop operating entities 
to date  we have not been required to invest any of this additional million in the hoop operating entities in order to comply with the terms of the license agreement 
we also agreed to guarantee the payment and performance of the hoop operating entities for their royalty payment and other obligations to disney  subject to a maximum guaranty liability of million  plus expenses 
in connection with the acquisition of the dsna business  some of our subsidiaries and disney s subsidiaries entered into a license agreement under which the hoop operating entities have the right to use certain disney intellectual property in the dsna business in exchange for ongoing royalty payments 
the license agreement limits the ability of the hoop operating entities to make cash dividends or other distributions 
the hoop operating entitites independent directors must approve payment of any dividends or other distributions  other than payments of amounts due under terms of the tax sharing and intercompany services agreements  approximately million which represents a portion of the purchase price paid by the company to disney limited to cumulative cash flows since the date of the acquisition  and certain other dividend payments  subject to satisfaction of certain additional operating conditions and limited to of cumulative cash flows up to million  and of cumulative cash flows thereafter provided that at least million of cash and cash equivalents is maintained at the hoop operating entities 
in the normal course of business  the hoop operating entities have reimbursed intercompany services but have not paid any dividends or made other distributions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we plan to evaluate the hoop operating entities ability to reimburse the company for all or a portion of the million described above 
we do not expect the hoop operating entities to pay dividends to the company during the next months 
the hoop operating entities cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be utilized to finance store remodels and provide working capital 
the license agreement also restricts the incurrence of indebtedness in excess of certain permitted amounts 
as of october   we amended and restated our credit facility the amended loan agreement with wells fargo retail finance  llc  wells fargo  partly in connection with our acquisition of the dsna business 
the amended loan agreement provides for borrowings up to million including a sublimit for letters of credit of million 
the term of the facility ends on november  with successive one year renewal options 
the amount that can be borrowed under the amended loan agreement depends on our levels of inventory and accounts receivable relating to the children s place business 
the amended loan agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets  other than assets in canada and assets owned by our subsidiaries that were formed in connection with the acquisition of the dsna business 
amounts outstanding under the amended loan agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate or  at our option  a libor rate plus a pre determined margin 
the libor margin is to  and the unused line fee under the amended loan agreement is 
the amended loan agreement also contains covenants  which include limitations on our annual capital expenditures  maintenance of certain levels of excess collateral and a prohibition on the payment of dividends

the term of the facility extends until november  the hoop loan agreement contains various covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  maintenance of certain levels of excess collateral and restrictions on the payment of dividends and indebtedness 
credit extended under the hoop loan agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all the assets of hoop usa and hoop canada as well as a pledge of a portion of the equity interests in hoop canada 
borrowings and letters of credit under the hoop loan agreement are used by hoop usa and its subsidiary hoop canada for working capital purposes for the dsna business 
amounts outstanding under the hoop loan agreement bear interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus a pre determined margin or  at hoop operating entity s option  the libor rate plus a pre determined margin 
the prime rate margin is and the libor margin is or  depending on the domestic hoop operating entity s level of excess availability 
as of january  and as of january   we had no borrowings under the hoop loan agreement 
letters of credit outstanding were million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
availability under the hoop loan agreement was million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  there were no borrowings under the hoop loan agreement other than letters of credit that cleared after business hours 
the average loan balance under the hoop loan agreement during fiscal approximated  the maximum overnight borrowings during fiscal were million 
the interest rate charged under the hoop loan agreement was and per annum as of january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  we expect to have seasonal borrowings under the amended loan agreement and the hoop loan agreement 
we expect to use both credit facilities to support letters of credit throughout fiscal we were in compliance with all of the covenants  as amended  under the amended loan agreement and the hoop loan agreement as of january  noncompliance with these covenants could result in additional fees  affect our ability to borrow or require us to repay the outstanding balance 
cash flows capital expenditures cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  cash flow from operations were driven by net income of million 
significant non cash expenses included million of depreciation and amortization expense and million of net royalty expense 
in fiscal  we were in the royalty holiday period for our disney stores  and therefore  all of the royalty expense was non cash 
the major operating asset that was used in operating activities was inventories  which accounted for approximately million 
this increase in inventories primarily reflected the earlier flow of our spring inventory for both businesses  and for disney stores  our planned unit increase in support of our value pricing strategy 
offsetting this use of cash flows in operating activities were a million increase in taxes payable resulting from our higher taxable income in fiscal and the timing of estimated tax payments  and a million increase in deferred rent liabilites primarily reflecting the growth in landlord incentives received for new stores opened at the children s place 
in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities increased primarily as a result of the cash conversion of acquired disney store net working capital  which was primarily inventory  and increases in our current liabilities and operating earnings 
in fiscal  cash flow from operating activities was driven by the non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense  and investments in inventory offset by increases in accrued expenses  interest and other current liabilities and deferred rent  which included landlord incentives 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  capital expenditures increased million due to our increased number of new stores and remodels  investments made for our new distribution center in south brunswick  new jersey  upgrades in our other distribution centers to support the disney store acquisition  our new office facility in pasadena  california  and other information technology infrastructure investments required to operate our significantly larger business 
during fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to the acquisition of the dsna business for million  capital expenditures related to store openings and remodelings  and investments in our logistics and information technology infrastructure  partially offset by the net sale of million of auction rate securities 
the number of new store openings and remodelings have a significant impact on our cash flows used in investing activities 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we opened  and stores  respectively while remodeling  and stores  respectively 
during fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities also included a net million investment in auction rate securities 
cash flows used in provided by financing activities were million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities represented the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  which reflects repayments of borrowings to fund the acquisition of the dsna business  offset by higher exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchases

during fiscal  cash flows provided by financing activities reflected funds received from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will approximate million in fiscal we also anticipate receiving million in lease incentives in fiscal the capital expenditures will relate primarily to the opening of approximately the children s place stores and approximately disney stores  and the remodeling of approximately the children s place stores and disney stores 
during fiscal  we also plan to expand our administrative office facilities and make improvements to our distribution centers 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations and funds available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital and other cash flow requirements for at least the next months 
our ability to meet our capital requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash flows from operations 
in addition  we may consider additional sources of financing to fund our long term growth 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual and commercial obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations dollars in thousands total year or less years years after years operating leases employment contracts minimum disney store royalty unaudited long term debt capital leases total amounts of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments dollars in thousands amounts committed year or less years years after years credit facilities purchase commitments merchandise letters of credit standby letters of credit includes severance obligations due upon termination 
certain employment contracts also provide for continued medical coverage for a specified period 
the cost of these medical benefits was not estimated 
while royalty payments will commence in november for certain stores  beginning in fiscal  we are subject to minimum royalties 
see note commitments and contingencies for a description of the computation of the minimum royalty 
the company has estimated its fiscal minimum royalty and used that figure to impute the minimum royalty due over the initial year term of the license agreement 
this estimate does not include future increases or decreases in disney store sales and cost of living adjustments since these are unknown contingencies 
the actual minimum royalty may differ materially from the amount currently estimated 
represents purchase orders for merchandise for re sale of approximately million and commitments to purchase capital equipment of approximately million 
represents letters of credit issued to landlords  banks  insurance companies and disney subsidiaries 
we do not expect a cash outlay for these stand by letters of credit during as of january   under the license agreement  as amended  we are committed to remodel by january  a minimum of approximately of the stores acquired as of the closing date  of which were remodeled in fiscal this remodel commitment is subject to revision depending upon what actions management takes regarding  among other things  the timing and nature of lease renewals for acquired stores 
due to the varying cost of each remodel and additional changes to the prototype that are being considered by us  we are unable to reasonably quantify the total commitment amount or timing of these remodels 
quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors  including overall economic conditions  the timing of new store openings and related pre opening and other startup costs  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  weather conditions  shifts in timing of certain holidays  changes in our merchandise mix and pricing strategy 
our business is also subject to seasonal influences  with heavier concentrations of sales during the back to school and holiday seasons 
our first quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the period leading up to the easter holiday 
our third quarter results are heavily dependent upon back to school sales at the children s place and upon halloween sales at disney store 
our fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season 
as is the case with many retailers of apparel and related merchandise  we typically experience lower net sales and net income during the first two fiscal quarters  and net sales and net income are lower during the second fiscal quarter than during the first fiscal quarter 
we experienced losses in the second quarter of and the second quarter of and expect to experience a second quarter loss in fiscal it is also possible we could experience losses in other quarters 
because of these fluctuations in net sales and net income loss  the results of operations of any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data and selected operating data for each of our last eight fiscal quarters 
the quarterly statement of operations data and selected operating data set forth below  which reflects the retrospective application of construction period occupancy costs  were derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and reflect  in our opinion  all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of operations for these fiscal quarters in thousands  except per share data fiscal year ended january  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss basic net income loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share comparable store sales increase stores open at end of period fiscal year ended january  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted as adjusted net sales gross profit operating income loss net income loss basic net income loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share comparable store sales increase stores open at end of period third quarter of fiscal includes an extraordinary gain net of taxes of million  or per share  resulting from the finalization of the fair value of the dsna business acquired versus the amount we paid 
fourth quarter of fiscal included weeks of operations for the disney store business  commencing november  fourth quarter also included an extraordinary gain of million  or per share  after taxes  resulting from the difference between the fair value of the dsna business acquired versus the amount we paid 
the store count includes disney stores acquired in the fourth quarter 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company s financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
the company utilizes cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash  cash equivalents and investments are normally invested in short term financial instruments that will be used in operations within a year of the balance sheet date 
because of the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments 
the company s credit facilities with wells fargo provide a source of financing for its working capital requirements 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at either a floating rate equal to the prime rate or a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus a pre determined spread 
at the company s option  it could also borrow at a libor rate plus a pre determined spread 
as of january   the company had no borrowings under the amended loan agreement or the hoop loan agreement 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada and hong kong 
the company s investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  are generally considered long term 
the company does not generally hedge these net investments 
as of january   the company is not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
as of january   the company had approximately million of its cash balance held in foreign countries  of which approximately million was in canada and approximately million in hong kong 
while the company does not have substantial financial assets in china  it imports a large percentage of its merchandise from that country 
the company believes that the revaluation of the chinese yuan should not have a material impact on its fiscal financial results as purchase orders are negotiated in us dollars 
however  any significant or sudden change in china s political  foreign trade  financial  banking or currency policies and practices could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in addition to the company s asian operations  the company has a growing business in canada 
while currency rates with the canadian dollar have moved in the company s favor  there can be no guarantee that this will continue or that the exchange rate will not move against the company 
foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation 
the company is sensitive to customers spending patterns which are subject to prevailing regional and national economic conditions such as consumer confidence  recession  interest rates  energy prices  taxation  and unemployment to name a few 
the company is  and will continue to be  susceptible to changes in weather conditions  national and regional economic conditions  raw material costs  demographic and population characteristics  hourly wage legislation  consumer preferences and other regional factors 
as is the case with many retailers  the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and net income 
net sales and net income are generally weakest during the first two fiscal quarters  and are lower during the second fiscal quarter than during the first fiscal quarter 
first quarter results at the children s place are heavily dependent upon sales leading up to the easter holiday 
third quarter results are heavily dependent on back to school sales at the children s place stores and the disney store is heavily dependent on halloween sales 
fourth quarter results are heavily dependent upon sales during the holiday season 
weak sales during any of these periods could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of other factors  including weather conditions  overall macro economic conditions  the timing of new store openings and related pre opening and other start up costs  net sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable stores sales  shifts in the timing of certain holidays  and changes in our merchandise mix or pricing strategy 
moreover  a significant portion of disney store net sales are generated during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  which may  therefore  make the seasonality of the total company more heavily weighted to those quarters 
any failure to meet the company s business plans for  in particular  the third and fourth quarter of any fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on earnings  which in all likelihood would not be offset by satisfactory results achieved in other quarters of the same fiscal year 
in addition  because the company s expense levels are based in part on expectations of future sales levels  a shortfall in expected sales could result in a disproportionate decrease in net income 
under the provisions of sfas r  the company will be required to record compensation costs for its various equity plans for employees and directors 
under the measurement provisions of sfas r  interest rates  the company s stock price and the volatility of the company s stock price each have a significant impact on the determination of equity value  changes in these factors could have a material adverse impact on the determination of equity compensation costs  and therefore  impact future results of operations 
the company s risk mitigation for these factors is to limit or cease its equity compensation plans  which the company does not feel is reasonable given the competition for highly talented and qualified employees
