item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iris international  inc consists of three operating units 
our largest unit  iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets in vitro diagnostics ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis 
our sample processing division markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing  and our advanced digital imaging and research llc adir subsidiary assists in the advancement of proprietary imaging technology while conducting government sponsored research and contract development in imaging and pattern recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and sample processing instruments and supplies 
revenues from ivd instruments include sales of urine microscopy analyzers manufactured by us and urine chemistry analyzers purchased from a japanese manufacturer 
we sell the urine microscopy analyzers worldwide and fully automated urine chemistry analyzers domestically 
in addition  we expect to initiate sales of a semi automated chemistry analyzer  the ichem in the second quarter of consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale  which is covered by product warranties 
once the analyzers are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue will continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments increases 
revenue is also generated from sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies  which primarily consists of centrifuge systems  dna processing workstations and blood analysis products 
these products are sold worldwide through distributors 
domestic sales are direct to the customer through our sales force  whereas international sales  with the exception of france  are through independent distributors 
sales in france are direct to end use customers 
international sales represented of consolidated revenues in as compared to in since the launch of our iq product line  we have increased our sales efforts in the international marketplace  with the ultimate goal of balancing our urinalysis business between domestic and international markets 
since international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than domestic sales of the same products  but we do not incur sales and marketing costs for such sales 
on june   we completed the acquisition of the assets primarily technology and inventory of the urinalysis business of quidel corporation 
our total acquisition cost amounted to million 
with this acquisition  we acquired significant core technology and know how in urine chemistry strips  patents and trademarks  product designs  a strip manufacturing facility in germany and a semi automated urine chemistry analyzer that will enable us to offer a more complete product line 
we make significant investments in research and development for new products and enhancements to existing products 
we internally fund research and development programs  and through adir  we also receive government grants to fund various research activities 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are primarily derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met a an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  b customer credit worthiness has been established  and c delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
the majority of domestic ivd instrument sales generally include installation and training to be performed 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements which generally requires revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
multiple elements of our domestic product sales include ivd instruments and training 
training elements are valued based on hourly rates  which we charge for these services when sold apart from hardware sales 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
a portion of our revenues are derived from sale type leases as we provide lease financing to certain customers that purchase our diagnostic instruments 
leases under these arrangements are classified as sales type leases 
these leases typically have terms of five years 
revenue from sales type leases are recognized when collectibility of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us as lessor under the lease 
the minimum lease payments that accrue to our benefit as lessor are recorded as the gross investment in the lease 
the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the sum of the present value of the minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value  accruing to our benefit as lessor  are recorded as unearned income 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
we recognize that although we have introduced our new iq product line of analyzers  an installed based of our legacy products still exist 
we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products  a portion of which is classified as a long term asset on our balance sheet 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to have net realizable value 

table of contents capitalized software we capitalize software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of capitalized software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities

off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd instruments  consumables and service  as well as sales of sample processing instruments and supplies 
in our cash and cash equivalents increased million to million 
on june   we completed the acquisition of the assets of the urinalysis business of quidel corporation 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we paid  in cash and assumed approximately  in accrued liabilities

financing activities 
for the year ended december   financing activities provided million of cash primarily from the issuances of common stock for stock options and warrant exercises as well as purchases of shares by employees through the company s employee stock purchase plan compared to million received during during we utilized million for repayment of debt 
in may  we signed a credit facility with a major bank 
the credit facility consists of a million revolving line of credit for working capital and a million line of credit for acquisitions and product opportunities 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit are limited to a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory 
the entire credit facility has variable interest rates  which will change from time to time based on changes to either the libor rate or the lender s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share based payments for services provided by employees 
this pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications  cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting january  compensation expense for new equity awards  in most cases  will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period 
an award of a liability instrument  as defined by this pronouncement  will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement 
under the terms of this pronouncement  we and other issuers will begin to expense equity awards using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the fair value of those awards on their respective grant dates 
for periods before the required effective date for which financial statements have not yet been issued  we had the option to elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required by statement no 
in october  the board of directors approved a resolution whereby all employee options then outstanding were fully vested 
in accordance with fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock options  we recorded a charge to earnings in the amount of  representing an estimate for employee turnover during the remaining vesting period 
management took this action to mitigate the effect on future earnings of implementing sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  and began to expense previously issued equity awards for which service has not been rendered on that date 
as of december   existing employee stock options were fully vested  accordingly there was no expense for such options that would be recognized in year subsequent to

 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter sfas no 
requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage be recorded as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for us on january  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 
healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates
