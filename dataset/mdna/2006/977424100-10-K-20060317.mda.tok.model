our e learning applications deliver ongoing training tailored to csr needs and competencies 
we also provide consulting and implementation services  training and support to customers that use our software products 
we derive product revenue by licensing software and derive services revenue by providing related installation  training  consulting  and maintenance services 
we also derive a relatively small portion of product revenue by selling hardware to customers 
the majority of our product revenue is derived from quality monitoring qm and workforce management wfm software 
we sell our products through our direct sales force and through our indirect sales channels 
our indirect sales channels consist of distributors  resellers  systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers oem 
distributors and resellers purchase product from us at a discount and then resell our products to end users or  in the case of distributors  to other resellers and referral partners are paid a fee for referring sales leads to us or for assisting us in a sales order 
systems integrators are information technology it consulting service companies who recommend our products during client engagements 
through oem agreements  we co develop products  which are sold by the oem as part of their portfolio of products 
we intend to continue to expand our global sales channels by entering into new reseller  distributor  oem and similar arrangements with key vendors in the contact center workforce optimization market 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our license revenue has been derived from the indirect sales channel 
we plan to grow our product revenue and maintain our competitive position from a technology perspective through the timely introduction of new products  such as pre packaged solutions  which add capabilities such as performance analysis and e learning management to our core quality monitoring and workforce management solutions 
we also believe the market shift from traditional hardware based recording to voip represents a significant growth opportunity and our software solutions support both of these recording environments 
in addition  we believe our product offerings can be marketed toward branch office and back office initiatives for business process monitoring  which represents a new market for us 
factors that may impact our ability to grow our product revenue  however  include our ability to remain competitive from a technology perspective  market acceptance of our new products  our ability to maintain our product pricing integrity  and our ability to expand our global sales channels 
we also plan to grow our services revenue in concert with our product revenue 
when our customers license our products  they generally purchase installation  training and one year of support services 
therefore  as we generate product revenue  we also generate related services revenue 
in addition  our customers generally renew their maintenance contracts with us each year 
therefore  our maintenance revenue increases as our customer base increases 
factors that may influence our ability to grow our services revenue  however  include our ability to continue to increase product revenues  provide services that enable and enhance our customers ability to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their call center operations and our ability to maintain a high level of customer success and satisfaction 
on january   we acquired blue pumpkin software  inc blue pumpkin  a privately held california corporation 
with this acquisition  we have extended our workforce optimization solution to include advanced workforce management software and services solutions including forecasting  scheduling  adherence and planning applications 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement and plan of reorganization  dated december  the acquisition agreement  we paid million in cash which was funded from our existing cash and investments and issued million shares of witness common stock valued at million measured at the date the stock consideration became fixed pursuant to the application of a formula specified in the merger agreement 
on may   the shares issued in connection with the acquisition were registered for resale with the securities and exchange commission 
approximately ten percent of the aggregate acquisition consideration was placed into escrow to compensate witness  subject to certain limitations  for potential losses that could result from  among other things  the iex litigation and other specified litigations and breaches of blue pumpkin s representations  warranties or covenants in the purchase agreement 
blue pumpkin has tentatively reached a settlement in the litigation with iex  and in partial satisfaction of the potential losses expected to result from the settlement and other claims that witness has made against the escrow fund  the escrow fund is expected to be released to witness 
see note of the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this report for discussion of the blue pumpkin acquisition 
on may   we acquired optimis group limited optimis  a uk based provider of workforce optimization software solutions 
blue pumpkin owned a minority interest in an operating subsidiary of optimis  the balance of which was acquired through the optimis acquisition 
we paid million in cash and other consideration that was financed from our existing cash and investments 
ten percent of the aggregate acquisition consideration is being held in escrow until may  the escrow period may be extended in the event that there are pending claims that are brought against the escrow fund within such period 
the escrow fund is available to compensate witness  subject to certain limitations  for losses resulting from  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants in the purchase agreement and certain pending and potential claims 
in  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved stock option awards for approximately  shares of witness common stock to certain blue pumpkin and optimis employees as an inducement to join witness 
these inducement options have an exercise price equal to the market value on the date of the grant  subject to standard provisions for termination  forfeiture and acceleration  and are exercisable for five years from the date of grant 
the inducement options will first become exercisable  as to percent of the total amount  after one year from the date of grant  and commencing months after grant and until the end of the th month following grant  the options will become exercisable as to an additional two percent per month and the balance upon the th month following grant 
during  and   and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from customers outside the united states 
we had full time employees  excluding approximately contractors located in the asia pacific region  at december   compared to at december  and at december  as of december   full time employees were located outside the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  accounting policies and judgments including those related to revenue recognition  the collectibility of receivables  accounting for acquisitions  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  and sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue is primarily derived from licensing software and providing related services including maintenance 
we also derive a relatively small portion of product revenue by selling hardware to customers since our acquisition of eyretel 
product revenue  which includes software and hardware  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
we report hardware revenue gross in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  because the factors indicating gross reporting outweigh the factors indicating net reporting 
we recognize revenue using the residual method of accounting since we generally have vsoe for maintenance and professional services  but not for the software and hardware elements of the order 
under the residual method  services revenue  including maintenance and professional services  is deferred at an amount equal to its fair value until those elements are delivered 
consequently  product revenue for the software and hardware may be recognized i upon delivery of those products when we have vsoe on the related maintenance and professional services sold and ii at an amount representing the difference between the total order amount and the amount deferred 
services revenue includes installation  training  consulting  maintenance and reimbursable travel expenses 
revenue from installation  training and consulting services is recognized upon performance of the related services and is offered and billed as separate elements of contracts 
reimbursable travel expenses revenue is recognized upon incurrence of the related expenses 
the functionality of the software and any hardware sold is not dependent on installation and training services and customization is not required to enable our customers to use our products 
maintenance is offered as a separate element and the majority of contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience with write offs and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot assure that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past or adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and resulted in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional selling  general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates affect the application of our revenue policy described above 
further  assessment of collectibility is particularly critical in determining whether or not revenues should be recognized 
we also record provisions for estimated sales allowances on product and service related revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales and services allowances  analysis of customer credits and other known factors 
if future sales credits prove to be greater than the historical data and the estimates we used to calculate these provisions  our revenues could be overstated 
accounting for acquisitions 
accounting for acquisitions requires management to make judgments and estimates in determining the purchase price  the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired and merger related and integration costs 
in recording the blue pumpkin and optimis acquisitions in  significant judgment was required in estimating valuation of deferred revenue  valuation of intangible assets and acquired in process research and development  other liabilities existing at the time of acquisition 
changes to purchase price estimates are reflected as adjustments to goodwill and or other acquired assets to the extent information was requested but not received at the date of acquisition 
other adjustments are reflected in our results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may no longer be recoverable 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets  are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
all of our identifiable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are reviewed annually with any changes in estimated useful lives being accounted for prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
recoverability of assets to be held and used would be measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the determination of estimated future cash flows  however  requires management to make estimates 
future events and changes in circumstances may require us to record a significant impairment charge in the period in which such events or changes occur 
impairment testing requires considerable analysis and judgment in determining the results 
if other assumptions and estimates were used in our evaluations  the results could differ significantly 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires companies to recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and the expected benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets  primarily resulting from net operating loss and credit carryforwards  and adjust our valuation allowance  if necessary 
if we were to recognize the tax benefit associated with our net operating loss carryforwards  we would expect our provision for income tax expense in future periods to reflect an effective tax rate that will be significantly higher than past periods 
furthermore  the utilization of deferred tax assets  primarily net operating loss carryforwards arising from acquisitions  has resulted and will continue to result in a reduction in goodwill and the recognition of tax expense associated with the purchased deferred tax assets 
the adoption of sfas r  as noted below  will potentially result in tax benefits that are currently difficult to predict 
estimates and judgments are required in determining our worldwide income tax expense 
in the ordinary course of conducting business globally  there are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
stock based compensation 
we have generally not recorded compensation expense for options granted to our employees because all options granted under our stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
the pro forma disclosures of stock based compensation include the use of certain input factors in calculating the fair value of stock option grants  some of which require management to make estimates and use judgment in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment which  among other things  requires that compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for share based awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
it will also require the benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
the share based compensation cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
effective january   we expect to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  but not on our cash flows results of operations the table below shows operating data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue product services total revenue cost of revenue product services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development merger related and integration costs acquired in process research and development operating loss income interest and other income  net loss income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income impact of blue pumpkin and optimis acquisitions the acquisition of blue pumpkin and optimis in increased our reported revenues in by an estimated million compared to the same period in operating expenses  expressed as a percentage of total revenue  also increased in compared to the same period in due to a charge of million in acquired in process research and development costs  an increase of million in merger related and integration costs and additional intangible asset amortization of million 
revenue total revenue increased by to million in compared to and to million in compared to the increase in total revenue can be attributed to both continued growth of our business and growth through acquisition 
the number of installed customer sites grew to  sites at the end of from  sites at the end of and  sites at the end of international revenue increased in compared to and in compared to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies increased revenue by approximately in compared to and in compared to product revenue includes software revenue and hardware revenue 
hardware sales are incidental to our business and we are working toward transitioning our customers to third party hardware suppliers 
we expect hardware revenue to decline in the future 
product revenue  excluding hardware revenue of million in  million in and million in  increased and in and  respectively  compared to prior years 
the increase in software revenue growth in is attributed to our expanded product line resulting from our acquisitions of blue pumpkin and optimis which are included in our results effective january  and may   respectively 
product revenue as a percentage of total revenue has decreased slightly over the past three years due to lower hardware sales and increased services revenue  as discussed below 
our product pricing has remained relatively consistent over the past three years 
the percentage of product revenue  excluding hardware revenue  derived from our indirect sales channel increased to in from in and in this increase results from our strategy to expand our indirect sales channels 
new customers accounted for  and  respectively  of product revenue  excluding hardware revenue  in  and  with the balance of revenue representing follow on revenue from our existing customer base 
we receive follow on revenue from our customers when they purchase additional user licenses or license additional applications at existing sites and when they license our products at new sites 
we expect to generate the majority of our product revenue from existing customers during services revenue  consisting of installation  training  consulting  maintenance support and reimbursable travel expenses  increased to million in compared to and to million in compared to the increases were due to installation and training services related to new product sales and due to customers renewing their maintenance contracts with us thereby increasing our recurring maintenance revenue stream 
the percentage of witness customers that have renewed their maintenance contracts with us has historically exceeded 
we believe that maintenance contracts will be renewed at a comparable rate during our services pricing has remained consistent over the past three years 
we expect services revenue  in absolute dollars  to increase over time due to the compounding effect of renewals of annual maintenance contracts from existing customer sites and to remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue  excluding hardware revenue in cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in compared to and to million in compared to expressed as a percent of revenue  gross profit margins have remained constant at in  and excluding hardware and the amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions  gross margins have remained consistent at in  and we expect our gross profit margin  excluding hardware and amortization of intangible assets  to remain relatively constant in cost of product revenue consists of amortization of acquired technology  hardware costs  royalties due to third parties for software components that are embedded in our software applications  amortization of capitalized software development costs and packaging costs 
amortization of acquired technology was million in and million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in the amortization of acquired technology in was due to the acquisition of blue pumpkin 
cost of hardware revenue was million million and million in  and  respectively 
we will continue to incur amortization expense  but expect the cost of hardware to decline as we work towards reducing the amount of hardware sales in the future 
cost of product revenue  excluding amortization of acquired technology and hardware costs  increased in compared to and in compared to the increase in was primarily due to increased royalties due to third parties for software included in our product offerings 
expressed as a percentage of product revenue  excluding hardware  the cost of such revenue  excluding amortization of intangible assets was   and in  and  respectively 
as we develop upgrades of our existing products and add new offerings to our product suite  we may add additional third party technology into our products  which would increase the cost of product revenue in the future 
cost of services revenue for installation  training  consulting and maintenance services include personnel costs and related expenses and allocated overhead 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses and benefits 
cost of services revenue increased to million in compared to due primarily to an increase in the number of employees and contractors engaged in customer support services mainly as a result of the blue pumpkin and optimis acquisitions 
cost of services revenue increased to million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the number of employees engaged in installation  training  consulting  and customer support services primarily due to the eyretel acquisition 
cost of services revenue as a percentage of services revenue decreased to in from in and we anticipate that our services margins will remain relatively constant in we expect our customer service organization to continue to grow over time and  therefore  we anticipate that our cost of services revenue  in absolute dollars  will increase as we grow our customer base 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense consists primarily of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs  professional fees  the amortization of certain intangible assets and provisions for bad debt expense 
sg a expense increased to million in compared to due primarily to higher amortization expenses and the increased size of our company due to acquisitions of blue pumpkin and optimis 
sg a expense increased to million in compared to this increase was due to the increased size of our company after the eyretel acquisition and due to a full year of amortization of intangible assets acquired in in  we expect sg a expense to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of total revenue due to anticipated revenue growth as compared to the same period in research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel and consulting costs to support product development  and allocated overhead 
r d costs are generally expensed as incurred and include software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility 
costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives to cost of product revenue 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  in software development costs were capitalized of which million and million was amortized to cost of product revenue in and  respectively 
r d expenses increased to million in compared to primarily due to the increased number of employees engaged in research and development activities as a result of the blue pumpkin acquisition 
r d expenses increased to million in compared to due to an increased number of contractors engaged in research and development activities 
we expect total r d expense to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of total revenue during as compared to merger related and integration costs 
we incurred merger related and integration costs of million in  primarily due to the blue pumpkin and optimis acquisitions 
we incurred merger related costs of million during and million during due to the eyretel acquisition 
the merger related and integration costs are comprised primarily of costs of transitional employees and other contractors  travel costs  legal costs and advertising costs 
in march  our board of directors agreed to pay a bonus of million to our coo in connection with the eyretel acquisition and subsequent integration 
in march  million of this bonus was paid and the remaining balance of million was paid in march acquired in process research and development 
during  we estimated that million of the purchase price of blue pumpkin represented acquired in process research and development ipr d that had not yet reached technological feasibility as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
the value of the ipr d was determined with the assistance of an independent third party appraiser by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies and taking into consideration stage of completion  complexity of work to date and to complete  anticipated product development and introduction schedules  forecasted product sales cycles  internal and external risk factors  revenue and operating expense estimates  contributory asset charges  and costs already incurred and the expected costs to complete

interest and other income  net interest and other income  net for year  and  respectively is as follows in thousands interest income foreign currency loss gain other expense income interest and other income  net decreased to million in compared to due primarily to a decreased interest income resulting from lower investment balances as a result of the acquisitions of blue pumpkin and optimis 
interest and other income  net decreased to million in compared to due primarily to decreased interest income resulting from lower yields and lower investment balances as a result of the acquisition of eyretel which was paid for in cash 
we expect that interest and other income  net will increase in compared to due to higher cash and investment balances resulting from our common stock offering in december provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for federal alternative minimum tax  deferred taxes and foreign income tax in  a provisions for federal alternative minimum tax and foreign income tax in and provisions for foreign income tax in  net of federal tax benefits 
of the million provision for the year ended december   million related to the utilization of a portion of the of deferred income tax assets  primarily net operating loss carry forwards  acquired in the acquisition of blue pumpkin 
because a full valuation allowance was recorded against these assets  the benefit from the utilization of these deferred income tax assets in was credited as a reduction to goodwill 
the provision for income taxes in  and benefited from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
we have net operating loss carryforwards aggregating million for us income tax purposes and million for foreign income tax purposes remaining as of december  we expect that the provision for income taxes in will benefit from the utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards 
however  the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards arising from acquisitions will result in a reduction of the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets and goodwill or intangible assets and the recognition of deferred income tax expense 
quarterly results of operations the following tables present unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the last eight quarters in the two year period ended december   as well as the percentage of total revenue represented by each item

the increase in total revenue  beginning in the first and second quarters of  reflects the consolidation of blue pumpkin and optimis  which were acquired in january and may  respectively

 revenue hardware gross profit margins were negatively impacted in due primarily to the increase in the merger related and integration expense as a result of blue pumpkin and optimis acquisitions 
total operating expenses  excluding merger related costs and acquired ipr d  decreased as a percentage of total revenue during and as revenue growth exceeded cost increases 
in  we recorded million of intangible assets amortization expense associated with the blue pumpkin and optimis acquisition 
our quarterly operating results  particularly product revenues  have experienced significant fluctuations in the past and we expect that this pattern will continue in the future 
for instance  quarterly results may fluctuate based on the timing of sales due to customer calendar year budgeting cycles  slow summer purchasing patterns and compensation policies that tend to compensate sales personnel  typically in the latter half of the year  for achieving annual quotas 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results are not necessarily meaningful  and such comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in total cash and cash equivalents and investments  compared to million at december  working capital also increased by million from million at december  to million at december  the increase is due to proceeds from the common stock offering during december  offset by the cash portion of the acquisitions of blue pumpkin and optimis cash flows provided by operating activities in were million compared to million in the same year ago period 
the cash flows provided by operations in were significantly impacted by payments of restructuring accruals and merger related and integration costs and an increase in accounts receivable resulting from acquisitions 
there are no significant merger related and restructuring costs remaining as of december  our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso at december  was days  an increase of days from december  this increase in dso and the decrease in deferred revenue of million in  was primarily due to timing differences in payments received from customers 
we expect our dso to remain in the day range and our deferred revenue balance to increase in deferred revenue decreased million in as a result of year end maintenance renewal invoices outstanding 
net cash flows used in investing activities increased during to million compared to million in the same year ago period due to the acquisitions of blue pumpkin and optimis 
the cash portion of the blue pumpkin acquisition million or million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired was funded in part through the sale of investment securities totaling million 
we also paid million for optimis or million net of cash and cash equivalents acquired 
in  we used million in net cash flows in investing activities from the acquisition of eyretel  offset by the net proceeds of our investments 
capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  were primarily for computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash flows provided by financing activities in were million compared to million in the increase was due to million in proceeds from the secondary offering of common stock completed in december net cash flows provided by financing activities were million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
at december   we had million available under a line of credit  which was net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit secure the lease on our corporate headquarters facility and have decreasing schedules that ultimately expire in at our election  borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate  or libor plus basis points  and are limited to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined by the agreement 
the revolving line of credit is secured by all of our assets and requires compliance with various covenants  including liquidity ratios and tangible net worth requirements  among others 
as of december   we were in compliance with all bank covenants 
we anticipate spending at least million in capital expenditures in primarily for computer equipment and software 
we believe that our capital expenditures may increase over the next several years as we expand our facilities and acquire equipment to support the expansion of our research and development activities and internal management and information systems 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances  together with our anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  the availability under our line of credit may be used to fund working capital requirements or future merger or acquisition transactions 
market risk our market risk exposure primarily relates to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
except for the hedge transaction entered into in connection with the eyretel acquisition  we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions to manage risk in connection with such fluctuations 
due to the relative weakness of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar  the translation of our subsidiaries cash denominated in foreign currencies reduced our december  cash balances by million 
due to the relative strength of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar during and  foreign currency translations contributed million and million to our cash balances at december  and  respectively 
within our foreign based operations  where transactions may be denominated in foreign currencies  we are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have foreign based operations in australia  brazil  canada  china  germany  india  japan  mexico  the netherlands  singapore  south africa and the united kingdom that conduct transactions in either the local currency of the location or us dollars 
we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  cummulative translation adjustment changes resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity of million in and an increase of million in  respectively 
net foreign exchange loss gains reflected in our operating results were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio and any potential borrowing 
our investments are made with capital preservation and liquidity as our primary objectives 
we generally hold only high grade investments such as commercial paper  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and us government agency securities 
to reduce our balance sheet exposure to variations in asset values  our investment policy guidelines specify that we invest in the highest investment grade securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of nine months or less for our entire portfolio
