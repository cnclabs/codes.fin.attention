executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc the company  we  us  or our  hereafter succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  prior to the completion of the reorganization  the bank was subject to the information  reporting and proxy statement requirements of the exchange act  pursuant to the regulations of its primary regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic 
accordingly  the bank filed annual and quarterly reports  proxy statements and other information with the fdic 
pursuant to rule g of the exchange act  the company has succeeded to the reporting obligations of the bank and the reporting obligations of the bank to the fdic have terminated 
filings by the company under the exchange act  like this form k  are to be made with the sec 
note that while we refer generally to the company throughout this filing  all references to the company prior to august   except where otherwise indicated  are to the bank 
we operate community banks in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans  and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business by focusing on the continued development of our commercial and consumer lending divisions 
over the past several years  our network of branches and loan production offices has been expanded geographically 
we currently maintain sixteen branch offices and nine loan production offices 
in we opened two branch offices in our niche market and four loan production offices in four different states 
our expansion in these areas complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit 
in december  the bank issued million of the junior subordinated debentures 
subsequently  the company  as a wholly owned subsidiary in and as a parent company of the bank in  issued a total of  of junior subordinated debentures in connection with a  trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly owned by the company 
we believe that the supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of these debentures allowed us to achieve and maintain status as a well capitalized institution and sustained our continued loan growth 
as evidenced by our past several years of operations  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
we have implemented a strategy of building our core banking foundation by focusing on commercial loans and business transaction accounts 
our management believes that this strategy has created recurring revenue streams  diversified our product portfolio and enhanced shareholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance for operations during our total assets grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total loans grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our ratio of total non performing loans to total loans improved to at the end of from at the end of total noninterest income decreased to million in  or a decrease of from million in due mainly to the reduction of gain on sale of the nonguaranteed portion of sba loans  which is a non recurring source of revenue 
total noninterest expense increased from million in to million in  reflecting the expanded personnel and premises associated with our business growth 
due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in management believes that its efforts in cost cutting and revenue diversification have improved our operational efficiency  as evidenced by the improvement in our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and total noninterest income from in to in these items  as well as other factors  contributed to the increase in net income for to million  or per diluted common share as compared with million  or per diluted common share in and are discussed in further detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook as we look ahead to  we anticipate continued good financial performance 
we will continue to pursue opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through de novo branching and regional loan production offices 
further  we expect that our portfolio of unsecured business loans and consumer loans will continue to grow as a result of target marketing efforts in these areas 
we intend to continue our focus on loan and deposit growth and our net interest margin management  while improving efficient operations to control operating expenses so that our expenses grow more slowly than our business operations 
although interest rates decreased in  compressing our interest margins  we exhibited growth in net interest income 
as interest rates increased in and  our yield on earning assets increased 
should interest rates increase further  our yield on earnings assets will likely increase further although we cannot be certain as to the extent of such increases  if any 
we can then decide whether to increase the interest rates we pay on our deposit accounts or change the interest rates on new deposits in certain marketing activation programs  although such activities would reduce our net interest margin 
any increases in the rates we charge on our lending products could have an adverse effect on our efforts to attract new customers and grow loans  particularly with the continuing competition in the commercial and consumer lending industry 
the economies and real estate markets in our primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of our assets in future periods and  thus  our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
current economic indicators suggest that the national economy and the economies in our primary market areas are still expanding 
finally  we completed our reorganization into a holding company structure during the third quarter of we believe operating within a holding company structure  among other things allows us to use the portion of proceeds from the issuance of our trust preferred securities as tier capital within regulatory guidelines 
provides greater operating flexibility  facilitates the acquisition of related businesses as opportunities arise  improves our ability to diversify  enhances our ability to remain competitive in the future with other companies in the financial services industry that are organized in a holding company structure  and enhances our ability to raise capital to support growth 
for  management will be focused on the above challenges and opportunities and other factors affecting the business similar to the factors driving the results of results  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses accounting for allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimation of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
we evaluate each loan by use of a risk rating system  except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with sfas no 
we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectibility of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors detailed below will be considered to have no impact neutral to our loss migration analysis 
however  if there exists information to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
the credit risk matrix provides seven possible scenarios for each of the identified factors detailed below 
the matrix allows for three positive decrease major  moderate  and minor  three negative increase major  moderate  and minor  and one neutral credit risk scenario within each factor for each loan pool 
these possible scenarios enable management to adjust the loss migration ratio as much as in either direction positive or negative for each loan pool 
these adjustments are applied to the general allocation for each loan pool if warranted 
the factors currently considered are  but are not limited to concentration of credits concentrations of credit are loans to any single borrower  affiliated group of borrowers  or borrowers engaged in or dependent upon one industry that exceeds of tier capital and reserves 
a concentration of credit can also result from an acquisition of a volume of loans from a single source  regardless of the diversity of the individual borrowers 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the level of the concentration s and a determination if the concentration adversely affects us 
an adverse concentration may also occur where a disproportionate amount of our criticized and classified assets are derived from a single concentration source 
delinquency trends as a matter of practice  an increased negative adjustment will be made whenever i our loan delinquency ratio exceeds of total loans  and or ii our loan delinquencies have increased by of total loans in one period 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the severity of the trends 
a decreased positive adjustment may occur when the levels exceed the thresholds established above  but are improving as supported over  at a minimum  two consecutive quarters 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the improvements of the trend 
in instances where the levels are within the thresholds established above  a neutral risk posture will be taken 
nature and volume of loan trend this factor will be adjusted for significant changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio 
an increased negative adjustment to this factor generally may occur with i the establishment of a new or untested loan pool eg  a loan category or type not previously underwritten by us  or ii a significant shift in the loan categories that is outside of the loan mix parameters 
the decreased positive adjustment to this factor may occur if a problematic loan pool is eliminated or significantly reduced 
also  a decreased adjustment to this factor may occur if the total loan portfolio decreases to the point where in conjunction with changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff the depth of lending management is more than sufficient to manage the risk within the loan portfolio 
non accrual loan trend this factor may be adjusted when there is a significant upward movement of non accrual loans and troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan when  for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  we grant a concession to the borrower we would not otherwise consider 
an increased negative adjustment to this factor generally may occur when i non accrual loans exceed of total loans  and or ii non accrual loans over gross loans have increased by in one period 
in the case of tdrs  a determination will be made on a case by case basis whether the amount and number of tdrs  based on their performance and collateral protection  warrant increased reserves 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the severity of the trends 
a decreased positive adjustment may occur when levels exceed the thresholds established above  but are improving as supported over  at a minimum  two consecutive quarters 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the improvements of the trend 
problem loan trend this factor may be adjusted depending on the trend of criticized and classified loans 
an increased negative adjustment will be made whenever i classified loans exceed of tier capital and reserves  and or ii classified loans increase in one period by of gross loans 
a decrease positive adjustment may occur when the levels exceed the thresholds established above  but are improving as supported over  at minimum  two consecutive quarters 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the improvements of the trend 
in instances where the levels are within the thresholds established above  a neutral risk posture will be taken 
loss and recovery trend this factor may be adjusted depending on the comparison of peer banks 
an increased negative adjustment to this factor generally may occur when net charge off ratio exceeds those of peer banks 
the determination of whether the adjustments should be major  moderate or minor depends on the severity of the difference between our and our peer banks net charge off ratios 
quality of loan review this factor may be adjusted when there has been a noted and significant as determined and documented from external or internal sources deterioration or improvement in our loan review system and or management s oversight 
the extent of the adjustment will depend on the significance of the changes noted 
a positive decrease adjustment will generally occur when there has previously been a documented weakness and clear improvement was noted by external sources 
a negative increase adjustment will generally occur when a significant deterioration was noted by external sources in our loan review system and or the degree of oversight by management 
in the absence of noted changes to the loan review system and or the degree of oversight by the management  a neutral posture will be taken 
lending and management staff this factor will be adjusted with changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management and staff that are significant enough to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratio 
an increased negative adjustment would occur if we have been understaffed and or inexperienced to the point that the risk is measurably increased 
the extent of the adjustment depends on the perceived impact the staffing problem may have on the supervision of the loan portfolio 
conversely  if we have been understaffed or have lacked experience in a particular loan category or loan type and management has taken the appropriate action to adequately address these issues  then a decreased positive adjustment may be appropriate 
the extent of the adjustment depends on the perceived impact the adequate staffing situation may have on the loan supervision of the portfolio 
if the staffing or the experience level of lending staff is considered to be adequate as determined by an external source then  in general  a neutral posture will be taken 
lending policies and procedures this factor may be adjusted depending on the documented results of external reviews of our policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off and recovery practices 
if it is determined that there are significant deficiencies noted in our policies  procedures  underwriting standards or practices  then  as appropriate  the loss migration ratio may be adjusted to reflect the increased risk until such a time as the deficiencies are adequately addressed by management 
the determination of whether the adjustments should be major  moderate or minor depends on the extent and severity of the deficiency noted 
it is the objective of our management to maintain at all times adequate policies  procedures  underwriting standards and practices 
as a general rule  this factor will not be below a neutral scenario situation 
economic and business conditions this factor may be adjusted depending on local  regional and national economic trends and their perceived impact on our particular market segments 
an increased negative adjustment to this factor would occur in periods where the economic forecast is lackluster or negative 
the extent of the increased adjustment will depend on the forecast  together with its perceived impact on our loan portfolio pools 
in periods of recovery where economic forecasts are positive and vibrant  we may consider positive decreased adjustments to the loss migration ratio 
the extent of the decreased adjustments will depend on the forecast  together with its perceived impact on our loan portfolio pools 
in periods of economic stability  with forecasts of continued stability  the impact of this factor will be considered to be neutral 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
management currently intends to manage an unallocated allowance not to exceed of the total estimated allowance for loan losses  due to the inherent risk associated with the imprecision in estimating the allowance 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
sba loans certain small business administration sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loan among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting  at above the contract rate note rate  its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at above the effective interest rate of the related loan 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs typically basis points  and ii interest only strip receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  using a discount rate of above the effective interest rate of the related loan 
the servicing asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
management periodically evaluates the servicing asset for impairment 
impairment  if it occurs  is charged off in the period of impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral type 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
stock based compensation we issue stock based compensation to certain employees  officers  and directors 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to account for stock based compensation using the fair value method  which typically results in compensation expense recognition 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we continue to account for our fixed stock options using the intrinsic value method  prescribed in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations  which generally does not result in compensation expense recognition 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation cost for stock options is measured at the date of grant as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock over the exercise price of the options 
had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact on net income and earnings per share would have been equivalent to the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
currently  all of our investment securities are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses for available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income  as part of shareholders equity 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board frb 
average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
we have maintained the loan composition at of average interest earning assets for  and for average net loans were billion in  compared to million in and to million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
the frb s rate increases by a total of since june increased the average yields on interest earning assets to in and further increased them to in this growth of interest earning assets  especially in the loan portfolio  coupled with the increase in yields  significantly increased our total interest income by to million in  as compared with million in  which previously increased from million in average interest bearing liabilities increased by to billion in  compared to million in  after increasing by from million in we also increased other borrowings over the last months see deposits and other sources of funds below 
total interest expense increased by to million in after increasing by to million in due mainly to the significant growth of our deposit portfolio and higher rates in the average interest rate we paid for interest bearing deposits was in both and  and increased to in the increase in total interest expense in was primarily related to depositors shifting their funds into higher rate time deposits and the overall increase in market interest rates  and the increase in was primarily related to the volume increase in deposits and other borrowings 
the combined result of our growth and interest rate increases was an increase in net interest income 
net interest income increased by  or million  to million in  following an increase of or million in to million from million in the positive impact of the federal reserve board s rate increases since june improved our net interest margin from in to in and in the net interest spread also increased from in to in and in in  the frb raised its overnight lending rate eight times by an aggregate of two percent to 
the wall street journal prime rate was correspondingly increased to 
we are in an asset sensitive position  meaning that these rate increases positively affected our net interest margin  because more earning assets were immediately re priced than interest bearing liabilities 
although we price deposits competitively with the goal of continuing to fund our growing loan portfolio  our models indicate that our margin should expand in a rising interest rate environment

such charges were not made only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
we respond to potential loan losses proactively by identifying problem loans in a timely manner and by taking immediate actions to successfully curb increases in the level of non performing assets see financial condition nonperforming assets below for further discussion 
despite continued loan growth  our low level of nonperforming assets and recoveries of previously charged off loans reduced our provision for loan losses and loan commitments to million in from million in  which previously increased from million in the significant increase in was primarily related to the adjustment to the reserve for off balance sheet items caused by the application of the higher calculated loss migration ratio to off balance sheet items since the first quarter of we provided  for the credit risk of off balance sheet items in  as compared with  in and  for the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are described in the section entitled allowance for loan losses below 
net loan fees have been included in the calculation of interest income 
net loan fees were approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans are net of the allowance for loan losses  deferred fees  unearned income  and related direct costs  but includes those placed on non accrual status 
noninterest income total noninterest income decreased to million in from million in and increased from million in noninterest income was of average assets in  a decrease from and in and  respectively 
we currently earn non interest income from various sources  including an income stream provided by bank owned life insurance in the form of an increase in cash surrender value and gain on sale of mortgage loans and nonguaranteed portions of sba loans 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount service charges on deposit accounts gain on sale of loans loan related servicing income referral fee income loan packaging fee income from other earning assets other income total average assets noninterest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was the gain on the sale of loans  which slightly decreased to million in from million in and increased from million in the ratio of this income as a percentage of total noninterest income was   and in  and  respectively 
such changes were due mainly to the fluctuation of sales volume of the nonguaranteed portion of sba loans 
this non interest income is derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
we sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans in government securities secondary markets and retain servicing rights 
sba loan production levels were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as a result  the sales gains on the guaranteed portions of sba loans increased to million in as compared with million in and million in this source of non interest income also includes sales gains on nonguaranteed portion of sba loans and residential mortgage loans 
gain on sales of residential mortgage loans was   and  respectively  in  and however  the sale of the nonguaranteed portion of sba loans is not considered a stable source of income since the decision to sell the sba nonguaranteed portion is opportunistic and more related to our risk management strategy 
the gain on sale of the nonguaranteed portions of sba loans was  million  and  in   and  respectively 
our second largest source of noninterest income was service charge income on deposit accounts  representing   and of total noninterest income in   and  respectively 
this income source increased in to million  from million in  which previously increased from million in such increases were due primarily to an increase in our number of transactional accounts 
we imposed more rigid requirements on money service business msb accounts and more closely monitored their transactions 
as a result  the number of msb accounts was reduced and fee income therefrom was also reduced  limiting the increase of this revenue source relative to the increase of transactional accounts 
we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive position 
the third largest source of noninterest income was loan related servicing income 
this fee income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
significant reversals of servicing assets on sold loans  which were paid off before their maturities  decreased this income source to million in in  the growth of the servicing loan portfolio increased it to million as compared to million in the servicing fees on sold sba loans are credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing  and are charged by the monthly amortization of servicing assets that we capitalize upon sale of the related loan 
such servicing assets are also reversed and charged against the fee income account when the sold loans are paid off before the related servicing assets are fully amortized 
in  million of servicing assets were charged back to this income account by early pay offs as compared to  in in light of our increasing emphasis on trade financing activities and the continuing growth of our servicing loan portfolio million  million  and million at year end   and  respectively  management believes that this income source should continue to improve as prepayments on sba loans slow down 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our loan referral fee income source includes income derived from our referring to other financial institutions loans that did not meet our lending requirements for various reasons  including size  availability of funds  credit criteria and others 
our referral fee income in increased to  as compared with  in which previously decreased from  in we cannot assure you that this source of revenue will increase because loan referrals do not represent our core banking business and fee income therefrom is not a stable source of revenue 
loan packaging fee income  which represents charges to borrowers for their loan processing  increased to  in as compared with  in as the volume of loan production increased 
in  this income source had decreased from  in due to the increased competition that made waiving packaging fees more prevalent 
income on other earning assets represented income from earning assets other than interest earning assets  such as dividend income from fhlb stock ownership and the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
such income was   and  in  and  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to an additional purchase of million in bank owned life insurance in the second quarter of and the increased acquisition of fhlb stock as required by the new capital plan of the federal home loan bank of san francisco that went into effect on april  other income represented income from miscellaneous sources  such as gain on sale of investment securities and the excess of insurance proceeds over the carrying value of an insured loss 
other income decreased to million in from million in  which previously increased from  in the other income generally increases as our business activities grow  but it was unusually high in because of nonrecurring additional revenues recognized for a settlement award on an insurance claim and gain on sale call of investment securities 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in  from million in and million in these increases can be attributed to the expanded personnel and premises associated with our business growth  including the recent opening of new offices 
however  due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in and in management believes that its efforts in cost cutting and revenue diversification have improved our operational efficiency  as evidenced by the improvement in our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and total noninterest income to in from in  and in the following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated noninterest expense dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment data processing loan referral fee professional fees directors fees office supplies investor relation expenses advertising communications deposit insurance premium outsourced service for customers other total average assets noninterest expense as a of average assets salaries and employee benefits historically represent more than half of total noninterest expense and increased to million in as compared with million in which increased from million in despite the twelve branch and loan production office openings and significant asset growth in the past two years  we have taken efforts to promote efficient operations by limiting personnel growth 
the number of full time equivalent employees was at the end of  compared with and in and  respectively 
assets per employee increased to million at the end of from million and million at the end of and  respectively 
occupancy and equipment expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these cost increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our office network and the additions of new departments 
these expenses represented  and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
data processing expenses increased to million in from million in  which increased from million in  representing an increase of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
office supplies expenses also increased to  in from  in  and  in  representing an increase of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these increases in data processing expenses and office supplies correspond to the growth of our business 
loan referral fees are paid to brokers who refer loans  mostly sba loans  to us 
although we also paid referral fees for qualified commercial loans beginning in  the referral fee increases were mainly the result of increases in our sba loan production  since sba loans are broker driven loans 
due to the growth of sba loan production  these referral fees increased to million in  from million in and  in sba loan production increased to million in  from million in and million in professional fees generally may increase as we grow and we expect these expenditures will continue to be significant  as we address the enhanced sec and nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the local regulation of the states into which we recently commenced business operations 
professional fees were   and  or   and of total noninterest expense  in  and  respectively 
the professional fees in were exceptionally high because of the legal and accounting fees incurred to comply with the enhanced legal and accounting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act sox 
we also incurred additional professional fees in connection with the holding company reorganization in advertising expenses increased to  in from  in which previously increased from  in  representing   and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
such increases were attributable to expanded marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially for the opening of the dallas branch and new loan production offices 
outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services 
these expenses are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due mainly to the increase in service activities  these expenses have increased slightly to million in from million in in  these expenses increased from  in due to the increase in depositors  such as escrow accounts and brokerage accounts  demanding such services 
investor relations expenses represent costs for providing services to our existing or prospective shareholders  such as nasdaq listing fees  fees for an outside investor relations company and various promotional material costs 
these expenses have increased after in connection with the holding company reorganization in these expenses were   and  in   and  respectively 
noninterest expense  other than the categories specifically addressed above  increased by  or  to million in from million in in  noninterest expenses increased by  or  from million in the increases were mainly caused by the impairment charges of  in and  in of intangible assets 
in addition to the normal growth following the growth of our business activities 
the fair value of intangible assets  servicing assets and interest only strip which were capitalized at the time of sale of sba loans  were determined partially impaired in the periodic impairment testing 
generally  noninterest expense has increased from to as a result of rapid asset growth  and in  and  respectively  and the expansion of our office network and products  increases in staff  as well as additional occupancy and data processing costs 
management anticipates that noninterest expense will continue to increase as we continue to grow 
however  management remains committed to cost control and efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to our rate of growth 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we made a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for  and a provision of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rates in were consistent with those for prior years 
our effective tax rates were one to two percentage points lower than statutory rates due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone ez and our purchase of bank owned life insurance in and and low income housing tax credit funds in see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense accounts for the change in deferred tax assets liabilities from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in the financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
at december   and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a materially adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
financial condition loan portfolio total loans net of unearned income increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  total loans net of unearned income were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
total loans net of unearned income as a percentage of total assets were    and for    and  respectively 
real estate secured loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses thereon 
the properties may be either user owned or for investment purposes 
our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines set forth by the fdic 
the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  fair review of appraisal value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
loans secured by real estate equaled billion  million  million  million  and million as of december     and  respectively 
real estate secured loans as a percentage of total loans were    and at december     and  respectively 
since  we have been actively involved in residential mortgage lending 
we offer different types of home mortgage loans  sometimes with unconventional terms  such as interest only mortgages or option adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we usually sell most of the production  especially mortgage loans with unconventional terms  and only retain some portion of conventional mortgage loans on our books 
therefore  total home mortgage loan portfolio outstanding at the end of and was million and million  respectively  and we have deemed its effect on our credit risk profile to be immaterial 
the residential mortgage loans with unconventional terms such as interest only mortgages and option adjustable rate mortgages at the same periods were million and million  respectively  that were temporarily held for sale by us before sales or refinance 
the robust california real estate market in the past few years and our increased involvement in the residential mortgage loan market have further increased the volume of real estate secured loans 
commercial and industrial loans include revolving lines of credit  as well as term business loans 
this category also includes the retained portion of commercial sba loans 
with the success of our strategy to reduce reliance on sba loans and place an increased emphasis on non sba commercial loans  sba loans no longer represent the majority of our commercial and industrial loans 
commercial and industrial loans were million  million  million  million and million at the end of    and  respectively 
commercial and industrial loans were    and as a percentage of total loans at the end of    and  respectively 
consumer loans have historically represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans are concentrated in automobile loans  which we formerly provided as a service only to existing customers 
however  in  we initiated a business plan to increase our consumer loan portfolio  and introduced an auto loan center 
although consumer loans were million  million  million  million and million  at december     and  respectively  consumer loans as a percentage of total loans are still minimal 
management anticipates further increases in consumer loans going forward  although no assurance can be given that this increase will occur 
construction loans generally have represented or less of our total loan portfolio and are extended as a temporary financing vehicle only 
in the third quarter of  we formed a construction loan department by appointing a construction loan specialist as its manager 
we expect to expand our construction lending activities with this specialized capacity under the guidance of the commercial loan center 
our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans have typical maturities of three to five years and are extended to finance the purchase of business entities  business equipment  and leasehold improvements  or to provide permanent working capital 
sba guaranteed loans usually have longer maturities to years 
we generally limit real estate loan maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
we generally seek diversification in our loan portfolio  and our borrowers are diverse as to industry  location  and their current and target markets 
the following table sets forth the amount of total loans outstanding excluding unearned income and the percentage distributions in each category  as of the dates indicated distribution of loans and percentage composition of loan portfolio amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans  net of unearned income participation loans sold and serviced by the company construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans  net of unearned income the following table shows the contractual maturity distribution and repricing intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio as of december  in addition  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those with variable or floating interest rates and those with fixed or predetermined interest rates 
the table excludes the gross amount of non accrual loans of million  and includes unearned income and deferred fees totaling million at december  loan maturities and repricing schedule at december   within one year after one but within five years after five years total dollars in thousands construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans  net of unearned income loans with variable floating interest rates loans with predetermined fixed interest rates the majority of the properties taken as collateral are located in southern california 
the loans generated by our loan production offices  which are located outside of our main geographical market  are generally collateralized by property in close proximity to those offices 
we employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas 
since a major real estate recession during the first part of the previous decade  property values in southern california have generally increased 
however  no assurance can be given that this trend will continue or that property values will not significantly decrease 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of loans on non accrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans restructured  where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when they become days past due  unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
the past due loans may or may not be adequately collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some changes in financial status  causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and where we believe the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale 
our nonperforming loans decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of  despite the growth of our loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
management s continued emphasis on asset quality control has resulted in decreases in nonperforming loans in recent years 
the significant loan growth  together with the decrease of nonperforming loans  have caused the ratio of nonperforming loans over total loans to improve to and at december  and  respectively  as compared with  and at december   and  respectively 
at the end of  oreo was  which consisted of three properties foreclosed in we have already secured offers for these properties and management believes that we can sell them without a significant loss in we had no oreo at the end of  after the only oreo at the end of  a  single family residence  was sold with a negligible loss in early we had no oreo at december   after the sole oreo at the end of  a  unimproved land parcel was sold in together with oreo  the ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo improved for the past five years  equaling     and as of december     and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve provided for nonperforming loans  together with the tangible collateral  were adequate as of december  see allowance for loan losses below for further discussion 
except as disclosed above  as of december   management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms 
however  no assurance can be given that credit problems may exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management 
the following table provides information with respect to the components of our nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated the figures in the table are net of the portion guaranteed by the us government nonperforming assets at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total loans days or more past due and still accruing as to principal or interest construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total restructured loans  real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans allowance for loan losses in anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
the charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses above 
the substantial growth of our loan portfolio in the past five years has required more reserves for potential loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses increased by  or million  to million at december   as compared with million at december  such allowances were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
management s renewed emphasis on asset quality control has resulted in a lower level of net loan charge offs to   and  at the end of  and  respectively  and kept the level of nonperforming assets minimal despite the rapid growth of our loan portfolio 
as a result  we were able to lower the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans to  and at the end of  and  respectively 
management believes that the current ratio of is adequate because the level of total non performing loans as of december  was relatively low at of total loans 
prior to  the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial condition of a certain number of our clients and increased our net loan charge offs to million and million in and  respectively  and the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was and at the end of and  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended december   no interest income related to these loans was included in net income 
additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded during the year ended december   if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  or  if not outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december   since origination 
a restructured loan is one the terms of which were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
during the fiscal year ended december   approximately  of interest income related to this loan was included in net income 
additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  although management believes the allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future 
as of december  and  our allowance for loan losses consisted of amounts allocated from three phases of our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances  as follows see details of methodology for assessing allowance for loan losses in the section entitled critical accounting policies phase of methodology as of december  specific review of individual loans review of pools of loans with similar characteristics judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors the table below summarizes  for the periods indicated  loan balances at the end of each period  the daily averages during the period  changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged off  recoveries on loans previously charged off  additions to the allowance and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands balances average total loans outstanding during period total loans outstanding at end of period allowance for loan losses balances at beginning of period actual charge offs real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total charge offs recoveries on loans previously charged off real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total recoveries net loan charge offs provision for loan losses less provision for losses on off balance sheet item balance at end of period ratios net loan charge offs to average total loans allowance for loan losses to total loans at end of period net loan charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of period net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses the table below summarizes  for the periods indicated  the balance of the allowance for loan losses and the percentage of such balance for each type of loan as of the dates indicated distribution and percentage composition of allowance for loan losses amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands applicable to construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total allowance construction real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer total allowance contractual obligations the following table represents our aggregate contractual obligations principal and interest to make future payments as of december  dollars in thousands one year or less over one year to three years over three years to five years over five years total fhlb borrowings junior subordinated debenture operating leases time deposits total off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which represent a credit risk to us  are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and million  respectively 
obligations under standby letters of credit were million  million and million  for  and  respectively  and the obligations under commercial letters of credit were million  million and million for the same periods 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used 
as part of our asset and liability management strategy  we may engage in derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
in september  we entered into one interest rate swap agreement  under which we received a fixed rate and paid a variable rate based on the three month libor on the notional amount of million 
in january  the swap arrangement was terminated without any gain or loss by mutual agreement with the brokerage company 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various legal claims 
we have reviewed all legal claims against us with counsel and have taken into consideration the views of counsel as to the outcome of the claims 
in our opinion  the final disposition of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
investment activities investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a written comprehensive investment policy addressing strategies  types and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested 
as of december   and  we had million  million and million  respectively  in federal funds sold and repurchase agreements  and   and  respectively  in interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions 
investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk 
we classify our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale 
investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity securities  and all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income 
at december    and we had  million and million  respectively  in money market preferred stock mmps  which is classified as available for sale securities 
mmps is a form of equity security having characteristics similar to money market investments such as commercial paper and offers attractive tax equivalent yields with a dividend received deduction 
mmps is re auctioned every or days

as of december   held to maturity securities  which are carried at their amortized costs  decreased to million from million and million at december  and  respectively 
available for sale securities  which are stated at their fair market values  increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and  respectively 
these increases reflect a strategy of improving our liquidity level using available for sale securities  in addition to immediately available funds  the majority of which are maintained in the form of overnight investments

as of december   the total unrealized losses less than months old were  and total unrealized losses more than months old were  the aggregate related fair value of investments with unrealized losses less than months old was million at december   and those with unrealized losses more than months old were million 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we have the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held to maturity until they mature  at which time we expect to receive full value for the securities 
as of december  and  we also had the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as available for sale for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of cost 
the unrealized losses were largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
the fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or repricing date or if market yields for such investments decline 
we do not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality 
accordingly  as of december  and  we believe the impairments detailed in the table above were temporary  and no impairment loss has been realized in our consolidated statements of operations 
real estate investment trust on april   we established the wilshire capital trust  a maryland real estate investment trust  for the primary purpose of investing in our real estate related assets  and to enhance and strengthen our capital position  increase our earnings  and realize certain tax benefits 
we initially funded the trust with the contribution of million in real estate secured loans 
as of december   our trust had assets of approximately million 
the formation and capitalization of our real estate investment trust has had no substantial impact on our estimated tax accruals  since we determined not to recognize the proposed tax savings until realized 
in december  the state of california franchise tax board clarified its position and management believes that the proposed tax benefits through our subsidiary trust are no longer realizable in the future 
responding to this change  we dissolved the trust in march the dissolution of our trust did not or will not have a material impact on our existing or future operations 
other earning assets for various business purposes  we make investments in earning assets other than the interest earning securities discussed above 
before  the only other earning assets held by us were insignificant amounts of federal home loan bank stock and the cash surrender value of the bank owned life insurance boli 
in an effort to provide additional benefits aimed at retaining key employees  while generating a tax exempt noninterest income stream  we purchased million in in boli from insurance carriers rated aa or above 
in  we purchased million more in boli from the same insurance carriers 
we are the owner and the primary beneficiary of the life insurance policies and recognize the increase of the cash surrender value of the policies as tax exempt other income 
in  we also invested in two low income housing tax credit funds lihtcf to promote our participation in cra activities 
we committed to invest  over two to three years  a total of million to two different lihtcf million in apollo california tax credit fund xxii  lp  and million in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund  lp 
we anticipate receiving the return following this two to three year period in the form of tax credits and tax deductions over the next fifteen years 
the balances of other earning assets as of december  and december  were as follows type balance as of december  balance as of december  boli lihtcf federal home loan bank stock deposits and other sources of funds deposits deposits are our primary source of funds 
total deposits at december   and were billion  billion and million  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  in and million  or  in the average deposits for the years ended december   and were billion  million  and million  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  in  and of million  or  in in  our niche market depositor s preference in time deposits bearing relatively high interest rates decreased the level of deposits in transactional accounts 
our deposits in transactional accounts in decreased to of total deposit on an annual average basis  as compared with in in order to support our loan growth  we have increased our reliance on time deposits 
as a result  the annual average time deposits increased by in to million  whereas the annual average total deposits increased by only in to billion 
however  our continuing strategic emphasis on core deposits  which is defined as total deposits less time deposits in denominations of  or more  somewhat limited growth of time deposits at in on an annual average basis to million from million in whereas annual average total deposits increased in to million from million in our deposits in transactional accounts in increased to of total deposits from the s 
the average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of  or more increased to in as compared with in  which previously decreased from in see net interest income and net interest margin for further discussion

a number of clients carry deposit balances of more than of our total deposits  but only two customers  including the california state treasury  had a deposit balance of more than of total deposits in at december   the california state treasury was the only depositor whose deposit balance was more than of our total deposits 
in order to take advantage of historically low funding costs  in the past few years we also accepted brokered deposits on a selective basis at reasonable interest rates to augment deposit growth 
brokered deposits grew to million and million and at december  and  respectively  from million at the end of however  we have controlled this growth and reduced these deposits to million at december  in order to limit our reliance on non core funding sources 
most of the brokered deposits will mature within one year 
since brokered deposits are generally less stable forms of deposits  we closely monitor growth from this non core funding source 
fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the fhlb as an alternative to retail deposit funds 
since  we have increased borrowings from fhlb in order to take advantage of the flexibility of the program and its reasonably low cost 
see liquidity management below for the details on the fhlb borrowings program 
the following table is a summary of fhlb borrowings for fiscal years and dollars in thousands balance at year end average balance during the year maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate during the year average interest rate at year end junior subordinated debentures  trust preferred securities in december  the bank issued million of the junior subordinated debentures 
subsequently  the company  as a wholly owned subsidiary in and as a parent company of the bank in  issued a total of  of junior subordinated debentures in connection with a  trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly owned by the company 
bank level junior subordinated debenture 
in december  the bank issued a million junior subordinated debenture the debenture 
the interest rate payable on the debenture was at december   which rate adjusts quarterly to the three month libor plus 
the debenture will mature on december  interest on the debenture is payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
the bank may redeem the debenture in whole or in part prior to maturity on or after december  the debenture is treated as tier capital for bank regulatory capital purposes 
likewise  on a consolidated basis  the debenture also is treated as tier capital for company level capital purposes under current frb capital guidelines 
junior subordinated debenture  trust preferred securities issuance 
in december  wilshire bancorp was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank  in order to raise additional capital funds through the issuance of trust preferred securities 
prior to the completion of the august bank holding company reorganization  wilshire bancorp organized its wholly owned subsidiary  wilshire statutory trust i  which issued million in trust preferred securities 
wilshire bancorp then purchased all of the common interest in the wilshire statutory trust i  and issued the junior subordinated debenture the debenture in the amount of approximately million to the wilshire statutory trust i with terms substantially similar to the trust preferred securities in exchange for the proceeds from the issuance of the wilshire statutory trust i s trust preferred securities and common securities 
wilshire bancorp subsequently deposited the proceeds from the debenture in a depository account at the bank and infused million as additional equity capital to the bank immediately following the holding company reorganization 
the rate of interest on the debenture and related trust preferred securities was at december   which adjusts quarterly to the three month libor plus 
the debenture and related trust preferred securities will mature on december  the interest on both the debenture and related trust preferred securities is payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
wilshire bancorp may redeem the debenture and in turn the trust preferred securities in whole or in part prior to maturity on or after december  march junior subordinated debenture  trust preferred securities issuance 
in march  wilshire bancorp organized its wholly owned subsidiary  wilshire statutory trust ii  which issued million in trust preferred securities 
wilshire bancorp then purchased all of the common interest in the wilshire statutory trust ii  and issued the junior subordinated debenture the march debenture in the amount of million to the wilshire statutory trust ii with terms substantially similar to the march trust preferred securities in exchange for the proceeds from the issuance of the wilshire statutory trust ii s march trust preferred securities and common securities 
wilshire bancorp subsequently deposited the proceeds from the march debenture in a depository account at the bank and infused million as additional equity capital to the bank 
the rate of interest on the march debenture and related trust preferred securities was at december   which adjusts quarterly to the three month libor plus 
the march debenture and related trust preferred securities will mature on march  the interest on both the march debenture and related trust preferred securities are payable quarterly and no scheduled payments of principal are due prior to maturity 
wilshire bancorp may redeem the march debenture and in turn the trust preferred securities in whole or in part prior to maturity on or after march  september junior subordinated debenture  trust preferred securities issuance 
in september  wilshire bancorp organized its wholly owned subsidiary  wilshire statutory trust iii wilshire trust  which issued million in trust preferred securities 
wilshire statutory trust iii  a subsidiary of wilshire bancorp  purchased million of wilshire bancorp s junior subordinated debt securities the september debenture  payable in until september   the securities will be fixed at a annual interest rate  thereafter converting to a floating rate of three month libor plus  resetting quarterly 
wilshire bancorp may defer the payment of interest at any time for a period up to twenty consecutive quarters  provided the deferral period does not extend past the stated maturity 
except upon the occurrence of certain events resulting in a change in the capital treatment or tax treatment of the subordinated debentures or resulting in wilshire trust being deemed to be an investment company required to register under the investment company act of  we may not redeem the subordinated debentures until after september payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust preferred securities are guaranteed by wilshire bancorp 
the junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holder of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits 
under the final rule  bank holding companies may include trust preferred securities in tier capital in an amount together with other restricted core capital elements equal to of the sum of core capital elements including restricted core capital elements net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts in excess of these limits will generally be included in tier capital 
for purposes of this rule  restricted core capital elements are generally to be comprised of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  minority interest related to qualifying common stock or qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a us depository institution or a foreign bank and qualifying trust preferred securities 
the final rule provides a transition period for bank holding companies to come into compliance with these new capital restrictions 
accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies will have until september  an extension of the september  transition period under the proposed rule to come into compliance with the final rule s capital restrictions due to the transition period 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule 
under the final rule  as of december   wilshire bancorp counted million of total trust preferred securities as tier capital  leaving million as tier capital 
asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity management maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  deposits in other financial institutions and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was  and at december   and  respectively 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we rely on advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our mortgage loans and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and low cost  we limit our use to of borrowing capacity  as such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was about million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to million and million in federal funds with bank of the west and union bank of california  respectively 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
at december   total shareholders equity increased to million from million at december   representing an increase of million  primarily from internally generated operating income of million  the  in proceeds from stock option exercises and the million in tax benefits therefrom  which was reduced by the declared cash dividends of million in 
at december   total shareholders equity increased to million from million  representing an increase of million  primarily from internally generated operating income of million  million in proceeds from stock option exercises and the million in tax benefits therefrom 
as of december   we had million in junior subordinated debentures 
the million was issued in relation with the issuance of million trust preferred securities 
in addition  in march and september of  we issued a total of million in junior subordinated debentures to the wilshire statutory trusts  our wholly owned subsidiaries  which in turn issued the trust preferred securities of the total of million 
we subsequently infused million as an additional equity capital to the bank in march as of december  and  million was treated as our tier i capital  but the remaining million which was issued by the bank was treated as our tier ii capital 
at december   our holding of junior subordinated debentures increased to million in relation with the issuance of million trust preferred securities 
as a result  our tier i capital and tier capital further increased at the end of by million and million  respectively 
for the bank level  the tier capital also increased by million with the capital infusion 
see deposits and other sources of funds for further discussion regarding the capital treatment of subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to our capital ratios as of the dates specified for wilshire bancorp  inc and wilshire state bank wilshire bancorp  inc actual ratios for the company as of regulatory well capitalized standards regulatory adequately capitalized standards december  december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to adjusted average assets wilshire state bank actual ratios for the bank as of regulatory well capitalized standards regulatory adequately capitalized standards december  december  december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to adjusted average assets recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june  thus  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r effective january  in adopting sfas no 
r  we may apply the modified prospective application method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r 
alternatively  we may apply the modified retrospective application  which would require the recording of compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period restated 
we adopted the new standard effective january  using the modified prospective method and we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to result in amounts that are materially different from the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
stock option expense for fiscal is estimated to be  net of tax  which may change as a result of future stock option grants  forfeitures and or other items 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 voluntary changes in accounting principles are applied retrospectively to prior periods financial statements unless it would be impractical 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 which required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of a change in accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption sfas no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of our operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investment 
this fsp nullified certain requirements of emerging issues tasks force  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and references existing other than temporary guidance 
furthermore  this fsp creates a three step process in determining when an investment is considered impairment  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss the implementation of the fsp no 
fas and fas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp statement of position sop  terms of loan products that may give rise to a concentration of credit risk  which addresses the circumstances under which the terms of loan products give rise to such risk and the disclosures or other accounting considerations that apply for entities that originate  hold  guarantee  service  or invest in loan products with terms that may give rise to a concentration of credit risk 
the guidance under this fsp is effective for interim and annual periods ending after december  and for loan products that are determined to represent a concentration of credit risk  disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  should be provided for all periods presented 
the adoption of this fsp did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this statement also resolves issues addressed in statement implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
sfas no 
eliminates the exemption from applying sfas no 
to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments 
sfas no 
also allows a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition  at issuance  or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement new basis event  on an instrument by instrument basis  in case in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we do not expect the adoption sfas no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements or results of our operations 
impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us by its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
management evaluates market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management committee alco  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  alco may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities and the use of derivatives 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation and monitoring of earnings to provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize monthly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value sensitivity of the balance sheet 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets in a given time period  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we normally seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest margin stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of loans and investment securities and deposits available to be repriced within one year 
at december   we were asset sensitive  with a positive cumulative one year gap of million or of total assets 
in general  based upon our mix of deposits  loans and investments  increases in interest rates would be expected to increase our net interest margin 
decreases in interest rates would be expected to have the opposite effect  which was the case in a few years prior to june  we intentionally maintain a significant three month positive gap of million or of total assets 
this positive gap is strategically planned to meet any unanticipated funding needs by maintaining a large portion of funds obtained from non interest bearing deposits in overnight investments and other cash equivalents 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates earned or paid changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate gaps reported in the tables arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
since these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the alco also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
the npv is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments accounting for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns 
interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  amounts subject to repricing within months months years after years total interest earning assets dollars in thousands gross loans investment securities federal funds sold and cash equivalents agreement to resell interest earning deposits total interest bearing liabilities savings deposits time deposits of  or more other time deposits other interest bearing deposits other borrowings subordinate debentures total interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio based on total assets excludes the gross amount of non accrual loans of approximately million at december  the following table sets forth our estimated net interest income over a twelve months period and npv based on the indicated changes in market interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands change net interest income in basis points next twelve months change npv change although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value under immediate rising or falling market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect for the reasonably possible worst scenario 
the alco policy prescribes that  for the worst possible rate drop scenario  the possible reduction of net interest income and npv  not to exceed of the base net interest income and of the base npv 
as indicated above  the net interest income increases decreases as market interest rates rise fall  since we are positively gapped by million for a time horizon of one year 
this is also due to the fact that a substantial portion of the interest earning assets reprice immediately after the rate change  that interest bearing liabilities reprice slower than interest earning assets and that interest bearing liabilities do not reprice to the same degree as interest earning assets  given a stated change in the interest rate 
the npv increases decreases as the interest income increases decreases since the change in the cash flows has a greater impact on the change in the npv than does the change in the discount rate 
management believes that the assumptions used by it to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
our strategies in protecting both net interest income and economic value of equity from significant movements in interest rates involve restructuring our investment portfolio and using fhlb advances 
we also permit the purchase of rate caps and floors  and engaging in interest rate swaps  although we have not yet engaged in either of these activities  other than an interest rate swap agreement arranged in september on the notional amount of million and subsequently terminated without any gain or loss by mutual agreement between us and a brokerage company in january
