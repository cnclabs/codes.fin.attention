item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in reviewing this item  attention is directed to item  selected financial data  and item  business 
overview the principal goal of wesco s management is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
nor do fluctuations in annual net income 
to accomplish desired growth  a high priority is placed on the purchases of companies having excellent economic characteristics  run by outstanding managers 
management strives also to invest in common stocks of outstanding publicly traded companies at prices deemed reasonable 
in the event that such investments are not available  as has often been the case in recent years  capital is preserved through investments principally in high quality cash equivalents and securities of the us government and its agencies 
wesco s operating businesses are managed on a decentralized basis 
there are essentially no centralized or integrated business functions such as sales  marketing  purchasing  legal or human resources and there is minimal involvement by wesco s management in the day to day business activities of the operating businesses 
wesco s chairman  president and chief executive officer  charles t 
munger  is also vice chairman of berkshire  and consults with warren e 
buffett  chairman and chief executive officer of berkshire  with respect to wesco s investment decisions  major capital allocations  and the selection of the chief executives to head each of wesco s operating units  subject to ultimate approval of wesco s board of directors 
the operations of wesco s wesco financial insurance company wes fic subsidiary are managed by berkshire hathaway s national indemnity company nico subsidiary 
wes fic participates principally in reinsurance contracts in which nico and other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate in the reinsurance of property and casualty risks of unaffiliated insurance companies 
terms of wes fic s participation are essentially identical to those by which the other berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiaries participate  except as to the percentages of participation see item  business  for further information 
financial information relative to these participations appearing in item  selected financial data  and in wesco s consolidated financial statements  is identified as affiliated business 
financial condition wesco continues to have a strong balance sheet at december   with relatively low debt and no hedging 
liquidity  which has traditionally been high  has been even higher than usual for the past three years following sales  maturities and redemptions of fixed maturity investments  the proceeds from which have not yet been reinvested for the long term 
wesco s equity investments are in strong  well known companies 
the practice of concentrating in a few issues  rather than diversifying  follows the investment philosophy of the chairmen ceos of wesco and its parent  berkshire hathaway  who consult with respect to wesco s investments and major capital allocations 
results of operations wesco s consolidated net income for included realized investment gains of million million  after income taxes resulting principally from the exchange of common shares of the gillette company gillette for common shares of the procter gamble company pg in connection with pg s acquisition of gillette in the fourth quarter of realized investment gains or losses have been an element of wesco s net income for a number of years 
the varying effect upon wesco s pre tax and net income is evident on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
the amount of realized gain or loss has no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period have no practical analytical value  particularly in view of the existence of substantial unrealized price appreciation in wesco s consolidated investment portfolio at each balance sheet date 
wesco s after tax income  excluding realized investment gains  increased by million for the year  due mainly to improved operating results of the furniture rental business and increased investment income earned by the insurance businesses  partially offset by decreased net underwriting gains 
financial condition wesco s shareholders equity at december  was billion per share  up million from the billion per share at december  wesco s consolidated balance sheet reflects investments carried at fair values  with unrealized appreciation  net of deemed applicable income taxes  included as a component of shareholders equity 
upon completion of pg s acquisition of gillette on october   the after tax gain of million  which had been included in the unrealized gain component at september   was reclassified to retained earnings  another component of wesco s shareholders equity 
principally as a result  unrealized appreciation declined from of wesco s shareholders equity at december   to at december  these changes have no significant economic effect 
wesco s consolidated borrowings totaled million at december  versus million at december  of these amounts  million and million related to a million revolving line of credit used in cort s furniture rental business 
in addition to this recorded debt  wesco and its subsidiaries had million of operating lease and other contractual obligations at december   up from million one year earlier 
see the section on off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations appearing below in this item  as well as note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  for additional information on debt 
wesco s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  totaled million versus million at december  wes fic enjoys standard poor s corporation s highest rating  aaa  with respect to its claims paying ability 
results of operations wesco s reportable business segments are organized in a manner that reflects how wesco s top management views those business activities 
wesco s management views insurance businesses as possessing two distinct operations underwriting and investing  and believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of their financial performance 
underwriting gain or loss represents the simple arithmetic difference between the following line items appearing on the consolidated statement of income insurance premiums earned  less insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses  and insurance underwriting expenses 
management s goal is to generate underwriting gains over the long term 
underwriting results are evaluated without allocation of investment income 
the consolidated data in the second table in item are set forth essentially in the income statement format customary to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenues  including realized net securities gains  are followed by costs and expenses  and a provision for income taxes  to arrive at net income 
the following summary sets forth the after tax contribution to gaap net income of each business segment insurance  furniture rental and industrial as well as activities not considered related to such segments 
realized net securities gains are excluded from segment activities  consistent with the way wesco s management views the business operations 
amounts are in thousands  all after income tax effect 
year ended december  insurance segment underwriting investment income furniture rental segment industrial segment nonsegment items other than investment gains realized investment gains consolidated net income in the following sections the data set forth in the foregoing summary on an after tax basis are broken down and discussed 
insurance segment wesco engages in both primary insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks through wesco financial insurance company wes fic and the kansas bankers surety company kbs 
their operations are conducted or supervised by wholly owned subsidiaries of berkshire hathaway inc berkshire hathaway  wesco s ultimate parent company 
in reinsurance activities  defined portions of similar or dissimilar risks that other insurers or reinsurers have subjected themselves to in their own insuring activities are assumed 
in primary insurance activities  defined portions of the risks of loss from persons or organizations that are directly subject to the risks are assumed 
for purposes of the following discussion  the results have been disaggregated between reinsurance and primary insurance activities 
following is a summary of the insurance segment s underwriting activities 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  insurance premiums written reinsurance primary total insurance premiums earned reinsurance primary total insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses underwriting gain  before income taxes reinsurance primary total income taxes underwriting gain under the aviation related contracts  written premiums for  and totaled million  million and million and earned premiums were million  million and million 
of the increases of in aviation related written premiums and in earned premiums for  slightly higher volume and improved pricing were responsible for about half  the entry into the workers compensation pool in accounted for the remainder 
the decreases of in written and in earned aviation related premiums for were attributable mainly to increased competition 
prices in certain aviation markets declined  resulting in fewer opportunities to write business at prices considered acceptable 
reinsurance activities have fluctuated from year to year 
the level of business written in future periods will vary  perhaps materially  based upon market conditions and management s assessment of the adequacy of premium rates 
until late  wes fic participated in a multi year contract covering certain multi line property and casualty risks of a large  unaffiliated insurer under a contract entered into in that contract was commuted in the fourth quarter of  at which time wes fic paid the ceding company million  representing all unearned premiums  reduced by unamortized costs and expenses 
after the commutation  wes fic s obligation to indemnify with respect to any further insurance losses under the contract ceased 
under the contract  there was a net reduction in written premiums of million for  compared with written premiums of million for  earned premiums were million and million  respectively 
volume of premiums written and earned under that contract in before its commutation were significantly lower than in due principally to the imposition of tighter underwriting standards with respect to business written 
written primary insurance increased million for and million for these increases were principally due to growth in volume of bank deposit guarantee bonds  this product currently accounts for approximately of wes fic s primary insurance business 
earned premiums from primary insurance increased million for and million for due mainly to the increase in written premiums for deposit guarantee bonds 
premiums are amortized into income ratably over the coverage period  and  therefore  there is often a difference in the relative fluctuation in written versus earned premium from year to year 
liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are recorded based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under the contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
depending on the type of loss being estimated  the timing and amount of loss payments are subject to a great degree of variability and are contingent  among other factors  upon the timing of the claim reporting by cedants and insureds  and the determination and payment of the ultimate loss amounts through the loss adjustment process 
significant judgments and assumptions are necessary in projecting the ultimate amounts payable in the future with respect to loss events that have occurred 
claims that have occurred as of the balance sheet date have not all been reported  and if reported may not have been settled 
the time between the occurrence date and payment date of a loss is referred to as the claim tail 
property claims usually have fairly short claim tails  and  absent litigation  are reported and settled within no more than a few years after occurrence 
casualty losses usually have very long claim tails 
casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment  which contributes to extended claim tails 
claim tails for reinsurers may be further extended due to delayed reporting by ceding insurers or reinsurers due to contractual provisions or reporting practices 
the loss and loss expense reserves reflected on the consolidated balance sheet include provision for those claims that have been reported referred to as case reserves and for those claims that have not been reported  referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
actual ultimate loss amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates  referred to as loss development  are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
wes fic and kbs do not use consultants to assist in reserving activities 
reinsurance wes fic s property and casualty loss reserves derive from individual risk  multi line and catastrophe reinsurance policies 
reserve amounts are based upon loss estimates reported by ceding companies  whose reserving techniques vary 
wes fic necessarily relies in part on the judgment of ceding companies management  to which wes fic management may add additional ibnr reserves  which are primarily a function of reported losses from ceding companies and anticipated loss ratios established on an individual contract basis based on wes fic management s judgment as to the likely impact on each contract of major events as they become known or the history of loss reserving by the ceding companies 
ceding companies report minimal detail to their reinsurers  such as data about most individual claims  case and ibnr reserves  dismissals and settlements 
ranges of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions are not prepared 
primary insurance property and casualty loss reserves from wesco s primary insurance activities derive from individual risk policies written by kbs 
reserve amounts are estimated by its management on a case by case basis  and estimates of ibnr reserves  which amounted to million at yearend  and  are based on management s judgment of the impact of current trends and other factors 
because of the low volume of losses reported annually  kbs management is intimately familiar with each  negating the need for extended actuarial studies and broad estimates of the nature typically performed by large primary insurers whose business volume requires such procedures for the development of their loss data 
a range of reserve amounts as a result of changes in underlying assumptions is not prepared 
for  and  reinsurance generated underwriting gains of million  million and million  before income taxes 
the figure reflects estimated losses of million related to hurricane katrina  which struck the gulf coast of the united states in the third quarter 
included in the figure was a pre tax underwriting gain of million including million in the fourth quarter associated with the aforementioned commuted contract as well as an estimated loss of million relating to hurricanes that struck the southeastern united states that year 
the underwriting gain for is net of a pre tax underwriting loss of million associated with the commuted contract 
excluding underwriting results attributable to the commuted contract  pre tax underwriting gains from reinsurance amounted to million  million and million for  and these figures include favorable unfavorable reserve development of million for  attributable to the aviation related contracts  million for  consisting of favorable development of million relating to a contract whose coverage period expired in  less million of unfavorable aviation related development  and million for  representing million of unfavorable development under the aviation related contracts  partially offset by million of favorable development relating principally to the contract whose coverage period expired in management believes that underwriting gain or loss is an important measure of financial performance of insurance companies 
when stated as a percentage  the sum of insurance losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses  divided by premiums  gives the combined ratio 
a combined ratio of less than connotes an underwriting profit and a combined ratio of greater than connotes an underwriting loss 
excluding the results from the contract commuted in  combined ratios from reinsurance activities were  and for  and  which management considers to have been favorable 
underwriting results from primary insurance have also been favorable but have fluctuated from year to year as shown in the preceding table  due to timing and volatility of losses incurred 
in  pre tax underwriting results improved by million  after having declined by million for kbs combined ratios  net of unfavorable loss development of million each for and  and million for  were  and for those respective years 
wesco s insurers cede minimal amounts of business  and as a result underwriting results may be volatile 
instead of paying reinsurers substantial amounts to minimize risks associated with significant losses  management accepts volatility in underwriting results provided the prospects of long term underwriting profitability remain favorable 
in addition  reinsurance recoverables may ultimately prove to be uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify its own policyholders 
the income tax provision associated with the insurance segment s underwriting activities for benefited by million relating to the resolution of an issue raised in an examination of prior year income tax returns by the internal revenue service 
since september   the insurance industry has been particularly concerned about its exposure to claims resulting from acts of terrorism 
it should be noted that the commutation of the multi line property and casualty contract in resulted in the return to the ceding company of all remaining liability relating to the terrorist activity of september  in spite of partial relief provided to the insurance industry by the terrorism risk insurance act  enacted in and amended by the terrorism risk extension act of  wes fic is exposed to insurance losses from terrorist events 
although wes fic s and thus wesco s exposure to such losses from an insurance standpoint cannot be predicted  management does not believe it likely that  on a worst case basis  wesco s shareholders equity would be severely impacted by future terrorism related insurance losses under reinsurance or insurance contracts currently in effect 
other industry concerns in recent years have been exposures to losses relating to environmental contamination and asbestos 
management currently believes such exposures to be minimal 
following is a summary of investment income produced by wesco s insurance segment in thousands of dollars 
year ended december  investment income  before taxes income taxes investment income  after taxes investment income of the insurance segment comprises dividends and interest earned principally from the investment of shareholder capital including reinvested earnings as well as float principally  premiums received before payment of related claims and expenses 
pre tax investment income for increased million  or  from the corresponding figure principally due to higher interest rates earned on short term investments in pre tax investment income declined million  or in from the corresponding figure principally because proceeds from sales  maturities and early redemptions of long term  fixed maturity investments during the first half of were reinvested in lower yielding  short term investments and cash equivalents 
the increases in short term interest rates in the united states since mid should result in increased earnings from such investments in periods when compared to periods 
management continues to seek to invest cash balances in the purchase of businesses and in long term equity holdings 
however  absent such opportunities  investment income may remain relatively low 
wesco s insurance subsidiaries  as a matter of practice  maintain liquidity in amounts which exceed by wide margins expected near term requirements for payment of claims and expenses 
as a result  it would be unlikely that any unanticipated payment of claims or expenses would require the liquidation of investments at a loss 
wesco does not attempt to match long term investment maturities to estimated durations of claim liabilities 
reference is made to the table of contractual obligations appearing elsewhere in this item for an indication of the periods in which the insurance segment s losses and loss expenses are expected to be paid 
furniture rental segment following is a summary of the results of operations of cort business services corporation cort  wesco s furniture rental segment 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues furniture rentals furniture sales apartment locator fees cost of rentals  sales and fees selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense income loss before income taxes and minority interest income taxes minority interest in net loss of subsidiary segment net income loss furniture rental revenues for increased million  or  from those of  after being relatively flat from those reported for the previous year 
excluding million  million and million of rental revenues from trade shows and locations not in operation throughout each year  rental revenues for increased from those of  this followed a decline of approximately in the preceding year 
the number of furniture leases at yearend was about lower than at yearend after having increased about from year end despite the net decrease in furniture leases at the end of  attributed mainly to non renewals by customers of a competitor acquired in the latter half of  the average rental revenue received per unit leased increased 
management is cautiously optimistic about further improvements in the furniture business 
furniture sales revenues increased in after decreases of and in and from those of each previous year 
the increase is attributed principally to continued efforts to reduce inventory 
apartment locator fees for decreased million  or  from those reported for  after decreasing million or from those for since late in  the apartment locator operations have undergone reorganization in order to reduce operating losses 
some of their walk in facilities have been merged into the furniture rental facilities  and others have been closed  resulting in significant cost and expense reductions 
the reduction in revenues has been more than offset by a reduction in related costs and expenses 
cost of rentals  sales and fees amounted to of revenues for versus for and for the decrease in costs as a percentage of revenues is principally due to revenue growth and an improvement in revenue mix  with a larger percentage of revenue coming from furniture rental  which has a higher margin than furniture retail 
costs of generating apartment locator fees were million in  down from million in and million in excluding such costs  segment costs for furniture rentals and sales were in  in and in selling  general  administrative and interest expenses operating expenses for the segment were million for  up from the million incurred for  following a decrease of from the million incurred for total operating expenses remained relatively stable  even with the growth of revenues  due to aggressive restructuring of the apartment locator related expenses  employee headcount management  and substantial improvements in occupancy expenses  offset by an increase in transportation and storage costs primarily associated with the increase in the cost of fuel 
included in the operating expenses are apartment locator related expenses of million in  an reduction from the million recorded in  which declined from million in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in and in furniture rental segment net income amounted to million in  versus million in and a loss of million in the million improvement is principally associated with the increase in revenues and the continued focus on reducing operating expenses 
the furniture segment s tax provision and net income for the year ended december  benefited by million relating to an adjustment of a prior year tax reserve 
the minority interest in net loss of subsidiary of million in relates to a period of several months during which the apartment locator operation was an owned subsidiary of cort 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
hurricanes katrina and rita  which occurred late in the third quarter of the current year  are believed not to have materially affected the furniture rental segment based on information currently available 
industrial segment following is a summary of the results of operations of the industrial segment  consisting of the businesses of precision steel and its subsidiaries 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  revenues  principally sales and services income loss before income taxes income taxes segment net income loss for several years prior to  the operations of the industrial segment suffered due to various factors including the following a prolonged economic downturn  a shift of production by many manufacturers from domestic to overseas facilities  periodic shortages of product from domestic mills  and extraordinary competitive pressures 
not only was there a decline in the number of orders placed  but there was also a trend towards smaller sized orders 
the severity of the impact on the business is demonstrated by the fact that average annual segment revenues for the years through were down from those reported for through at the beginning of  a shortage of raw materials from domestic mills produced near chaos in the steel service industry 
customers wishing to avoid running out of stock accelerated their purchasing  exacerbating the tumult 
as the year progressed  domestic steel mills were operating at capacity and imported steel was not readily available 
these and other factors enabled the mills to raise prices  place limits on order quantities and extend delivery times 
precision steel reacted by passing the price increases  plus normal mark ups  on to its customers 
thus  for the year  pounds of steel products sold increased and segment revenues increased million  pre tax and net income increased million and million  respectively 
throughout  supplies of product from domestic mills have become more readily available  demand has softened  competitive pressures have increased  and mills have lowered prices  although such prices remain approximately higher than they were two years earlier 
segment revenues for increased million  or  from those of  despite a year to year decrease in pounds of steel sold 
for  pre tax and net income increased million and million  respectively 
precision steel s cost of products sold percentage is very sensitive to current changes in the cost of materials purchased  because it carries its inventories at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market  under this method  the most recent costs are reflected in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold included adverse lifo inventory accounting adjustments of million million  after income taxes for and million million  after income taxes for lifo adjustments were insignificant for despite these adjustments  cost of sales  which have tended to fluctuate from year to year  amounted to  and of revenues for those years  reflecting mainly customers acceptance of price increase in view of the metal shortages 
despite improved results in and  management is concerned that the steel warehouse business may revert to the difficult times that prevailed prior to as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  precision steel and a subsidiary are involved in environmental litigation  the ultimate cost of which is difficult to estimate 
the foregoing segment operating results reflect estimated costs plus legal fees for this matter for each of the past three years  less insurance reimbursements received in the two most recent years  as follows a net benefit of million million  after taxes for  net costs of million million  after taxes for  and costs of million million  after taxes for had it not been for the costs incurred in connection with the environmental matter in and  pre tax and net income reported for the industrial segment for would not have differed significantly from those of  however  for  the pre tax and net losses reported by the industrial segment would have been million and million  respectively 
management anticipates that additional provisions and legal fees with respect to environmental remediation may be required in the future 
however  as of december   it was not possible to reasonably estimate the amount  if any  of additional costs or a range of costs  that may be required in connection with the matter 
although management does not anticipate that the ultimate impact of such provisions and costs  net of future insurance recoveries  if any  will be material in relation to wesco s shareholders equity  it believes that the effect on industrial segment and consolidated net income in any given period could be material 
unrelated to business segment operations set forth below is a summary of items increasing decreasing wesco s consolidated net income that are viewed by management as unrelated to the operations of the insurance  furniture rental and industrial segments 
amounts are in thousands 
year ended december  realized investment gains  before income tax effect income taxes realized investment gains other nonsegment items rental income from commercial real estate dividend and interest income real estate and general and administrative expenses other items  net income before income taxes income taxes net income from other nonsegment activities management s principal goal is to maximize gain in wesco s intrinsic business value per share over the long term 
accounting consequences do not influence business decisions 
there is no particular strategy as to the timing of sales of investments 
investments may be sold for a variety of reasons  including the belief that prospects for future appreciation of a particular investment are less attractive than the prospects for reinvestment of the after tax proceeds from its sale  or the desire to generate funds for an acquisition or repayment of debt 
investment gains may also derive from non cash exchanges of securities for other investment securities as a result of merger activity involving the investees 
wesco s consolidated earnings contained net realized investment gains of million million  after taxes in and million million  after taxes in  no gains or losses were realized in of the figure  million  after taxes  resulted from wesco s non cash exchange of common shares of the gillette company gillette for common shares of the procter gamble company pg in connection with the purchase of gillette by pg in the fourth quarter 
the million excess of fair value of the shares exchanged over wesco s original cost basis was recorded by wesco as a realized investment gain on october  the date of the transaction  as required under generally accepted accounting principles 
although the gain had a material impact on wesco s reported earnings for the fourth quarter of  there was no effect on shareholders equity 
wesco carried its investment in gillette at market value with unrealized gains reflected  net of potential income tax effect  in the net unrealized appreciation component of its shareholders equity  as of september  federal income taxes are not currently payable as a result of the exchange 
other nonsegment items include mainly rental income from owned commercial real estate and dividend and interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents owned outside the insurance subsidiaries  reduced by real estate and general and administrative expenses plus or minus income taxes related to such items 
these taxes do not typically correlate well with total pre tax income  primarily because dividend income is taxed at a very low rate 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  wesco and its ms property company subsidiary reduced their liabilities for deferred income taxes by an aggregate of million 
that amount is reflected as a reduction of income tax expense of activities unrelated to business segments  shown in the preceding table  as well as an increase in after tax income  for the fourth quarter as well as the year 
consolidated revenues  expenses and net income reported for any period are not necessarily indicative of future revenues  expenses and net income in that they are subject to significant variations in amount and timing of investment gains and losses  as well as other unusual nonoperating items such as a large acquisition 
in addition  consolidated revenues  expenses and net income are subject to external conditions such as the september  terrorist activity  which had an immediate impact on wes fic s underwriting results  and changes in the economy  which have significantly affected cort and precision steel in recent years 
wesco is not now suffering from inflation  but its business operations have potential exposure  particularly in the insurance and industrial segments 
large unanticipated changes in the rate of inflation could adversely impact the insurance business  because premium rates are established well in advance of expenditures 
precision steel s businesses are competitive and operate on tight gross profit margins  making their earnings susceptible to inflationary and deflationary cost changes  the impact  though not material in relation to wesco s consolidated net income  may be significant to that of the industrial segment  due particularly to the segment s use of lifo inventory accounting 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations neither wesco nor any of its subsidiaries has off balance sheet arrangements other than the unrecorded contractual obligations discussed below 
nor do they have any insurance obligations for which estimated provisions have not been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements or notes thereto 
wesco and its subsidiaries have contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities  which will result in cash payments in future periods 
certain of those obligations  such as notes payable  are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  wesco and its subsidiaries have entered into long term contracts to acquire goods or services in the future  which are not currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements and will be reflected in future periods as the goods are delivered or services provided 
a summary of contractual obligations follows 
amounts are in thousands 
payments due total subsequently notes payable  including interest operating lease obligations payment of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses purchase obligations  other than for capital expenditures construction of condominiums other  principally deferred compensation totals amounts and timing of payments are significantly dependent on estimates 
see critical accounting policies and practices below 
critical accounting policies and practices wesco s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the significant accounting policies and practices followed by wesco are set forth in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
following are the accounting policies and practices considered by wesco s management to be critical to the determination of consolidated financial position and results of operations 
use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the period reported upon 
in particular  estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim amounts that will be reported and settled over a period of many years 
the estimates and assumptions are based on management s evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances using information available at the time such estimates and assumptions are made 
the amounts of such assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses included in the consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from those that might result from use of estimates and assumptions based on facts and circumstances not yet available 
although wesco s management does not believe such changes in estimates would have a materially adverse effect on shareholders equity  they could produce a material effect on results of operations in a reporting period 
investments the appropriate classifications of investments in securities with fixed maturities and marketable equity securities are established at the time of purchase and reevaluated as of each balance sheet date 
there are three permissible classifications held to maturity  trading  and  when neither of those classifications is applicable  available for sale 
in recent years  all equity and fixed maturity investments have been classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of applicable deferred income taxes  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
rental furniture rental furniture consists principally of residential and office furniture which is available for rental or  if no longer up to rental standards or excessive in quantity  for sale 
rental furniture is carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation calculated primarily on a declining balance basis over to years using estimated salvage values of to percent of original cost 
revenue recognition insurance premiums are recognized as earned revenues in proportion to the insurance protection provided  which in most cases is pro rata over the term of each contract 
unearned insurance premiums are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
certain costs of acquiring premiums are deferred in other assets on wesco s consolidated balance sheet  and charged to income as the premiums are earned 
furniture rentals are recognized as revenue proportionately over the rental contract period  rentals received in advance are deferred in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
related costs comprise the main element of cost of products and services sold on the consolidated income statement and include depreciation expense  repairs and maintenance and inventory losses 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon passage of title to the customer  which coincides with product shipment  delivery or acceptance  depending on the sales arrangement 
losses and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates of the ultimate amounts payable under property and casualty reinsurance and insurance contracts related to losses occurring on or before the balance sheet date 
as of that date  some incurred claims have not yet been reported and some of these may not be reported for many years  the liability for unpaid losses includes significant estimates for these claims 
liabilities for insurance losses are determined from individual case amounts  reports from ceding insurers  and past experience 
considerable judgment is required to evaluate claims and estimate claims liabilities in connection with reinsurance contracts because of the inherent delays in receiving loss information from ceding companies 
as further data become available  the liabilities are reevaluated and adjusted as appropriate 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and some take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
actual ultimate claims amounts are likely to differ from amounts recorded at the balance sheet date 
changes in estimates are recorded as a component of losses incurred in the period of change 
provisions for losses and loss adjustment expenses are reported in the consolidated statement of income after deducting estimates of amounts that will be recoverable under reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding companies of their obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance contracts 
goodwill goodwill of acquired businesses represents the excess of the cost of acquired entities principally cort over the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
annual impairment tests are performed in the fourth quarter of each year using a variety of methods that require that certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding economic factors and future profitability 
impairments  if any  are charged to earnings 
prior to  gaap required the amortization of goodwill 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet contains substantial amounts of investments whose estimated fair carrying values are subject to market risks 
values of marketable equity securities are subject to fluctuations in their stock market prices  and values of securities with fixed maturities are subject to changes in interest rate levels 
apart from investments  the consolidated balance sheet at december  did not contain significant assets or liabilities with values subject to these or other potential market exposures such as those relating to changes in commodity prices or foreign exchange rates 
wesco does not utilize derivatives to manage market risks 
equity price risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of marketable equity securities stated at market value  up from million one year earlier 
the increase was due to an increase in market values as well as the purchase of securities at cost of million during the carrying values of wesco s equity securities are exposed to market price fluctuations  which may be accentuated by the concentration existing in the equity portfolio 
at december   two investments comprised of the carrying value of the consolidated equity portfolio 
in addition  the businesses represented by the equity investments are exposed to risks related to other markets 
the two largest holdings of the consolidated group at december  million  combined were common stocks of the coca cola company and the procter and gamble company  both of which have global operations and thus are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these and other market risks to which these investees are subject  such as commodity price fluctuations  are required  where material  to be reported upon in the filings these companies make with the sec  which are available to the public 
strategically  wesco strives to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics  with able and honest management  at sensible prices 
wesco s management prefers to invest a meaningful amount in each investee  resulting in concentration 
most equity investments are expected to be held for long periods of time  thus  wesco s management is not ordinarily troubled by short term price volatility with respect to its investments provided that the underlying business  economic and management characteristics of the investees remain favorable 
wesco strives to maintain above average levels of shareholders equity as well as much liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short term equity price volatility 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized upon the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative prices of alternative investments  or general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized upon the sale of a particular security may be adversely affected if a relatively large quantity of the security is being sold 
the following table summarizes wesco s equity price risks as of december  and it shows the effects of a hypothetical overall increase or decrease in market prices of marketable equity securities owned by the wesco group on total recorded market value and  after tax effect  on wesco s shareholders equity at each of those dates 
amounts are in thousands 
december  december  increase decrease increase decrease market value of marketable equity securities as recorded hypothetical shareholders equity as recorded hypothetical the hypothetical changes in market values assumed in preparing the tables do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  actual results could be much worse or better due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned concentration existing in wesco s equity investment portfolio 
interest rate risk wesco s consolidated balance sheet at december  contained million of securities with fixed maturities stated at fair value  down from million one year earlier 
the decrease resulted principally from maturities and redemptions of such securities during the year 
proceeds received were mainly invested in us treasury notes and investments maturing within three months cash equivalents  as a result  cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet increased from billion to billion during consequently  market value risks with respect to interest rate movements or otherwise as of december  are considered insignificant 
the fair values of wesco s fixed maturity investments fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values 
fair values of wesco s investments may also be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions
