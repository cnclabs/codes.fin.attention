item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed under forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and  to a lesser extent  other sorbent materials 
our principal products include cat litter  industrial and automotive floor absorbents  fluid purification and filtration bleaching clays  agricultural chemical carriers and sports field products 
our products are sold to two primary customer groups  including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end customer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product 
in the first quarter of fiscal we reorganized our management group in order to best support our customers needs 
as a result of this reorganization  we have two reportable segments  the retail and wholesale products group and the business to business products group 
each operating segment is discussed individually below 
additional detailed descriptions of the operating segments are included in item business 
during fiscal  we continued to experience significant price increases for packaging  transportation  fuel and energy 
the price increases were primarily driven by a global increase in demand for oil and by fuel supply interruptions as the result of damage to oil production facilities caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
these higher costs negatively impacted our margins 
our delivered cost of goods is very sensitive to increases in the costs of natural gas and fuel oil  as well as the costs of packaging materials  steel and diesel fuel 
we also continued to face an increasingly competitive environment in all of our markets 
the retail market has become particularly competitive  partially due to the continued growth of high volume retail stores 
global contracting for our fluid purification and filtration products has also increased price pressure 
in addition  new technologies are challenging the traditional application of some of our agricultural products 
during the year we implemented energy surcharges and price increases to partially address the higher costs incurred in producing our products 
competitive pricing pressure limits the capacity of this strategy  so we have also focused on internal cost reduction programs 
a company wide directive for operational excellence included initiatives to increase efficiencies at our manufacturing facilities and to implement procurement programs to reduce costs 
although our net income in fiscal has declined from fiscal  we believe the strategies we implemented prevented a substantial decline in fiscal net income 
on june   the board announced a five for four stock split  to be effected by a stock dividend of one quarter share for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock 
the stock dividend was paid on september  to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  the board also elected to maintain the per share dividend rate at per share of outstanding common stock  effectively increasing the dividend payout by approximately 
all shares outstanding  earnings per share numbers and balance sheet values have been restated to reflect the stock dividend 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal net income for the year was  a decrease of from net income of  in fiscal diluted income per share was 
in fiscal  versus 
in fiscal fiscal net income was positively impacted by a increase in sales for the business to business products group and a increase in sales for the retail and wholesale products group 
these sales improvements were driven by growth in both tons sold and price increases 
overall  we reported a total tons sold increase in fiscal compared to fiscal also  positively impacting net income for the year was a  gain on the sale of long lived assets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this gain 
negatively impacting the results for fiscal were substantial material  packaging  freight and manufacturing cost increases  as described in the overview section above 
the impact of the cost increases were experienced by both our domestic and foreign operations 
the cost increases were greater than the sales increases described above and particularly impacted the retail and wholesale products group 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  from net sales of  in fiscal strong sales growth was seen in agricultural carriers  co manufactured and fluids purification products 
agricultural carrier sales increased due to higher prices and higher volumes 
in fiscal  agricultural carrier volumes were particularly low due to customers using inventory carried over from the prior year and due to increasing acceptance of genetically modified and treated seed in the market 
in fiscal  sales volume rebounded as customer inventory levels returned to normal  however genetically modified seed continued to erode the market for agricultural carriers 
the increase in agricultural carrier production also increased the availability of the group s flo fre product line  which in turn caused a further increase in sales 
co manufactured products sales increased due to price increases 
fluids purification products reported a sales increase due to price increases and higher volumes 
bleaching earth and filtration products benefited from sales efforts to increase their presence in the marketplace by increasing sales staff 
price competition remains intense for these products due to international edible oil processors contracting globally to leverage buying power 
sports products sales were consistent with fiscal animal health and nutrition products sales were down due to lower volume 
the warm winter weather and a declining chicken market due to avian bird flu concerns resulted in lower sales of poultry guard 
conditionade sales were down as competition intensified  however  we believe our mycotoxin expertise and increased focus on mycotoxin issues worldwide will drive increased sales of conditionade in the future 
the business to business products group s operating income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increased sales in agricultural carriers  bleaching earth and filtration and co manufactured products described above contributed significantly to the increase in income 
partially offsetting the increased sales were increased manufacturing and freight costs 
material costs increased  packaging costs increased and freight costs increased 
higher selling and administrative expense increases accounted for about a reduction in income 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  reported in fiscal the growth was driven by sales of both branded and private label cat litters and industrial floor absorbent products 
sales of branded cat litter increased 
our branded scoopable litter products drove the sales growth with a increase due to price increases and higher volume 
the higher volumes were driven by increases in existing base business  new distribution and new product offerings 
private label cat litter sales were up in fiscal due to price increases and a volume increase 
our canadian operation s total sales increased in fiscal  which was driven by private label cat litter products due to expanded distribution and price increases 
net sales of floor absorbents also increased due to price increases 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal driving the segment s income decline was a increase in packaging costs  a increase in material costs and a increase in freight costs 
transportation and manufacturing fuel costs and resin prices have increased as the cost of oil has increased 
bag stock costs have increased with the price of paper 
selling price increases offset some of the increased freight  packaging and materials costs 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal freight  materials  fuel and packaging cost increases drove the decline in gross profit 
non fuel manufacturing costs rose per manufactured ton  which had a negative impact on gross profit 
also  as fuel costs increased  so did the cost of other utilities  services contract mining and hauling and repair parts used to maintain facilities 
the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing processes increased per manufactured ton on a full year basis  despite our forward purchase program 
overall volume and price increases were insufficient to compensate for the change in the key cost factors 
general price increases and volume growth in agricultural carriers  bleaching earth and filtration and co manufactured products positively impacted the results 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from the reported in fiscal operating expenses in fiscal include stock based compensation expense of  due to the implementation of fas r share based payments  as described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and a  gain on sale of long lived assets 
operating expenses in fiscal were adversely impacted by approximately  of costs associated with our sarbanes oxley section readiness effort 
excluding these items  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal would remain at and fiscal would have been 
the decrease in fiscal operating expense was driven by a reduction in bonus expense and a reduction in research and development costs 
the reduction in research and development costs was due to a department reorganization that resulted in reduced headcount and a refocus of research efforts 
interest expense for fiscal increased  from fiscal due to the new debt issuance described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income increased  from fiscal due to increased interest rates in the market and increased investment balances 
the effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal the tax expense for fiscal included a  tax impact for the repatriation of previously accumulated untaxed foreign earnings and profits as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding this additional tax expense  the effective tax rate would have been  which was consistent with the rate for fiscal total assets increased  or during fiscal current assets increased  or from the fiscal year end balances 
all categories of current assets increased  with the largest increases in investments in securities  inventories  accounts receivable  and cash and cash equivalents 
the changes in accounts receivables and cash and investments are described in liquidity and capital resources 
inventories increased due to the higher cost of materials and increased tons in ending inventory 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased  or from the year end balance in fiscal all categories of property  plant and equipment increased  with the largest increase in machinery and equipment 
total liabilities increased  or  during fiscal current liabilities increased  or during fiscal  primarily due to increases in accounts payable  other accrued expenses and current notes payable 
the increases in accounts payable and other accrued expenses are primarily related to the increase in energy and packaging costs as well as increased sales 
accrued interest also increased due to the new debt 
the increase in current notes payable is related to the scheduled payment of debt 
non current liabilities increased  or 
the primary reason for this increase was that notes payable increased due to the  new debt issuance  described in note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements  offset by payments on debt made during the year 
the accruals for pension and other post retirement benefits were also higher at the end of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales for the year ended july  were  an increase of from net sales of  in fiscal net income for the year was  an increase of compared to the net income reported in fiscal of  diluted income per share was in fiscal  versus in fiscal fiscal net income was positively impacted by sales growth in both the retail and wholesale products and business to business products groups  but negatively impacted by decreased operating income in both groups 
both the business to business products group and the retail and wholesale products group experienced declines in sales volume during fiscal overall  a decrease in total tons sold was reported in fiscal general price increases helped offset some of the overall volume decline  however  cost increases in packaging  fuel  freight and manufacturing negatively impacted fiscal s results 
these cost increases were generally driven directly or indirectly by the higher cost of energy experienced by the world economy 
both our domestic and foreign operations were impacted by the cost increases 
positively effecting fiscal net income was a reduction in total bonus expense and a reduction in advertising and marketing expenses in the retail and wholesale products group 
fiscal income was negatively impacted by a  pre tax loss on impaired assets  a  pre tax charge to settle a patent infringement lawsuit and  of pre tax defense costs associated with the company s settlement of the patent infringement litigation 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the loss on impaired long lived assets and the settlement of the patent infringement lawsuit 
business to business products group net sales of the business to business products group for fiscal were  an increase of  from net sales of  in fiscal strong sales growth was seen in co manufactured  fluids purification and animal health and nutrition products 
co manufactured product sales were up due to a new customer 
bleaching earth product sales were up approximately for the year 
the growth was experienced both domestically and in the international market place 
bleaching earth products experienced solid volume growth  but pricing was relatively flat 
price competition increased as international edible oil processors contracted globally to leverage their buying power 
animal health and nutrition product sales were up primarily from foreign sales of conditionade 
our agricultural carrier sales experienced a decline during fiscal the net sales decrease resulted from reduced orders from the three major agricultural chemical formulators  primarily those formulating chemicals to combat corn rootworm 
these formulators delayed their production start ups in the first quarter of fiscal due to inventory carryover from last season and they continued to order less product due to the increasing acceptance of genetically modified and treated seed in the market 
the significant decrease in agricultural carrier production also reduced the availability of the group s flo fre product line  which in turn caused a further reduction of sales 
flo fre product sales were down approximately compared to fiscal partially offsetting some of the sales decline was growth in the group s sports field business 
the sports field product sales were up approximately for the year 
the business to business products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decline in agricultural carrier and flo fre sales described above contributed significantly to the decrease in income 
the group also experienced increased manufacturing and freight costs  which could not be fully recovered by price increases 
freight costs increased  packaging costs increased and material costs increased 
higher selling and administrative expense increases accounted for about a reduction in income 
retail and wholesale products group net sales of the retail and wholesale products group for fiscal were  an increase of from net sales of  reported in fiscal sales growth was seen in our canadian operations and in our industrial floor absorbent products 
our core cat litter business was consistent with fiscal our canadian operation s total sales increased in fiscal  which was driven by private label cat litter products 
industrial floor absorbent sales increased for the year 
most of the sales increase was driven by improved sales of generic floor absorbent products 
branded cat litter sales were up due to the introduction of new products  but private label sales were down due to competitive market pressure 
the retail and wholesale products group s operating income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal driving the segment s income decline was a increase in packaging costs  increase in freight costs and a increase in material costs 
transportation and manufacturing fuel costs and resin prices increased as the cost of oil increased 
bag stock costs also increased as the price of paper increased 
price increases and reductions of selling and advertising expenses offset some of the increased freight  packaging and materials costs 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal freight  materials  fuel and packaging cost increases  along with the significant sales decline in agricultural carriers  drove the decline in fiscal s gross profit 
non fuel manufacturing costs rose per manufactured ton  which had a negative impact on gross profit 
part of the non fuel manufacturing cost increase was caused by decreased fixed cost coverage associated with the reduced demand for the agricultural products 
also  as fuel costs increased  so did the cost of other utilities  services contract mining and hauling and repair parts used to maintain facilities 
the cost of fuel used in the manufacturing processes increased per manufactured ton on a full year basis  despite our forward purchase program 
general price increases and volume growth in bleaching earth products positively impacted the results 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal decreased to from the reported in fiscal fiscal s operating expenses were adversely impacted by approximately  of costs associated with our sarbanes oxley section readiness effort 
fiscal s operating expenses were adversely impacted by the patent infringement litigation and a loss on impaired assets 
excluding  these items operating expenses in fiscal would have been and fiscal would have been 
the decrease in fiscal operating expense was driven by reduced selling and advertising expenses in the retail and wholesale products group  a reduction in bonus expense and a reduction in corporate telecommunications expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the reduction in outstanding debt of  interest income increased  from fiscal due to the change in our investment portfolio and increased interest rates in the market 
the effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal versus in fiscal fiscal tax expense was negatively impacted by a  tax expense recorded on certain unremitted earnings of our switzerland subsidiary 
this charge was taken to reflect the estimated potential impact of repatriating certain cash balances held by that subsidiary 
total assets decreased  or during fiscal current assets decreased  or from the fiscal year end balances  primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents  investments in securities  accounts receivable  deferred taxes and prepaid overburden removal expense 
offsetting part of this decrease was an increase in other prepaid expenses and a small increase in inventory 
the decrease in cash and investments was due to the substantial increase in purchases of treasury stock 
property  plant and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation increased  or  from the year end balance in fiscal capital expenditures were mostly offset by normal depreciation expense 
total liabilities decreased  or  during fiscal current liabilities decreased  or during fiscal  primarily due to decreases in current notes payable  salaries  wages and commissions payable  accrued trade promotions  and other accrued expenses 
the drop in long term notes payable and current notes payable related to the overall payment of  of debt 
the reduction in accrued salaries was related to the reduced discretionary bonus payments in fiscal in fiscal  other accrued expenses were increased by the settlement of the patent infringement litigation  described in note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements 
foreign operations net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company sales 
this represents an increase of from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary sales were  or of total company sales 
this increase in sales was seen in both the canadian and united kingdom entities 
the canadian entity s sales increase was driven by private label cat litter products 
expanded distribution and price increases contributed to part of this increase 
offsetting some of this increase in canada was a decline in industrial products sales due to weaker industrial economic conditions in the market 
the increase in the united kingdom subsidiary s sales was partially driven by new customers for that location 
for fiscal  the foreign subsidiaries reported income of  a reduction of  from the  income reported in fiscal the reduction to income for the year was driven by increased material  freight and packaging costs in the canadian operation 
both the canadian and united kingdom operations faced material sourcing issues which contributed to part of the material cost increases 
escalating energy costs accounted for much of the rest of the increase 
identifiable assets of the foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  most of the decrease in identifiable assets was in cash and cash equivalents 
certain investments were liquidated to facilitate the repatriation of previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during fiscal were  or of total company sales 
this represents an increase of from fiscal  in which foreign subsidiary sales were  or of total company sales 
this increase in sales was seen largely in our canadian operation with private label cat litter sales improving from fiscal for fiscal  the foreign subsidiaries reported income of  a reduction of  from the  income reported in fiscal the reduction to income for the year was driven by increased material  freight and packaging costs in the canadian operation 
identifiable assets of the foreign subsidiaries as of july  were  compared to  as of july  most of the increase in identifiable assets was in accounts receivable and property  plant and equipment 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs  the purchasing and upgrading of real estate  equipment and facilities  and investing in infrastructure and potential acquisitions 
we principally have used cash generated from operations and  to the extent needed  issuance of debt securities and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund these requirements 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled   and  at july   and  respectively 
as of july   we had  available under our revolving credit facility with harris na the following table sets forth certain elements of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands fiscal year ended july  july  july  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations decreased by  to  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in net income during fiscal  a decrease in depreciation and amortization and other non cash charges  and an increase in working capital 
net cash provided by operations decreased by  to  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in depreciation and other non cash charges and a decrease in current liabilities 
for fiscal years and  the primary components of working capital that impacted operating cash flows were as follows accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  increased by  compared to fiscal year end the increase was due to sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal of  versus sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal of  accounts receivable in decreased  as compared to due to bad debt recovery and a focused effort to improve accounts receivable processes 
inventories increased in compared to fiscal by  due to higher cost of materials and increased tons in ending inventory 
inventories in increased only  as compared to fiscal prepaid overburden removal expense in fiscal increased  compared to fiscal during fiscal  prepaid overburden removal expense decreased  year to year fluctuations are the result of different amounts of non usable material that need to be removed from the various sites 
accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased energy and packaging costs 
during fiscal  accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased  due to a  accrual for a patent infringement lawsuit settlement at july  and lower accruals for trade promotions  advertising and bonus at july  net cash used in investing activities cash used in investing activities increased  compared to fiscal to  during fiscal in fiscal  cash used for capital expenditures was  a  increase compared to fiscal during fiscal cash available from new long term debt financing was used to purchase debt and investment securities of  net of dispositions  compared to net dispositions of debt and investment securities of  in fiscal cash proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment were  in fiscal versus  in fiscal cash used in investing activities decreased  compared to fiscal to  during fiscal in fiscal  more cash was available for investing due to  received from the termination of two split dollar life insurance plans and reduced capital spending as compared to fiscal in fiscal   cash was spent to purchase assets related to the jonny cat brand of cat litter 
during fiscal cash was used to purchase debt and investment securities of  net of dispositions 
in fiscal  many of these investments matured and the cash was used for the purchase of treasury stock 
during fiscal  cash was provided by dispositions of debt and investment securities of  net of purchases 
conversely  cash used for capital expenditures in fiscal increased  compared to fiscal net cash provided by used in financing activities cash was provided by financing activities during fiscal of  compared to cash used by financing activities during fiscal of  during fiscal cash was provided primarily from proceeds from issuance of long term debt of  principal payments on long term debt were also  less in fiscal versus and net purchases of treasury stock were  lower in fiscal versus in contrast  proceeds from issuance of common stock  primarily related to stock option exercises  were  lower in fiscal versus cash used by financing activities increased  compared to fiscal to  during fiscal during fiscal net purchases of treasury stock were  higher compared to fiscal in contrast  proceeds from issuance of common stock  primarily related to stock option exercises  were  higher in fiscal versus other total cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries at july   and were   and  respectively 
certain investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were liquidated in fiscal to facilitate the repatriation of previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we received cash grants of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal from the state of illinois 
the money from these grants was used to enhance processing capabilities at our mounds  illinois production facility 
these funds were accounted for on a net grant accounting basis  therefore they were not shown as a cash in flow or a capital expenditure outflow 
as of july  and  the grant funds received in the respective fiscal years were completely utilized 
as part of the normal course of business  we guarantee certain debts and trade payables of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
these arrangements are made at the request of the subsidiaries creditors  as separate financial statements are not distributed for the wholly owned subsidiaries 
as of july   the value of these guarantees was  of short term liabilities   of lease liabilities and  of long term debt 
our capital requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise 
the tables in the following subsection summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  for the timeframes indicated 
we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement with harris n 
a on january   pursuant to which we may borrow up to  from time to time 
our payment obligations under this credit agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that  among other things and under various conditions including a limitation on capital expenditures  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to acquire or dispose of assets 
the agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth 
as of july   we had  available under this credit facility and were in compliance with our covenants 
we believe that cash flow from operations  availability under our revolving credit facility and current cash and investment balances will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities and debt service obligations for at least the next months 
our ability to fund operations  to make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all of the financial covenants under debt agreements  including  but not limited to  the credit agreement  depends on our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt     interest on long term debt     operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations   we are not required to make a contribution to our defined benefit pension plan in fiscal we have not presented this obligation for future years in the table above because the funding requirement can vary from year to year based on changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions 
amount of commitment expiration per period total other commercial amounts less than commitments committed year years years after years standby letters of credit   other commercial commitments   total commercial commitments   the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
as of july   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
annually we review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies stated in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the policies listed below involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include promotional programs  allowance for doubtful accounts  prepaid overburden  pension accounting and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
stock split effected by a stock dividend 
if a stock split is effected after the close of the fiscal year  but before the release of the financial statements  generally accepted accounting principles require per share data to be based on the new shares outstanding including the effect of the stock split transaction 
in addition  if the par value of the underlying stock is not reduced for a stock dividend  a credit to the common stock account and a charge to paid in capital are necessary to adjust the aggregate par value 
our board announced the stock dividend on june  the stock dividend was paid on september  to shareholders of record at the close of business on august  accordingly  shares outstanding  income loss per share and balance sheet values for all years presented have been restated to reflect the five for four stock split effected by a stock dividend of one quarter share for each outstanding share of common stock and class b stock and the adjustment to aggregate par value has been made 
revenue recognition 
under the terms of our sales agreements with customers  we recognize revenue when title is transferred 
upon shipment an invoice is generated that sets the fixed and determinable price 
sales returns and allowances have historically not been material 
trade promotions and advertising 
we routinely commit to one time or on going trade promotion programs in our retail and wholesale products group 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers  such as coupons  and sales incentives made to customers  such as slotting  discounts based on sales volume  cooperative marketing programs and other arrangements 
all such trade promotion costs are netted against sales 
advertising costs are part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have accrued liabilities at the end of each period for the estimated expenses incurred  but unpaid for trade spending and advertising programs 
the determination of the trade spending liabilities requires us to use judgment for estimates which include our historical experience with trade spending patterns and that of the industry  current trends and forecasted data 
while management believes our promotional reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made  estimated amounts could differ from future obligations 
we recorded reserves of  and  for these trade promotions and advertising liabilities at july  and  respectively 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes all manufacturing costs  inbound and outbound freight  inspection costs  purchasing costs associated with materials and packaging used in the production processes and warehouse and distribution costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  wages and benefits associated with the staff outside the manufacturing and distribution functions  all marketing related costs  any miscellaneous trade spending expenses not required to be included in net sales  research and development costs and all other non manufacturing and non distribution expenses 
cash equivalents and investments in securities 
cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
investments in treasury securities are carried at cost  plus accrued interest  which approximates market 
we occasionally purchase as investments certain debt securities of highly rated united states corporations 
these securities are reported as current or long term depending on the maturity of the instrument 
we classify these investments as held to maturity and measure them on an amortized cost basis because we have both the intention and the ability to hold these investments to maturity 
trade receivables 
trade receivables are recognized when the risk of loss and title pass to the customer consistent with the revenue recognition policy 
we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable  including a review of the overall aging of accounts and analysis of specific accounts 
while management believes our allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  the unanticipated default by a customer with material trade receivable could occur 
we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  at july  and  respectively 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory costs include the cost of raw materials  packaging supplies  labor and other overhead costs 
we perform a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment is necessary 
the review surveys all of our operating facilities and sales divisions to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends are considered 
the allowance not only considers specific items  but also takes into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
the inventory obsolescence reserve values at july  and were  and  respectively 
prepaid overburden removal and mining costs 
we mine sorbent materials on property that we either own or lease as part of our overall operations 
a significant part of our mining cost is incurred during the process of removing the overburden non usable material from the mine site  thus exposing the sorbent material that is then used in a majority of our production processes 
the cost of the overburden removal is recorded in a prepaid expense account and  as the usable sorbent material is mined  the prepaid overburden removal expense is amortized over the estimated available material 
we had  and  of prepaid expense recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  as of july  and  respectively 
we amortized to current expense approximately  of previously recorded prepaid expense in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal see the discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding eitf issue no 
 accounting for stripping costs in the mining industry  which will change our reporting of post production stripping costs beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year to determine the value of prepaid overburden  our mining personnel survey the individual mining areas 
the estimation work is conducted utilizing a combination of manual and computerized survey tools 
once the survey data is recorded it is charted on numerous topographical maps of the mining areas 
finally  based on the survey data  maps and professional judgment of the mining engineers estimates are developed 
during the normal course of our overburden removal activities we perform on going reclamation activities 
as overburden is removed from a pit  it is hauled to a previously mined pit and used to refill the older site 
this process allows us to continuously reclaim older pits and dispose of overburden simultaneously  therefore minimizing the liability for the reclamation function 
additionally  it is our policy to capitalize the purchase cost of land and mineral rights  including associated legal fees  survey fees and real estate fees 
the costs of obtaining mineral patents  including legal fees and drilling expenses  are also capitalized 
pre production development costs on new mines and any prepaid royalties that are offset against future royalties due upon extraction of the mineral are also capitalized 
all exploration related costs are expensed as incurred 
impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue  expense growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
our impairment analysis is performed in the first quarter of the fiscal year and we use judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological changes  competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
our analysis in the first quarter of fiscal did not indicate any impairment 
we continue to monitor events  circumstances or changes in the business that might imply a reduction in value and might lead to impairment 
stock based compensation 
on august  we adopted financial accounting standards fas no 
r share based payments fas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees 
the fair value is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing method 
fas r requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in fiscal was  net of related tax effect 
this includes expense related to stock option grants and amortization of restricted stock 
we adopted the pronouncement using a modified prospective application 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we had applied accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related other interpretations to account for our stock option plans 
under apb  we applied the intrinsic value method 
all of the outstanding options issued under the plans had exercise prices equal to the market value on the day of issue 
accordingly  we did not record any compensation expense associated with our issuance of stock options 
had we accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  we would have reported in fiscal years and additional employee compensation expense net of related tax effect of approximately  and  respectively 
see note to the notes of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension accounting 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect actual experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations and historical experience 
the expected long term rate of inflation and risk premiums for the various asset categories are based on general historical returns and inflation rates 
the target allocation of assets is used to develop a composite rate of return assumption 
the discount rate is based on a market benchmark rate that is of comparable duration to the plan s liabilities 
specifically  at july   the discount rate was based on the citigroup pension liability index and at july  the discount rate was based on moody s aa corporate bond yield adjusted to be based on annual compounding 
the rate was rounded to the nearest basis points 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we determine our current and deferred taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the tax effect of the reversal of tax differences is recorded at rates currently enacted for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
to the extent that temporary differences will result in future tax benefit  we must estimate the timing of their reversal and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any deferred tax assets 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings and other factors that could effect the realization of deferred tax assets 
we recorded valuation allowances for income taxes of  and  at july  and  respectively 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement requires recognition of the funded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position 
funded status is determined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
changes in that funded status should be recognized in other comprehensive income 
this recognition provision and the related disclosures are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the statement also requires the measurement of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position 
this measurement provision is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently reviewing this pronouncement  but we believe it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurement  effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but simplifies and codifies related guidance within generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
we are currently reviewing this pronouncement  but we believe it will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the pronouncement provides a recognition threshold and measurement guidance for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we are currently reviewing this pronouncement  but we believe it will not have a material impact on our financial statements

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable 
we would only be impacted by this statement if it made a voluntary change in accounting principle after the effective date 
in march  the financial accounting standards board ratified the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
eitf issue  accounting for stripping costs in the mining industry 
the consensus will be effective for the first fiscal period in the fiscal year beginning after december  the consensus on eitf issue calls for post production stripping costs to be treated as a variable inventory production cost 
as a result  such costs are subject to inventory costing procedures in the period they are incurred 
once eitf issue becomes effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we will be required to write off the amount of our prepaid overburden removal expense account at august  as a cumulative effect adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings 
although the write off adjusts the opening balance of retained earnings  it will also reduce our earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal the value of the prepaid overburden removal expense account at july  was  also  on an ongoing basis we expect not to defer and amortize the vast majority of our overburden removal expenses 
post production overburden removal costs will be considered variable production expenses and will be included in cost of sales in the period they are incurred  however  in accordance with eitf issue  we will continue to defer and amortize the pre production overburden removal costs associated with opening a new mine 
we expect these changes to result in increased earnings volatility on a quarterly  but not an annual  basis 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk and employ policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the market risk of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of july  we believe that the market risk arising from holdings of our financial instruments is not material 
we are exposed to currency risk as it relates to certain accounts receivables and our foreign operations 
we believe that the currency risk is immaterial to the overall presentation of the financial statements 
we are exposed to regulatory risk in the fluid purification and agricultural markets  principally as a result of the risk of increasing regulation of the food chain in the united states and europe 
we actively monitor developments in this area  both directly and through trade organizations of which we are a member 
we are exposed to commodity price risk with respect to fuel 
we plan to contract for of our fuel needs for fiscal using forward purchase contracts to manage the volatility in fuel prices related to this exposure 
all contracts are related to the normal course of business and no contracts are entered into for speculative purposes 
the weighted average cost of our natural gas contracts has been estimated to be approximately higher than the contracts for fiscal the following table provides information about our natural gas future contracts  which are sensitive to changes in commodity prices  specifically natural gas prices 
for the future contracts the table presents the notional amounts in mmbtu s  the weighted average contract prices  and the total dollar contract amount  which will mature by july  the fair value was determined using the most recent settle price for the henry hub natural gas option contract prices as listed by the new york mercantile exchange on october  commodity price sensitivity natural gas future contracts for the year ending july  expected maturity fair value natural gas future volumes mmbtu  weighted average price per mmbtu contract amount us  in thousands   factors that could influence the fair value of the natural gas contracts  include  but are not limited to  the creditworthiness of our natural gas suppliers  the overall general economy  developments in world events  and the general demand for natural gas by the manufacturing sector  seasonality and the weather patterns throughout the united states and the world 
some of these same events have allowed us to mitigate the impact of the natural gas contracts by the continued  and in some cases expanded  use of recycled oil in our manufacturing processes 
accurate estimates of the impact that these contracts may have on our fiscal financial results are difficult to make due to the inherent uncertainty of future fluctuations in option contract prices in the natural gas options market 
please also see item a above  risk factors  for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face in our business
