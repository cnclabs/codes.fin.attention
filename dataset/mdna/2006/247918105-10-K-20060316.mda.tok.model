item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements set forth therein 
please also see part i item forward looking statements and risk factors and part i item a 
risk factors 
general we are a national specialty consumer finance company that originates  securitizes and sells and  prior to may  serviced non conforming mortgage loans 
our loans are primarily secured by first mortgages on one to four family residential properties 
throughout our year operating history  we have focused on lending to individuals who generally do not satisfy the credit  documentation or other underwriting standards set by more traditional sources of mortgage credit  including those entities that make loans in compliance with conventional mortgage lending guidelines established by fannie mae and freddie mac 
we make loans to these borrowers for purposes such as debt consolidation  refinancing  education and home improvements 
we have historically financed or sold our loans through securitizations and sold whole loans 
prior to  those securitizations were typically structured and accounted for as sales  which required us to record revenues as gain on sale at the time the securitizations were completed 
in  we began structuring our securitizations to be accounted for as secured financings  which requires us to record revenues and expenses from these transactions over time 
we record interest income from the securitized loans and interest expense from the asset backed securities issued in connection with each securitization over the life of the loans or securities issued in the securitization 
when we sell loans on a whole loan basis  we record the premiums received upon sale as revenue 
we intend to continue to structure our securitizations to be accounted for as secured financings and to securitize the majority of the mortgage loans we originate so as to increase the size of our on balance sheet loan portfolio that generates interest income 
as the size of our loan portfolio continues to increase in  as compared to  we anticipate recording increased net interest income generated from the loan portfolio 
summary of critical accounting policies an appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results 
these policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties  and as a result  these estimates may significantly impact our financial results 
the precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a range of possible outcomes and a number of underlying variables and there can be no assurance that our estimates are accurate 
excess cashflow certificates 
in securitization transactions structured to be accounted for as a gain on sale prior to  the excess cash flow certificates represent one or all of the following assets bio certificate  which represents a subordinate right to receive excess cash flows  if any  generated by the related securitization pool 
as a holder of the bio certificate  we have the right to receive the difference  if any  between the interest payments due on the mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust and the interest payments due  at the pass through rates  to the holders of the asset backed securities of the same series  net of contractual servicing fees  trustee fees  insurer premiums  reimbursements and other costs and expenses of administering the securitization trust 
as a holder of the bio certificate  we will receive cash payments which  when we sell nim notes  is only received after the nim notes are paid in full only to the extent that the cash received by the securitization trust exceeds the amounts owed on all of the securities issued by that securitization trust  including amounts needed for the payment of any trust related expenses 
p certificate  which represents a right to receive prepayment penalties on the mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust 
generally  prepayment penalties are received from borrowers who pay off their loans within the first few years after obtaining their loans which  when we sell nim notes  is only received after the nim notes are paid in full 
cash flows from interest rate caps we receive payments on corridors corresponding purchase and sale of interest rate caps with similar notional balances at different strike prices from third party cap providers through the securitization trusts which  when we sell nim notes  are only received after the nim notes are paid in full 
the excess cash flows we receive are highly dependent upon the interest rate environment  because basis risk exists between the securitization trust s assets and liabilities 
for example  in each of the securitizations that we issued in and  the excess cashflow certificates are impacted by the securitization pass through rate sold to investors  which is indexed against the one month libor 
as a result  the interest rate received by the pass through certificate holders from the securitization trust each month may adjust upwards or downwards as the one month libor changes liability while the majority of the underlying mortgage loans assets in the securitization trust are fixed rate loans  or are at a fixed rate for at least two to three years before becoming adjustable rate loans 
as a result  as rates rise and fall  the amount of our excess cash flows will fall and rise  respectively 
this in turn will increase or decrease the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
the excess cashflow certificates held at december  are those we acquired before we began to structure our securitizations to be accounted for as secured financings in in each of our securitizations in which we sold nim note s  we purchased an interest rate cap  which helps mitigate the basis risk for the approximate time that the nim notes are anticipated to be outstanding 
the accounting estimates we use to value excess cashflow certificates are deemed to be critical accounting estimates because they can materially affect our income 
the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates requires us to forecast interest rates  mortgage principal payments  prepayments  index rates and loan loss assumptions  each of which is highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
the rate used to discount the projected cash flows is also critical in the valuation of our excess cashflow certificates 
management uses internal  historical mortgage loan performance data and forward libor interest rate curves to value future expected excess cash flows 
we believe that the value of our excess cashflow certificates at the date of a securitization reflected their fair value 
the amount recorded for the excess cashflow certificates is subsequently reduced for cash distributions we receive  increased for the expected return and adjusted for changes in fair value of these excess cashflow certificates 
at the closing date of each securitization transaction structured to be accounted for as a sale  we determined the present value of the excess cashflow certificates using the same assumptions we made regarding the underlying mortgage loans 
the excess cashflow certificate was then recorded on our consolidated financial statements at its estimated fair value 
the value of each excess cashflow certificate represents the present value of the future cash flows we expect to receive in the future based upon our best estimates 
although we believe that the assumptions we use are reasonable  there can be no assurance as to the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates 
our estimates primarily include the following future rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans the expected amount of prepayments if the underlying borrowers pay off their mortgage loans prior to the expected maturity  credit losses default rates on the mortgage loans including when the losses are expected to occur our estimated amount of losses or defaults that will take place on the underlying mortgage loans over their life because the excess cashflow certificates are subordinated to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
consequently  any losses sustained on mortgage loans comprising a particular securitization trust are first absorbed by the excess cashflow certificates  the libor forward curve using current libor as the floor rate our estimate of future interest rates  which affects both the rate paid to the floating rate asset backed security investors primarily the one month libor index and the rates earned from the adjustable rate mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust which typically provide for a fixed rate of interest for the first or months and a six month variable rate of interest thereafter using the six month libor index  and a discount rate used to calculate present value 
we monitor the performance of the mortgage loans underlying each excess cashflow certificate  and any changes in our estimates resulting in a change in fair value of the excess cashflow certificates is reflected as a change in fair value of excess cashflow certificates recorded in the statement of operations as a component of other income or other expense in the period in which we make the change in our estimate 
we revised our assumptions used to value our excess cashflow certificates during the third quarter of the impact of these changed assumptions resulted in an increase in the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
in determining the fair value of each of the excess cashflow certificates  we make the following underlying assumptions regarding mortgage loan prepayments  mortgage loan default rates  the libor forward curve and discount rates a 
prepayments 
we base our prepayment rate assumptions on our ongoing analysis of the performance of the mortgage loan pools we previously securitized  and the performance of similar pools of mortgage loans securitized by others in the industry 
we apply different prepayment speed assumptions to different loan product types based on our experience with different loan product types exhibiting different prepayment patterns 
generally  our mortgage loans can be grouped into two loan products fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans 
with fixed rate loans  an underlying borrower s interest rate remains fixed throughout the life of the loan 
our adjustable rate loans are a hybrid between fixed and adjustable rate loans  in that the interest rate generally remains fixed  typically for the first two or three years of the loan  and then adjusts  typically every six months thereafter 
within each product type  factors other than interest rates can affect our prepayment rate assumptions 
these factors include whether or not a loan contains a prepayment penalty  which is the amount a borrower must pay to a lender if the borrower prepays the loan within a certain time period after the loan was originated 
historically  loans containing a prepayment penalty typically are not repaid as quickly as those without a penalty  and as is customary in our industry with adjustable rate mortgage loans  the introductory interest rate we charge to the borrower is lower  between one and two full percentage points  than the rate for which the borrower would have otherwise qualified 
generally  once the interest rate begins to adjust  the interest rate payable on that mortgage loan generally increases  at times at a fairly substantial rate 
this interest rate increase can be exacerbated if there is an absolute increase in interest rates 
as a result of these increases  and the potential for future increases  adjustable rate mortgage loans typically are more susceptible to early prepayments 
there are several reasons why a loan may prepay prior to its maturity  including but not limited to a decrease in interest rates  improvement in the borrower s credit profile  which may allow the borrower to qualify for a mortgage loan with a lower interest rate  competition in the mortgage market  which may result in lower interest rates being offered to the borrower  the borrower s sale of the home securing the mortgage  the borrower s need for additional funds  and a default by the borrower  resulting in foreclosure by the lender 
it is unusual for a borrower to prepay a mortgage loan during the first few months because it typically takes at least several months after the mortgage loans are originated for any of the above events to occur  there are costs involved with refinancing a loan  and the borrower does not want to incur prepayment penalties 
we have found that the rate at which borrowers prepay their loans tends to fluctuate 
in general  prepayment speeds are lowest in the first month after origination  as described above 
thereafter  prepayment speeds generally increase until a peak speed is reached 
generally  loans will continue to prepay at the peak speed for some period of time  and then prepayment speeds typically begin to decline 
we use prepayment assumptions that reflect these tendencies 
the following table shows our assumptions regarding the percentage of mortgage loans that will be prepaid during the first month following the closing of a mortgage loan  peak speed over the life and the peak speed at december  forward loan type month one peak speed over the life peak speed at december  forward fixed rate to to adjustable rate to our assumption regarding the peak speed over the life for fixed rate mortgage loans ranged from to prior to september   when we revised them to the speeds noted at december  we revised our peak speed over the life assumption to reflect the prepayment trend experienced within the mortgage loan pools 
if mortgage loans prepay faster than anticipated  we generally will earn less income in connection with the mortgage loans and receive less excess cash flow in the future because the mortgage loans have paid off 
conversely  if mortgage loans prepay at a slower rate than anticipated  we generally earn more income and more excess cash flow in the future  subject to other factors that can affect the cash flow from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
b 
default rate 
the default rate is the percentage of estimated total loss of principal  interest and related advances that will take place over the life of the mortgage loans within a loan pool to the total original principal balance of the mortgage loans in the pool 
a default rate is determined for each securitization reflecting the overall credit scores  average loan sizes and layered risks on the fixed and adjustable rate loans comprising each securitization trust 
we apply a default or loss rate to the excess cashflow certificate because it is the first loss piece and is subordinated in right of payment to all other securities issued by the securitization trust 
if defaults are higher than we anticipate  we will receive less income and less excess cash flow than expected in the future 
conversely  if defaults are lower than we expected  we will receive more income and more excess cash flow than expected in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flow from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
we revised our estimated default rates at september  to reflect the better than expected pool performance on most of our underlying securitizations 
the current default rates applied on the excess cashflow certificates range from to  with the majority ranging from to 
prior to september   our default rate assumptions ranged from to  with the majority ranging from to c 
libor forward curve 
the libor forward curve is used to project future interest rates  which affects both the rate to the floating rate asset backed security investors primarily one month libor and the adjustable rate mortgage loans sold to the securitization trust a fixed rate of interest for either the first or months and a variable rate of interest thereafter using six month libor 
most of our loans are fixed rate mortgages  and a significant amount of the securities sold by the securitization trust are floating rate securities the interest rate adjusts based upon an index  such as one month libor 
as such  our excess cashflow certificates are subject to significant basis risk and a change in libor will impact our excess spread 
if libor is lower than anticipated  we will receive more income and more excess cash flow than expected in the future  subject to the other factors that can affect the cash flow from  and our valuation of  the excess cashflow certificates 
conversely  if libor is higher than expected  we will receive less income and less excess cash flow than expected in the future 
in each of our securitizations in which we sold nim note s  we purchased an interest rate cap  which helps mitigate the basis risk for the approximate time that the nim notes are outstanding 
we have adjusted the valuation of each excess cashflow certificate to use a forward interest rate curve that represents both today s rates and the expectation for rates in the future 
we use a forward libor curve that we believe reflects the estimate of future libor rates 
d 
discount rate 
we use a discount rate that we believe reflects the risks associated with our excess cashflow certificates 
due to the unavailability of quoted market prices on comparable excess cashflow certificates  we compare our valuation assumptions and performance experience to our competitors in the non conforming mortgage industry 
our discount rate takes into account the asset quality and the performance of our securitized mortgage loans compared to that of the industry and other characteristics of our securitized loans 
we quantify the risks associated with our excess cashflow certificates by comparing the asset quality and payment and loss performance experience of the underlying securitized mortgage loan pools to comparable industry performance 
the discount rate we use to determine the present value of the cash flow from excess cashflow certificates reflects increased uncertainty surrounding current and future market conditions  including  without limitation  uncertainty concerning inflation  recession  home prices  interest rates and conditions in the equity markets 
we utilized a discount rate of and at december  and  respectively  on all excess cashflow certificates 
our valuation of retained excess cashflow certificates is highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictiveness of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation model 
the assumptions we utilize  described above  are complex  as we must make judgment calls about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more complex 
in volatile markets  like those we have experienced over the past several years  there is increased risk that our actual results may vary significantly from our assumed results 
the longer the time period over which the uncertainties exist  the greater the potential for volatility in our valuation assumptions and thus impacting the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
for example  assumptions regarding prepayment speeds  defaults and libor rates are used in estimating the fair value of our excess cashflow certificates 
if loans prepay slower than estimated  or loan loss levels are higher than anticipated  or libor is higher than anticipated  a reduction in the fair value of these certificates will be recorded in earnings 
we believe that our assumptions are reasonable based upon the estimates using our historical loan performance and the performance of similar mortgage loan pools from other lenders in addition to accessing other public information about market factors such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and real estate market values  among other things 
however  these are just estimates and it is virtually impossible to predict the actual level of prepayments and losses  which are also driven by consumer behavior 
accounting for hedging activities 
we regularly issue securitization asset backed securities  backed by fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans 
as a result of this activity  we are exposed to interest rate risk beginning when our mortgage loans close and are recorded as assets  until permanent financing is arranged  such as when the asset backed securities are issued 
our strategy is to use interest rate swap contracts in an effort to lock in a pre determined base interest rate on designated portions of our prospective future securitization financing 
at times  we also use corridors corresponding purchase and sale of interest rate caps with similar notional balances at different strike prices that are designed to limit our financing costs within the securitization to maintain minimum margins  with the possibility of allowing us to increase margins in lower than anticipated interest rate environments 
both the interest rate swaps and corridors are derivative instruments that trade in liquid markets  and we do not use either of them for speculative purposes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we record all of our derivatives on our balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments  gains or losses resulting from a change in fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
when derivatives are used as hedges  however  hedge accounting is permitted only if we document the hedging relationship and its effectiveness at the time we designate the derivative as a hedge instrument 
if we meet certain requirements under sfas no 
 we may account for the hedge instrument as a cash flow hedge 
cash flow hedge accounting is appropriate for hedges of forecasted interest payments associated with future periods whether as a consequence of interest to be received or paid on existing adjustable rate assets or liabilities or in connection with intended purchases or sales 
under cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are divided into two portions  effective and ineffective 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of oci and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment hedges must be documented  with the objective and strategy stated  along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess and measure hedge effectiveness  dates or periods for the expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure must be explicitly documented  hedges must be expected to be highly effective  both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
effectiveness measures must relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flow associated with the hedged item  forecasted transactions must be probable  and forecasted transactions must be made with different counterparties other than the reporting entity 
if and when hedge accounting is discontinued  typically when it is determined that the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting  the derivative will continue to be recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value  with gains or losses being recorded in earnings 
any amounts previously recorded in oci related to the discontinued hedge are classified to earnings over the remaining duration of the debt as interest payments affect earnings 
if a hedge fails the assessment of hedge effectiveness test the ratio of the outstanding balance of the hedged item debt to the notional amount of the corridors goes above or falls below at any time  and therefore is not expected to be highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows  the hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting 
an assessment analysis is then prepared by management to determine the go forward treatment of the hedges that failed the retrospective test to determine if any portion of the hedge may still qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
if the analysis indicates future effectiveness for a portion of the hedge  the original hedge will effectively be allocated into two pieces  a trading security ineffective portion and new hedge relationship effective portion 
the new hedge relationship is determined by re aligning the hedge with the projected remaining bond balances debt as of the date the original hedge became retrospectively ineffective 
the ratio of the outstanding balance of the debt to notional size of the revised hedge will then be as of the re alignment date 
the expected repayment pattern of the debt associated to the original hedge is used as the basis to establish the new hedge relationship future repayment pattern 
the difference between the fair value of the original hedge and the new hedge relationship hedge on the re alignment date is classified as a trading security 
once classified as a trading security  any changes in the fair value are recorded directly to the income statement as a component of gain or loss on derivative instruments 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax asset 
management needs to consider the relative impact of negative and positive evidence related to the ability to recognize a deferred tax asset 
this evaluation takes into consideration our recent earnings history  current tax position and estimates of taxable income in the near term 
if actual results differ from these estimates  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which could negatively impact our consolidated financial position and results from operations 
we recognize all of our deferred tax assets if we believe  on a more likely than not basis  that all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
management believes that  based upon the currently available evidence  it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
therefore  at december  we did not maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses on mortgage loans held for investment 
in connection with our change to portfolio accounting in  we established an allowance for loan losses based on an estimate of losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future on our mortgage loans held for investment portfolio 
additionally  we charge off uncollectible loans at the time they are deemed not probable of collection 
in order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses on mortgage loans held for investment  we estimate losses using a detailed analysis of historical mortgage loan performance data 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  origination year and securitization issuance 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current long term mortgage portfolio held for investment  excluding those loans which meet the criteria for specific review under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statement no 
and  and an estimate is created 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
a provision for loan losses is charged to our consolidated statement of operations 
losses incurred  if any  will be written off against the allowance for loan losses 
while we will continually evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we recognize that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring potential expected losses on mortgage loans 
these items include  but are not limited to  current performance of the loans  economic indicators that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  changes in the market value of the collateral  political factors and the general economic environment 
as these estimates are influenced by factors outside of our control and as uncertainty is inherent in these estimates  it is reasonably possible that they could change 
in particular  if conditions were such that we were required to increase the provision for loan losses  any increase in the provision for loan losses would negatively impact our results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage loan agreement 
due to the significant effects of hurricanes katrina and rita on a portion of our mortgage loans held for investment portfolio  management identified certain loans located in federal emergency management agency fema declared disaster areas as meeting the criteria under sfas no 
requiring a separate loan impairment review 
based upon the analysis performed  we identified certain mortgage loans in which the borrowers abilities to repay the loan in accordance with their contractual terms was impaired 
we assessed the extent of damage to the underlying collateral and the extent to which damaged collateral is not covered by insurance in determining the amount of specific reserves needed 
we established specific reserves for these affected mortgage loans based upon estimates of loss exposure 
as additional information is obtained and processed over the coming months and quarters  we will continue to assess the need for any adjustments to our estimates and the specific reserves related to the mortgage loans in the affected areas 
amortization of deferred loan origination fees and costs 
interest income is recorded on our mortgage loans held for investment portfolio based upon a combination of interest accruals based on the outstanding balance and contractual terms of the mortgage loans  adjusted by the amortization of net deferred origination fees or costs accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
our net deferred origination fees consist principally of origination fees  discount points  and payroll and commissions associated with originating our mortgage loans 
for our loans held for investment  these net deferred fees or costs are accreted or amortized as adjustments to interest income over the estimated lives of the mortgage loans using the interest method 
our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment is comprised of a large number of homogeneous loans for which we believe prepayments are probable 
the periodic amortization of our deferred origination fees is based on a model that considers actual prepayment experience to date as well as forecasted prepayments based on the contractual interest rate on the mortgage loans  loan age  loan type and prepayment fee coverage  among other factors 
mortgage prepayments are affected by the terms and credit grades of the loans  conditions in the housing and financial markets and general economic conditions 
prepayment assumptions are reviewed regularly to ensure that our actual experiences  as well as industry data  are supportive of the prepayment assumptions used in our model 
any changes to these estimates are applied as if the revised estimates had been in place since the origination of the mortgage loans  and current period amortization is adjusted to reflect the effect of the changes 
during the year ended december   we recorded in interest income  of income related to a cumulative adjustment for the effects of an immaterial correction in recognition of net deferred fees in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans that related to the year ended december  this was the result of a revision in to our methodology to separate respective securitization loan pools into homogeneous pools based upon product type each of which contains a large number of similar loans for which prepayments are probable and the timing and amount of prepayments are reasonably predictable 
amortization of deferred debt issue discounts and transaction costs 
interest expense on our securitization financing is comprised of the accrual of interest based on the contractual terms  cash receipts and amortization related to our cash flow hedges swaps and corridors  the amortization of deferred issue discounts including msr related discounts and transaction costs 
the deferred issue discounts and transaction costs are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the estimated lives of the related debt using the interest method and take into account the effect of estimated prepayments 
any changes made to these estimates are applied as if the revised estimates had been in place since the issuance of the related debt  and result in adjustments to the period amortization recorded to interest expense 
federal  state and local taxation we report our income on a consolidated basis excluding renaissance reit investment corp 
and its subsidiary using the calendar year and the accrual method of accounting 
the following discussion of federal  state and local tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us 
we face audits from various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
our united states federal income tax filings have been examined by the internal revenue service irs for calendar years ending prior to all differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled 
we are currently under examination by new york state for the through calendar years 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
federal taxation corporate alternative minimum tax 
in addition to the regular income tax  the code imposes an alternative minimum tax amt in an amount equal to of alternative minimum taxable income amti to the extent the amt exceeds the taxpayers regular income tax 
amti is regular taxable income as modified by certain adjustments and tax preference items 
amti includes an amount equal to of the excess of adjusted current earnings over amti determined without regard to this adjustment and prior to reduction for net operating losses 
only of amti can be offset by net operating loss carry forwards 
the amt is available as a credit against future regular income tax 
the amt credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
for  we do not expect to be subject to the amt 
excess inclusion 
all or a portion of the income we receive from the residual interest certificates excess cashflow certificates  which are created in a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic securitization  is referred to as excess inclusion 
in addition  all or a portion of the dividend delta funding corporation receives from renaissance reit investment corp 
will be considered excess inclusion  resulting from its ownership of the securitization trusts that are classified as a taxable mortgage pool 
with limited exceptions  excess inclusion is always subject to tax because it cannot be offset by other deductions or by net operating losses 
excess inclusion is primarily caused by the securitization trust utilizing cash  that otherwise would have been paid to the holder of the residual interest certificate  to make payments to other security holders thereby paying down the principal balance of the asset backed securities in order to create or maintain over collateralization 
in the future  we expect to continue to receive income from excess inclusion 
dividends received deduction 
delta financial and delta funding corporation may exclude from its income of dividends received from their consolidated subsidiaries 
no dividends received deduction is available for dividends received from renaissance reit investment corp 
however  a dividends paid deduction is available to renaissance reit investment corp 
for qualifying dividend payments 
taxation as a reit although delta financial has not elected to be taxed as a reit  we have elected to have one of our subsidiaries renaissance reit investment corp 
to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with its taxable year ended december  by using renaissance reit investment corp 
in connection with our securitizations  we are able to structure our securitizations as debt for tax  which more closely conforms to gaap accounting treatment 
renaissance reit investment corp 
must comply with several qualification tests on a continuous basis in order to maintain its reit status  including asset  income  distribution and ownership tests 
the asset test  which must be met on a quarterly basis  requires that at least of its assets are represented by interests in real property  cash and government securities 
there are certain other restrictions on the composition of the other assets that can be owned 
the income test  which must be met on annual basis  requires that at least of the gross income must come from real estate sources and that at least of the gross income must come from real estate sources and certain other sources that are specified in the code 
the distribution test requires the distribution of at least of its annual reit taxable income to stockholders comprised of common stock owned by us and preferred stock owned by individual shareholders primarily within the time frame set forth in the code 
the ownership test requires that not more than in value of the outstanding shares are owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined code to include certain entities after applying certain attribution rules 
if these requirements are met  a reit generally will not be subject to federal or state income taxation at the corporate level with respect to the reit taxable income it distributes to its stockholders 
the reit may retain up to of its reit taxable income and pay corporate income taxes on this retained income while continuing to maintain its reit status 
state and local taxation we are subject to tax in the various states in which we operate  with new york being the state which has the most significant tax impact on us 
new york state taxation 
we are subject to the new york state franchise tax in annual amount equal to the greater of a of entire net income allocable to new york state  or b the applicable alternative tax 
the alternative tax is generally the greater of a of our alternative entire net income  b 
of capital allocable to new york state  or c a fixed amount up to a maximum of  entire net income is similar to federal taxable income  subject to certain modifications  and alternative entire net income is equal to entire net income without certain adjustments 
delta financial and its subsidiaries excluding renaissance reit investment corp 
and its subsidiary file a combined return 
we do business within the metropolitan transportation business tax district the district  which is comprised of the counties of new york  bronx  kings  richmond  dutchess  nassau  orange  putnam  rockland  suffolk and westchester 
a tax surcharge is imposed on business corporations doing business within the district and has been applied since the district tax rate is on the tax described above  subject to modification in certain circumstances  and is scheduled to expire for tax years ending on or after december  delaware taxation 
delta financial  as a delaware holding company not earning income in the state of delaware  is exempted from corporate income tax 
however  the holding company is required to file an annual report with  and pay an annual franchise tax to  the state of delaware 
results of operations our results of operations reflect our change from gain on sale accounting to portfolio accounting effective in the first quarter of accordingly  our financial statements from prior years may be of limited use in evaluating our operating results
