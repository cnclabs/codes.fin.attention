the discussion and analysis below includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described in part i  item a that could cause our actual results of operations  performance and business prospects and opportunities in and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by those forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report 
overview we provide workers compensation insurance coverage for prescribed benefits that employers are required to provide to their employees who may be injured in the course of their employment 
we currently provide workers compensation insurance to customers in the maritime  adr and state act markets 
on september   seabright acquired pointsure and the renewal rights and substantially all of the operating assets  systems and employees of  the eagle entities from lmc  their ultimate parent 
we refer to eagle pacific  pacific eagle and pointsure collectively as our predecessor 
in connection with the acquisition  seabright also purchased keic  a shell company in run off that was acquired from lmc for its workers compensation licenses in states and the district of columbia 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the acquisition will prospectively affect our results of operations in certain respects 
the aggregate acquisition costs  including the transaction costs of approximately million  have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired based upon estimates of their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition  to minimize our exposure to any past business underwritten by keic  we entered into the adverse development cover 
see the discussion under the heading our history in part i  item of this annual report 
to support lmc s obligations under the adverse development cover  lmc funded a trust account at the time of the acquisition in the amount of million as collateral for lmc s potential future obligations to us under the adverse development cover 
the amount on deposit in the trust account was increased to million on december  and totaled million at december  if lmc is placed in receivership and the amount held in the collateralized reinsurance trust is inadequate to satisfy the obligations of lmc to us under the adverse development cover  it is unlikely that we would recover any future amounts owing by lmc to us 
for periods ended on or before september   the financial information of our predecessor discussed below represents the combined financial results of eagle pacific  pacific eagle and pointsure 
for periods ended after september   the financial information presented below represents the consolidated financial results of seabright and its subsidiaries  seabright insurance company and pointsure 
our premiums before the acquisition are generally not comparable to our premiums after the acquisition because we acquired renewal rights and not the underlying policies as of the date of the acquisition 
aspects of our business that are comparable with the business of our predecessor include the loss ratio and expense ratio 
we believe that our loss ratio is comparable to that of our predecessor because we are insuring accounts with the same type of risk exposure in essentially the same jurisdictions as our predecessor  and we are using the same risk selection rules  underwriting guidelines and pricing models that our predecessor used 
we believe that our expense ratio is comparable to that of our predecessor because we acquired the work force and substantially all of the operating assets of our predecessor  and we are following the same business model as our predecessor  which was developed by our current management 
aspects of our business that are not comparable with the business of our predecessor include premiums earned  investment income  service income and geographic territory 
for example  our net premiums earned for the periods immediately following the acquisition were lower than the net premiums earned for the periods immediately prior to the acquisition because we did not earn any 
table of contents premium on any of our predecessor s policies that were in force at september  our investment income is not comparable to the investment income of our predecessor because our predecessor had a significant portion of investments in cash and cash equivalents for the years presented in the selected financial information table 
in contrast  our investment portfolio consists mostly of investment grade fixed income securities  which have higher yields than cash and cash equivalents 
our service income is not comparable to the service income of our predecessor because our predecessor provided only limited claims handling services for certain affiliates of lmc 
in contrast  we are providing claims handling as well as policy administration and accounting services for our predecessor 
our geographic territory is not comparable to that of our predecessor because we have expanded into new territories where our predecessor did not have direct operations 
for example  in we opened offices in chicago  illinois and tampa  florida to facilitate our expansion plans into the great lakes and the southeast coastal regions 
principal revenue and expense items we derive our revenue from premiums earned  service fee income  net investment income and net realized gains and losses from investments 
premiums earned gross premiums written include all premiums billed and unbilled by an insurance company during a specified policy period 
premiums are earned over the terms of the related policies 
at the end of each accounting period  the portion of the premiums that are not yet earned is included in unearned premiums and is realized as revenue in subsequent periods over the remaining terms of the policies 
our policies typically have terms of months 
thus  for example  for a policy that is written on july   one half of the premiums would be earned in and the other half would be earned in premiums earned is the earned portion of our net premiums written 
net premiums written is the difference between gross premiums written and premiums ceded or paid to reinsurers ceded premiums written 
our gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums and assumed premiums before the effect of ceded reinsurance 
assumed premiums are premiums that we have received from another company under a reinsurance agreement or from an authorized state mandated pool 
we earn our direct premiums written from our maritime  adr and state act customers 
we also earn a small portion of our direct premiums written from employers who participate in the washington maritime assigned risk plan 
we immediately cede of those premiums  net of our expenses  and of the losses in connection with that business to the plan 
we do not include premiums from the washington maritime assigned risk plan in our direct premiums written because it is not indicative of our core business or material to our results of operation 
claims service income substantially all of our claims service income is from contracts we have with lmc to provide claims handling services for the policies written by the eagle entities prior to the acquisition 
the claims service income we receive for providing these services approximates our costs and will substantially decrease over the next several years as transactions related to the eagle entities diminish 
other service income following the acquisition  we entered into servicing arrangements with lmc to provide policy administration and accounting services for the policies written by the eagle entities prior to the acquisition 
the fee income we receive for providing these services approximates our costs and will substantially decrease over the next several years as transactions related to the eagle entities diminish 

table of contents net investment income and realized gains and losses on investments we invest our statutory surplus and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities including unearned premiums and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses in cash  cash equivalents  fixed income and equity securities 
our investment income includes interest earned on our invested assets 
realized gains and losses on invested assets are reported separately from net investment income 
we earn realized gains when invested assets are sold for an amount greater than their amortized cost in the case of fixed maturity securities and recognize realized losses when investment securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment or sold for an amount less than their carrying value 
our expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses loss and loss adjustment expenses represent our largest expense item and include claim payments made  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses in our insurance subsidiary  we refer to the expenses that we incur to underwrite risks as underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses 
underwriting expenses consist of commission expenses  premium taxes and fees and other underwriting expenses incurred in writing and maintaining our business 
commission expenses we pay commission expense in our insurance subsidiary to our brokers for the premiums that they produce for us 
premium taxes and fees we pay state and local taxes based on premiums  licenses and fees  assessments  and contributions to workers compensation security funds 
other underwriting expenses other underwriting expenses consist of general administrative expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  rent and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately  and boards  bureaus and assessments of statistical agencies for policy service and administration items such as rating manuals  rating plans and experience data 
interest expense included in other expense is interest expense we incur on million in surplus notes that our insurance subsidiary issued in may the interest expense is paid quarterly in arrears 
the interest expense for each interest payment period is based on the three month libor rate two london banking days prior to the interest payment period plus basis points 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross premiums written 
gross premiums written were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
we began writing new insurance contracts on october  and began renewing some of the existing contracts of our predecessor expiring after that date 
the approximately million of net proceeds received from the initial public offering of our common stock in january  of which approximately million was contributed to seabright insurance company  allowed us to expand our business to new territories and in 
table of contents our niche markets 
california continues to be our largest market  accounting for approximately million of our direct premiums written in during  we opened offices in chicago  illinois and tampa  florida 
we expect to see significant contributions from those markets in net premiums written 
net premiums written totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
net premiums written were affected by premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements 
ceded written premiums in totaled million  or of gross premiums written  compared to million  or of gross premiums written  in our reinsurance program was renewed on october  at rates that are lower than rates under the prior reinsurance contracts  in part because of changes in our limits and retention 
also  the october treaties provide for premiums to be ceded on an earned basis  whereas premiums were ceded on both a gross premiums written and gross premiums earned basis under the prior treaties 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
we record the entire annual policy premium as unearned premium when written and earn the premium over the life of the policy  which is generally twelve months 
because we acquired renewal rights and not policies in the acquisition  our actual results for the year ended december  did not reflect premiums earned on any policies written prior to september   the date of the acquisition 
consequently  the ratio of net premiums earned to net premiums written increased from in to in net investment income 
net investment income was million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
average invested assets increased million from million in to million in approximately million of the increase resulted from the initial public offering of our common stock in january net investment income as a percentage of average invested assets rose from in to in  reflecting the rising interest rate environment 
service income 
service income was million in compared to million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
our service income resulted primarily from service arrangements we have with lmc for claims processing services  policy administration and administrative services we performed for the eagle entities insurance policies 
average monthly fees declined as the volume of work required for policy administration decreased as a result of the run off of our predecessor s business 
other income 
other income totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
other income derived primarily from the operations of pointsure  our non insurance subsidiary 
loss and loss adjustment expenses 
loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
the higher loss and loss adjustment expenses in are attributable to the increase in premiums earned for the period 
our net loss ratio in and remained flat at 
as of december   we had recorded a receivable of approximately million for adverse loss development under the adverse development cover since the date of the acquisition 
we do not expect this receivable to have any material effect on our future cash flows if lmc fails to perform its obligations under the adverse development cover 
at december   we had access to approximately million under the collateralized reinsurance trust in the event that lmc fails to satisfy its obligations under the adverse development cover 
see the discussion under the heading our history in part i  item of this annual report 
underwriting expenses 
underwriting expenses totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
our net underwriting expense ratio was in compared to in net commissions as a percentage of premiums earned increased from in to in assumed commissions from state mandated insurance pools 
table of contents accounted for the majority of this increase  offset by a reduction in the percentage of ceded commissions 
net direct commissions as a percentage of premiums earned equaled approximately in  down slightly from in other underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums earned were in and in other expenses 
other expenses totaled million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase resulted primarily from higher expenses associated with the operations of pointsure  our non insurance company subsidiary  interest expense on million of surplus notes issued by our insurance subsidiary in may and increases in franchise tax and other professional services 
federal income tax expense 
our effective tax rate in was compared to in our effective tax rate for was lower than the statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of tax exempt interest income 
the effective tax rate increased in primarily as a result of a reduction in the proportion of investment income generated from investments in tax exempt bonds and a related true up in the amount of taxes due with our federal income tax return 
net income 
net income totaled million in compared to million in the increase in net income resulted primarily from the increase in premiums earned and investment income for the period  offset by related increases in loss and loss adjustment expenses  underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses  and other expenses  including interest expense related to the surplus notes and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition 
year ended december  compared to three months ended december  and predecessor nine months ended september  the results for the year ended december  and the three month period ended december  are the results of operations of the company  while the results for the nine months ended september  are the results of operations of our predecessor 
in certain respects  our predecessor s results of operations before the acquisition are not comparable to our results after the acquisition  because we acquired renewal rights and not the underlying policies as of the date of the acquisition 
see overview 
from january  through december   we had customers renew under the renewal rights that we acquired in the acquisition 
the customers who exercised their renewal rights represent approximately of those that were offered renewal terms  and accounted for approximately million in direct written premium for the year ended december  policies are generally written for a twelve month period with policy premium included in revenue in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
our predecessor s results include premiums earned in on policies written in and prior 
gross premiums written 
gross premiums written were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
we began writing new insurance contracts on october  and began renewing some of the existing contracts of our predecessor expiring after that date 
the increase in gross premiums written was due primarily to our a excellent rating from am best in  in comparison to our predecessor s rating of b very good in the prior period and our expansion in california state act contractor business 
net premiums written 
net premiums written totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
net premiums written are affected by premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements 
ceded written premiums for the year ended december  totaled million  or of gross premiums written 
our predecessors ceded written premiums for the nine months ended september  totaled million  or of gross premiums written 
our predecessor s premiums ceded were impacted by the quota share reinsurance agreement with lmc 
our 
table of contents reinsurance contracts provide for the ceding of premiums on both a gross premiums written and gross premiums earned basis 
net premiums earned 
net premiums earned were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
as previously discussed  we believe this increase is due primarily to the additional business we were able to write as a result of our improved am best rating over that held by our predecessor and our expansion in california state act contractor business 
we record the entire annual policy premium as unearned premium when written and earn the premium over the life of the policy  which is generally twelve months 
because we acquired renewal rights and not policies in the acquisition  our actual results for the year ended december  and the three months ended december  do not reflect premiums earned on any policies written prior to september   the date of the acquisition 
net investment income 
net investment income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   resulting in a period over period increase of million  or 
our predecessor had million more in average invested assets for the nine months ended september  than we had for the year ended december  however  as a result of our predecessor s realignment of its portfolio in from fixed income securities to more short term investments  our predecessor s yield on average invested assets for the nine months ended september  was approximately compared to our yield on average invested assets for the year ended december  of approximately 
service income 
service income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
our service income results from service arrangements we have with lmc for claims processing services  policy administration and administrative services we perform for the eagle entities insurance policies 
average monthly fees are declining as the volume of work required for policy administration decreases as a result of the run off of our predecessor s business 
our predecessor s service income resulted from claim service fees for handling policyholder claims for certain lmc subsidiaries in alaska and hawaii where those subsidiaries did not have claims offices 
other income 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
our other income as well as our predecessor s other income resulted primarily from the operations of our non insurance subsidiary 
loss and loss adjustment expenses 
loss and loss adjustment expenses totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
the higher loss and loss adjustment expenses for the year ended december  are attributable to the increase in premiums earned for the period 
our loss ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s loss ratio of for the nine months ended september  our loss ratio decreased from in the three months ended december  to in the year ended december  because we acquired substantially all of the workforce of our predecessor in connection with the acquisition but none of our predecessor s existing premiums  the costs to operate our claims department as a percentage of net premiums earned  in our initial stages of growth  are greater than they would have been had we been in existence for a full months 
as of december   we had recorded a receivable of approximately million for adverse loss development under the adverse development cover since the date of the acquisition 
we do not expect this receivable to have any 
table of contents material effect on our future cash flows if lmc fails to perform its obligations under the adverse development cover 
at december   we have access to approximately million under the collateralized reinsurance trust in the event that lmc fails to satisfy its obligations under the adverse development cover 
see the discussion under the heading our history in part i  item of this annual report 
underwriting expenses 
underwriting expenses totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s million for the nine months ended september   representing an increase of million  or 
our underwriting expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to our predecessor s underwriting expense ratio of for the nine months ended september  the increase in the underwriting expense ratio resulted primarily from the fact that we have increased our staffing levels and related expenses in preparation for anticipated growth of our business 
our predecessor s operations during the nine months ended september  were not expanding  as the future of the company at that time was uncertain 
other expenses 
other expenses totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s other expenses of million for the nine months ended september   representing a period over period increase of million  or 
the increase resulted primarily from the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition  higher expenses associated with the operations of pointsure  our non insurance company subsidiary  and interest expense on million of surplus notes issued by our insurance subsidiary in may our predecessor s other expenses consist primarily of operating expenses for pointsure 
federal income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to our predecessor s effective tax rate of for the nine months ended september  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of tax exempt interest income 
our predecessor s effective tax rate was lower than the statutory tax rate of primarily as a result of a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
net income 
net income was million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the three months ended december  and our predecessor s net income of million for the nine months ended september  the increase in net income resulted primarily from the increase in premiums earned and investment income for the period  offset by related increases in loss and loss adjustment expenses  underwriting acquisition and insurance expenses  and other expenses  including interest expense related to the surplus notes and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition 
predecessor nine months ended september  compared to predecessor year ended december  gross premiums written 
our predecessor s gross premiums written was million for the nine months ended september   compared to million in gross premiums written for the year ended december  our predecessor s average monthly gross premiums decreased in the nine months ended september  compared to the decrease represents the net of the positive impact of our predecessor s price increases averaging for the nine months ended september   offset by the negative impact of our predecessor s am best financial strength rating downgrade to b in december net premiums written 
our predecessor had million in net premiums written for the nine months ended september   compared to million for the year ended december  our predecessor s average monthly net premiums written of million for the nine months ended september  compared to million in average monthly net premiums written for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to the termination on january  of our 
table of contents predecessor s inter company quota share reinsurance agreements with lmc  which required our predecessor to cede to lmc of the premiums written after external reinsurance  of the net retained liabilities  after application of all external reinsurance  and of underwriting expenses for all policies written by our predecessor from january  through december  net premiums earned 
our predecessor had net premiums earned of million for the nine months ended september  compared to million for the year ended december  our predecessor s average monthly net premiums earned of million for the nine months ended september  compared to million in average monthly net premiums earned for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the termination on january  of our predecessor s inter company quota share reinsurance agreements with lmc 
for policies incepting january  and thereafter  since our predecessor was no longer ceding of premium to lmc  our predecessor recorded the entire annual policy premium when the premium was written  but earned the premium over the life of the policy  generally twelve months 
since net premiums earned are relatively low until a company has been writing policies for a full policy cycle  the difference between written and earned is significant in the early stages 
net investment income 
our predecessor s net investment income was million for the nine months ended september  compared to million for the year ended december  the average net yield declined from in to for the nine months ended september  this decline in yield was due primarily to the realignment of our predecessor s portfolio in from fixed income securities to more short term investments  which carry lower interest rates than fixed income securities 
cash and short term investments made up approximately of our predecessor s portfolio at september   compared to at december  net realized gains losses on investments 
our predecessor s realized gain on investments was  for the nine months ended september   compared to million in realized losses for the year ended december  in our predecessor realigned its portfolio with a greater emphasis on cash and short term investments  which resulted in approximately million in realized losses from the sale of securities with values that had declined substantially below their cost 
in addition  our predecessor adjusted the carrying value of investments in equity securities by million for other than temporary impairments 
claims service income 
our predecessor s claims service income was  for the nine months ended september   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the approximate decline in average monthly service fee income resulted from a decline in claims serviced for lmc  as lmc stopped writing new business in and the existing claims inventory declined as claims were settled and closed 
other income 
for the nine months ended september   our predecessor s other income was million compared to million for the year ended december  the other income resulted primarily from the operations of our predecessor s non insurance subsidiary  which acted as a managing general underwriter for our predecessor 
in our predecessor s gross premiums were affected by the am best financial strength rating downgrade to b and as a result fees to its non insurance subsidiary declined 
loss and loss adjustment expenses 
for the nine months ended september   the loss and loss adjustment expenses of our predecessor were million  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the loss ratio increased from in to for the nine months ended september  during  our predecessor reported favorable development of million on prior years incurred losses  which was substantially below the favorable development of million recorded in underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses 
for the nine months ended september   our predecessor s underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the underwriting expense ratio decreased from 
table of contents in to in the period 
the expenses and ratios are not comparable because of the quota share reinsurance treaties with lmc  which were cancelled effective january  for all policies incepting after december  on a direct basis the expenses were million for the nine months ended september  or  million per month  compared to million for the year ended december   or million per month 
the decline in average monthly expenses is due to expense control initiatives instituted in plus reduced acquisition expenses in associated with declining monthly premium volume in compared to other expenses 
for the nine months ended september   our predecessor s other expenses were million compared to million for the year ended december  in our predecessor s other expenses consisted primarily of operating expenses for its non insurance company subsidiary 
for the twelve months ended december   our predecessor s other expenses were primarily attributable to the operating expenses of its non insurance subsidiary and to the method of recording the amortization of the deferred gain under our predecessor s loss portfolio transfer agreements with lmc 
federal income tax expense 
our predecessor s effective tax rate was for the nine months ended september   compared to for the year ended december  our predecessor s tax rate was affected by the dividends received deduction and a decrease in the valuation allowance established for deferred tax assets 
the tax rate was affected by the dividends received deduction and an increase in the valuation allowance established for deferred tax assets 
net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
our predecessor s net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the nine months ended september  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  net income loss 
our predecessor s net income for the nine months ended september  was million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   due primarily to the impact of the impairment charge of million recorded in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are underwriting operations  investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
our primary use of funds is to pay claims and operating expenses and to purchase investments 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically over time in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
since we have a limited claims history  we have derived our expected future claim payments from industry and predecessor trends and included a provision for uncertainties 
our investment portfolio as of december  has an effective duration of years with individual maturities extending out to years 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and invest excess cash in securities with appropriate maturity dates to balance against anticipated future claim payments 
as these securities mature  we intend to invest any excess funds with appropriate durations to match against expected future claim payments 
our ability to adequately provide funds to pay claims comes from our disciplined underwriting and pricing standards and the purchase of reinsurance to protect us against severe claims and catastrophic events 
effective october   our reinsurance program provides us with reinsurance protection for each loss occurrence in excess  up to million  subject to various deductibles and exclusions 
see the discussion under the heading reinsurance in part i  item of this annual report 
given industry and predecessor trends  we believe we are sufficiently capitalized to retain our retained losses 
at december   our portfolio was made up almost entirely of investment grade fixed income securities with fair values subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
prior to  we did not invest in common equity securities and we had no exposure to foreign currency risk 
in february  our investment policy was revised to allow for the investment of up to of our investment portfolio in foreign 
table of contents fixed income securities 
while we have structured our investment portfolio to provide an appropriate matching of maturities with anticipated claim payments  if we decide or are required in the future to sell securities in a rising interest rate environment  we would expect to incur losses from such sales 
our insurance subsidiary is required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the national association of insurance commissioners has a risk based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net premiums written 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
as of december   the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiary was in excess of the prescribed risk based capital requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action 
seabright has minimal revenue and expenses 
currently there are no plans to have our insurance subsidiary or pointsure pay a dividend to seabright 
net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million in  which increased million from million in the three months ended december  these increases are mainly attributable to increases in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and reinsurance recoverables  offset by increases in policy acquisition costs deferred and unearned premiums net of premiums receivable  all as a result of our growth 
we used net cash of million for investing activities in compared to million in and million in the three months ended december  the difference between and is primarily attributable to the fact that we invested the net proceeds of million from the initial public offering of our common stock in january the difference between and is primarily attributable to the fact that we invested the net proceeds of million from our initial capital infusion immediately after the acquisition  as well as proceeds of million from the sale of additional shares of convertible preferred stock in june cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  an increase of million from million in  which decreased million from million in the three months ended december  in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering of our common stock 
in  our insurance subsidiary issued an aggregate principal amount of million in floating rate surplus notes due in also in that year  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of additional preferred stock 
in september  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of preferred stock in connection with the acquisition 
in february  we closed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters fees  commissions and offering costs totaling approximately million 
also in february  we contributed million of the net proceeds from this offering to our insurance company subsidiary  which plans to use the capital to expand its business in its core markets and to new territories 
we plan to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes  including supporting the growth of pointsure 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table identifies our contractual obligations by payment due period as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations surplus notes loss and loss adjustment expenses operating lease obligations total the loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period in the table above are based upon the loss and loss adjustment expense estimates as of december  and actuarial estimates of expected payout patterns and are not contractual liabilities as to time certain 
our contractual liability is to provide benefits under the policies we write 
as a result  our calculation of loss and loss adjustment expense payments due by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses generally and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense process  see the heading loss reserves in part i  item of this annual report 
actual payments of loss and loss adjustment expenses by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses vary from actual ultimate claims amounts and as a result of variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
see the discussion under the heading our loss reserves are based on estimates and may be inadequate to cover our actual losses in part i  item a of this annual report for a discussion of the uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers some of these policies to be critical to the presentation of our financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
some of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently  actual results reflected in future periods might differ from these estimates 
the most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses including losses that have occurred but were not reported to the company by the financial reporting date  the amount and recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances  accounting for our adverse development cover  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred taxes  goodwill  intangibles  retrospective premiums  earned but unbilled premiums and the impairment of investments 
the following should be read in conjunction with the notes to our financial statements 

table of contents unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses represent our estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on known facts and circumstances 
included in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are amounts for case based claims  including estimates of future developments on these claims  and claims incurred but not yet reported to us  second injury fund  allocated claim adjustment expenses and unallocated claim adjustment expenses 
we use actuarial methodologies to assist us in establishing these estimates  including judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to achieve ultimate resolution  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors that are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the cost of unsettled and unreported claims  the ultimate liability may differ from the original estimate 
these estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s operating results 
because of the relative immaturity of our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  actuarial techniques are applied that use the historical experience of our predecessor as well as industry information in the analysis of our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses represent the portion of the loss and loss adjustment expenses that is assumed by reinsurers 
these recoverables are reported on our balance sheet separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders and ceding companies 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based in part on the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts  which could be subject to interpretations that differ from ours based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
adverse development cover the unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense subject to the adverse development cover with lmc is calculated on a quarterly basis using generally accepted actuarial methodologies 
amounts recoverable in excess of acquired reserves at september  are recorded gross in unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  with a corresponding amount receivable from the seller 
amounts are shown net in the income statement 
deferred policy acquisition costs we defer commissions  premium taxes and certain other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to the recognition of premiums earned 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of these deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  anticipated losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs we expect to incur as the premium is earned 
judgments as to ultimate recoverability of these deferred costs are highly dependent upon estimated future costs associated with the premiums written 
deferred taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if necessary  we would establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
retrospective premiums retrospective premiums for primary and reinsured risks are included in income as earned on a pro rata basis over the effective period of the respective policies 
earned premiums on retrospectively rated policies are based on the company s estimate of loss experience as of the measurement date 
unearned premiums are deferred and include that portion of premiums written that is applicable to the unexpired period of the policies in force and estimated adjustments of premiums on policies that have retrospective rating endorsements 
retrospectively rated policies accounted for approximately of premiums written in and approximately of premiums written in earned but unbilled premiums we estimate the amount of premiums that have been earned but are unbilled at the end of the period by analyzing historical earned premium adjustments made and applying an adjustment percentage against premiums earned for the period 
impairment of investment securities impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when the fair value of a security declines to below our cost and is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our fixed maturity portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
a number of criteria are considered during this process  including but not limited to the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value and specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
in general  we focus on those securities whose fair value was less than of their amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  for six or more consecutive months 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the carrying amount of the underlying investment 
significant changes in the factors considered when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
revised  share based payment  was issued in december statement no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the 
table of contents approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r for our fiscal year that began on january  for periods prior to adoption  as permitted by sfas no 
 we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method as detailed in opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in note n of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer 
we address this risk by investing generally in fixed income securities which are rated a or higher by standard poor s 
we also independently  and through our outside investment managers  monitor the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed income securities in the portfolio 
to limit our exposure to risk we employ stringent diversification rules that limit the credit exposure to any single issuer or business sector 
interest rate risk we had fixed income investments with a fair value of million at december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage the exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of the liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk 
it illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of fixed income investments to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of our fixed income portfolio and stockholders equity 
hypothetical percentage increase estimated decrease in change in stockholders hypothetical change in interest rates fair value fair value equity in thousands basis point increase basis point increase no change basis point decrease basis point decrease
