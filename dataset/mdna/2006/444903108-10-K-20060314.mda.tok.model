item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview human genome sciences is a biopharmaceutical company with a pipeline of novel protein and antibody drugs directed toward large markets that have significant unmet medical needs 
our mission is to discover  develop  manufacture and market innovative drugs that serve patients with unmet medical needs  with a primary focus on protein and antibody products 
we are conducting clinical trials with a number of our products 
our current focus is to advance clinical trials in two main therapeutic areas immunology infectious disease and oncology 
additional products are in clinical development by companies with which we are collaborating or have out licensed development rights 
we have developed and continue to enhance the resources necessary to achieve our goal of becoming a fully integrated global biopharmaceutical company 
we have expanded our manufacturing facilities to allow us to produce larger quantities of therapeutic protein and antibody drugs for clinical development 
we have completed construction and are beginning the validation phase of a large scale manufacturing facility to increase our capacity for therapeutic protein and antibody drug production 
we anticipate placing the facility into operational service in the second half of we are strengthening our commercial operations staff  and our intent is to add marketing and sales staff as needed as our products approach commercialization 
we have relationships with a number of leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage our strengths and to gain access to complementary technologies and sales and marketing infrastructure 
some of these partnerships provide us  and have provided us  with research funding  licensing fees  milestone payments and royalty payments as products are developed and commercialized 
in some cases  we also are entitled to certain commercialization  co development  revenue sharing and other product rights 
we have not received any significant product sales revenue or royalties from product sales and any significant revenue from product sales or from royalties on product sales in the next several years is uncertain 
to date  all of our revenue relates to payments made under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline gsk and  to a lesser extent  other agreements 
in the third quarter of  gsk exercised its option to co develop and co commercialize two of our products  lymphostat b and hgs etr under the terms of a agreement  we and gsk will share equally in phase and development costs  and will share equally in sales and marketing expenses and profits of any product that is commercialized  under a co development and commercialization agreement  the remaining terms of which are being negotiated by the parties 
we may not receive any future payments and may not be able to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
we have entered into a two phase contract to supply abthrax tm  a human monoclonal antibody developed for use in the treatment of anthrax disease  with the us government 
under the first phase of the contract  we have supplied ten grams of abthrax to the us department of health and human services hhs for comparative in vitro and in vivo testing 
under the second phase of the contract  the us government has the option to place an order by september for up to  doses of abthrax for the strategic national stockpile  for use in the treatment of anthrax disease 
the hhs comparative testing results  along with our own preclinical and clinical study results  will form the basis of the us government s decision process for exercising its option for product for the strategic national stockpile 
we do not know whether the us government will purchase abthrax  and if it does  the timing  extent and amount of such purchases 
we expect that any significant revenue or income for at least the next several years may be limited to investment income  payments under various collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  payments from the sale of product rights and other payments from other collaborators and licensees under existing or future arrangements  to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on clinical trials required for the development of antibody and protein product candidates 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and significant losses over the next several years unless we are able to realize additional revenues overview continued under existing or new agreements 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and will likely fluctuate sharply 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
such judgments are often the result of a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
see note b of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we currently believe the following accounting policies to be critical investments 
we account for investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including but not limited to the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market values recover  which may be maturity 
if management determines that such an impairment exists we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
if we held investments that were classified as held to maturity securities  these would be carried at amortized cost rather than at fair market value 
if we held investments that were classified as trading securities  these would be carried at fair market value  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings for any change in fair market value 
we classify those marketable securities that are likely to be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the intent and ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as non current marketable securities 
leases 
we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance and maintenance 
one of our operating leases is commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset to the lessee 
under this lease  we provide a residual value guarantee which guarantees the lessor that the residual value of the leased asset will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
we have determined that the entity that owns the property has sufficient substance such that it can be treated as an unrelated entity to us and  accordingly  does not require consolidation into our financial statements 
further  we have determined that the terms of the property lease qualify it as an operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  this synthetic lease is treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
changes in the equity participation of the third parties or our obligation under the agreement could affect the classification of this lease from critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued operating to capital 
in that event  we would include both the cost and debt associated with the property on our consolidated balance sheet 
revenue 
we recognize revenue from non refundable up front license fees where we have continuing involvement to provide access to our technology ratably over the period of obligation in accordance with the guidance provided in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
our revenues with transgene  sa transgene are being recognized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the ten year term of the agreement or prorated upon the selection of genes by transgene 
our up front license fee with glaxosmithkline gsk in connection with our albugon product gsk albugon agreement is being recognized ratably over the estimated seven year clinical development period 
our other revenues in have been recognized in full upon receipt as we have no continuing obligation 
to date  revenue associated with performance milestones has been recognized upon achievement of the milestones  as defined in the applicable agreement 
research and development 
research and development expenses primarily include related salaries  outside services  materials and supplies  and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
our drug development expenses include accruals for clinical site and clinical research organization cro costs 
estimates of the incurred to date but not yet received invoices must be made for clinical site and cro costs in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
stock compensation 
we have stock option plans under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the fair market value on the date of grant 
we account for grants to employees in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the option and is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the option 
because our options must be granted with an exercise price no less than the quoted market value of our common stock at the date of grant  we recognize no stock compensation expense at the time of the grant in accordance with apb no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule that amended the adoption dates for sfas r  allowing us to implement sfas r at the beginning of our next fiscal year  or january  the sec rule does not otherwise change the accounting required by sfas r 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
in accordance with statement r  we will begin recording compensation expense for all option awards beginning january  under the modified prospective method 
we have provided pro forma disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements of our net loss and net loss per share as if we used the fair value method under fas the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
in the event any of these inputs increases from levels  the fair value of new stock options on a per share basis will increase 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the option require our judgment 
the aggregate stock option expense to be recognized in and beyond is a function of the fair value associated with the vesting of existing grants as well as the new grants 
this aggregate option expense may increase or decrease depending upon the quantity of options vesting and their relative fair value  net of option cancellations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates continued use of estimates 
in  we engaged in restructuring actions and activities associated with expense reduction measures and operational improvement initiatives  which required us to make significant estimates in several areas including severance and other employee separation costs  the realizable values of assets deemed redundant or excess and the ability to generate sublease income which involves judgment as to our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated 
at december   the restructuring liability of million represented our best estimate of the obligations we expected to incur in connection with these actions  but was subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 
most of the transactions with respect to the restructuring have been completed and settled at amounts that approximated their estimates 
should the remaining restructuring liability of million as of december  differ from our estimates  the amount of restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenues consisted primarily of the recognition of million of milestone payments from gsk related to the company s october outlicensing agreement for gsk albugon tm and the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene 
the revenues consisted primarily of the recognition of million from transgene and a million milestone payment from gsk relating to our agreement with gsk gsk agreement 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  pharmaceutical sciences  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to a greater level of activity  including toxicology and assay development  for hgs etr  lymphostat b and other drug candidates  and costs incurred by the cogenesys division 
our pharmaceutical sciences costs  where we focus on improving formulation  process development and production methods  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to the decline in activity for lymphostat b  hgs trj and hgs etr  partially offset by increased activity for albuferon 
our manufacturing costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in production of lymphostat b and hgs trj  partially offset by the production of hgs etr  albuferon and other products 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the cost of increased activity for albuferon  including the cost of initiating a significant new clinical trial 
the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors 
the charge for restructuring of million for the year ended december  related to our first quarter of decision to sharpen our focus on our most promising drug candidates 
in order to reduce results of operations continued years ended december  and continued significantly future expenses  and thus enable us to dedicate more resources to the most promising drugs  we reduced staff  streamlined operations and consolidated facilities 
the charge consisted of million for the consolidation of facilities  million related to the retirement of our former chairman and ceo and million for employee severance benefits 
see note m of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to consulting costs relating to a review of our pipeline and commercialization strategies conducted during and separation costs associated with the departure of a senior executive  aggregating million 
investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to lower average cash  short term investment and marketable security balances and reduced yield due to declining interest rates in our portfolio 
investment income also includes realized net losses on our short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments of million and a realized net gain of million relating to the sale of our equity investment in transgene for this compares to a net realized gain of million along with a realized net gain of approximately million relating to sale of our equity investments in ciphergen biosystems  inc ciphergen  cambridge antibody technology ltd 
cat and transgene during see note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the yield on our investments was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in we believe investment income will continue to be lower than the prior year as cash and investment balances are likely to be lower in than interest expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the replacement of existing debt with more favorable interest bearing notes in and assuming the cost of the manufacturing facility reaches approximately million when validation is complete in the second half of  total capitalized interest for all years could approximate million at the time the facility is placed in service 
interest expense  before capitalized interest  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in we completed the private placement of million of subordinated convertible notes 
we used the net proceeds to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of million of and notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million as of december  in  we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of this debt of million  including unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the repurchased debt 
in  we completed the private placement of million of subordinated convertible notes 
we used the net proceeds to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of million of notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of this debt of million  net of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the repurchased debt 
as a result of the issuance of new notes at a lower interest rate  and the repurchase of higher rate notes  we believe interest expense will be approximately million lower in than in  excluding the impact of capitalized interest 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the decreased loss for compared to reflects increased revenues and the absence of restructuring charges  partially offset by increased operating expenses and reduced net investment income 
the increased operating expenses for primarily include an increase in clinical development costs results of operations continued years ended december  and continued and a non cash stock option modification charge of million related to the departure of two senior executives  partially offset by decreases in other areas 
years ended december  and revenues 
we had revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the revenues consisted primarily of the recognition of million from our collaboration with transgene and a million milestone payment from gsk relating to our agreement 
we also recognized million of the million up front license fee from gsk relating to the gsk albugon agreement 
the revenues consisted of the recognition of an aggregate of million in revenue received from pfizer  inc pfizer  genentech and medimmune  inc medimmune  million recognized from our collaboration with transgene  and a million milestone payment from gsk under the gsk agreement 
expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we track our research and development expenditures by type of cost incurred research  drug development  manufacturing and clinical development costs 
our research costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to reduced general research activity and staff in the study of preclinical therapeutic protein and antibody drug candidates 
our drug development costs  where we evaluate ways to develop or improve our product candidates and production processes  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to decreased process development activities for abthrax and other projects  partially offset by increased activity for lymphostat b 
our manufacturing costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the increased production activities for hgs trj and payments made to a third party manufacturer to provide materials in support of our increased lymphostat b clinical activities 
our clinical development costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to the cost of continuing ongoing trials from for lymphostat b as well as initiating new trials in the research and development expenditures noted above are categorized by functional area 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area  rather than on a per project basis 
for this reason  we do not maintain a formal accounting system that captures or allocates all costs  both direct and indirect  on a per project basis 
therefore  we do not believe that our available project by project information would form a reasonable basis for disclosure to investors

see note m of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to lower facility costs achieved through the consolidation of space and reduced marketing research costs 
results of operations continued years ended december  and continued investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to lower average cash and investment balances and reduced yield due to declining interest rates in our portfolio 
investment income also includes realized net gains on our short term investments and restricted investments of million and million for and  respectively  along with a realized net gain of approximately million relating to sale of our equity investments in ciphergen biosystems  inc ciphergen  cambridge antibody technology ltd

the yield on our investments was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  our average cash balance decreased during as a result of our net loss and capital expenditures in interest expense decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to million and million  respectively  of interest capitalized on the construction of the large scale manufacturing facility 
total interest expense  before capitalized interest  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in october  a significant portion of our subordinated convertible notes was repurchased following the issuance of new subordinated convertible notes bearing a lower interest rate 
in  we completed the private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes 
we used the net proceeds to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of million of notes for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in  we recorded a gain on the extinguishment of this debt of million  net of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the repurchased debt 
net income loss 
we recorded a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  the increased loss for compared to reflects an increase in direct research and development expenditures  a decrease in net investment income  and a charge for restructuring  partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses and a gain on extinguishment of debt 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to our net loss  our capital expenditures  most of which related to construction phase costs of our large scale manufacturing facility and the reclassification of million of marketable securities not needed for current operations to non current assets based on our assessment of our ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be to maturity 
see notes b and c of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  which may increase relative to historical levels as we focus on manufacturing and clinical trials required for the development of our active product candidates 
we may improve our working capital position during through the receipt of collaboration fees  transfer of securities between our unrestricted and restricted investments as well as financing or refinancing of our facilities 
in the event our working capital needs for exceed our available working capital  after these or other initiatives  we can utilize our non current marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
we will be evaluating our working capital position on a continual basis 
the amounts of expenditures that will be needed to carry out our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
we have several phase and phase trials under way and expect to initiate additional trials  including phase trials  in the future 
completion of these trials may extend several years or more  but the length of time generally varies liquidity and capital resources continued considerably according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
we estimate that the typical completion periods for our phase  phase and phase trials could span one year  one to two years and two to four years  respectively 
some trials may take considerably longer to complete 
the duration and cost of our clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
our clinical development expenses are impacted by the clinical phase of our drug candidates 
our expenses increase as our drug candidates move to later phases of clinical development 
the status of our clinical projects is as follows clinical trial status as of december  product candidate indication active candidates antibodies lymphostat b rheumatoid arthritis phase phase phase lymphostat b systemic lupus erythematosus phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase hgs etr cancer phase phase phase hgs trj cancer phase phase ccr mab hiv phase abthrax anthrax phase albumin fusion proteins albuferon hepatitis c phase phase phase inactive candidates therapeuticproteins blys immunodeficiency phase mirostipen cancer phase repifermin mucositis phase repifermin wound healing phase albumin fusion proteins albuleukin cancer phase other lymphorad cancer phase phase includes only those candidates for which an investigational new drug ind application has been filed with the fda 
clinical trial status defined as when patients are being dosed 
initial phase trial completed  extension safety study ongoing 
initial phase trial completed  extension safety study ongoing  phase planning under way 
us government has executed the first phase of the contract in which we supplied ten grams of abthrax to the us department of health and human services hhs for comparative in vitro and in vivo testing 
under the second phase of the contract  the u 
s 
government has the option to place an order by september for up to  doses of abthrax 
further clinical development pending and dependent on the us government 
clinical development discontinued in or prior 
clinical development discontinued in liquidity and capital resources continued we identify our potential drug candidates by conducting numerous preclinical studies 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each drug candidate 
based upon the results from our trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain indications or certain drugs in order to concentrate our resources on more promising drug candidates 
we are advancing a number of drug candidates  antibodies and albumin fusion proteins  in part to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
in addition  our manufacturing plants have been designed to enable multi product manufacturing capability 
accordingly  we believe our future financial commitments  including those for preclinical  clinical or manufacturing activities  are not substantially dependent on any single drug candidate 
should we be unable to sustain a multi product drug pipeline  our dependence on the success of one or a few drug candidates would increase 
we must receive fda clearance to advance each of our products into and through each phase of clinical testing 
moreover  we must receive fda regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all fda requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our drugs or that our drugs and the manufacturing facilities will meet all fda requirements 
in addition  part of our business plan includes collaborating with others 
for example  gsk is developing products as part of our collaboration or licensing with them 
we have no control over the progress of gsk s development plans 
while we have received an aggregate of million from gsk in connection with development milestones met by gsk during  and relating to our gsk agreement  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the likelihood of receiving future milestone or royalty payments under these agreements 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty what impact gsk s decision to jointly develop and commercialize lymphostat b and hgs etr will have on our development costs  in part because joint development agreements must first be concluded 
we also cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current or future collaborations will affect our drug development efforts and therefore  our capital and liquidity requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds and investment income will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities and the magnitude of our discovery program 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
depending upon market and interest rate conditions  we are exploring  and  from time to time  may take actions to strengthen further our financial position 
in this regard  in the third quarter of  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due and we repurchased million in face value of convertible subordinated notes due we may further modify our lease financings and may restructure some or all of our outstanding convertible debt instruments in the future depending upon market and other conditions 
we have certain contractual obligations  including one which is not recorded on our balance sheets  which may have a future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
see off balance sheet arrangements below for additional discussion 
our operating leases  along with our unconditional purchase obligations  are not recorded on our balance sheets 
liquidity and capital resources continued these contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows payments due by period dollars in millions one year two to four to after contractual obligations total or less three years five years five years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases rental obligation for facility lease with residual value guarantee unconditional purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheets total contractual cash obligations contractual interest obligations related to long term debt not included above total  as of december  contractual interest obligations of    and  are due in one year or less  two to three years  four to five years and after five years  respectively 
certain of our current or future lease payments are based upon currently applicable interest rates 
see additional discussion of this facility lease below 
one of our operating leases contains a residual value guarantee described below 
our unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to commitments for capital expenditures  consisting primarily of manufacturing space build out and equipment 
the amounts include approximately million associated with the completion of construction and validation of our construction of our large scale manufacturing facility 
because we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether any of our current collaborations will require us to make future milestone or royalty payments  we have excluded these amounts from the above table 
for additional discussion of our debt obligations  including any make whole premiums and lease commitments  see notes h and i of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately billion  which expire  if unused  by the year we also have available research and development tax credit and other tax credit carry forwards of approximately million  the majority of which will expire  if unused  by the year our unrestricted and restricted funds may be invested in us treasury securities  government agency obligations  high grade corporate debt securities and various money market instruments rated a or better 
such investments reflect our policy regarding the investment of liquid assets  which is to seek a reasonable rate of return consistent with an emphasis on safety  liquidity and preservation of capital 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have one lease agreement for a research and development and administrative facility the traville lease which has been structured as a synthetic lease and is accounted for as an operating lease 
this structure provides us with cost effective financing and future financing flexibility 
none of our directors  officers or employees has any financial interest with regard to this lease arrangement 
the traville lease has a term of approximately seven years beginning in and relates to a research and development and administrative facility located on the traville site in rockville  maryland 
the total financed cost of the traville lease facility is million 
our rent obligation approximates the lessor s debt off balance sheet arrangements continued service costs plus a return on the lessor s equity investment 
the rent under this lease is currently based on the rate for short term commercial paper  but the lessor can lock in a fixed interest rate at any time at our request 
to the extent the lessor does not lock in a fixed interest rate  if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase 
if interest rates decrease  our rent obligations would decrease 
the current floating rate was approximately as of december  our restricted investments with respect to the traville lease and other leases for the existing process development and manufacturing facility are expected to reach approximately million 
these restricted investments will serve as collateral for the duration of the leases 
we are required to restrict investments for the duration of the lease equal to of the full amount of the million financed project cost for the traville lease  or million 
also  in connection with the traville lease  we must maintain minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and certain debt ratios 
in addition  we are required to maintain up to a maximum of million in restricted investments with respect to the process development and manufacturing facility leases 
our restricted investments for all of these leases aggregated million as of december  compared to million as of december  the increase in restricted investments is due to interest earned on the principal balance of restricted investments 
under the traville lease  we have the option to purchase the property during and at the end of the lease term for approximately million 
alternatively  we can cause the property to be sold to third parties 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with this property in the event the net sale proceeds are less than the original financed cost of the facility 
we are contingently liable for the residual value guarantee associated with the traville lease of approximately million 
see note i of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
we have entered into various equipment leases with rental payments aggregating million over the lease terms which range from five to seven years 
we must either purchase the equipment at the end of the initial term at the greater of fair market value or of original cost or  in some cases  extend the term of the lease for an additional year 
we have accounted for these leases as operating leases 
minimum annual rentals are approximately million 
safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements contained in business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the forward looking statements are based on our current intent  belief and expectations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations of a material nature that are subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio may be comprised of low risk us treasuries  government agency obligations  high grade debt having at least an a rating and various money market instruments 
the short term nature of these securities  which currently have an average term of approximately months  significantly decreases the risk of a material loss caused by a market change 
we believe that a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would adversely affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and restricted investments by approximately million  or approximately of the aggregate fair value of million  at december  for these reasons  and because these securities are generally held to maturity  we believe we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt securities held as of december  we believe that any market change related to our investment securities held as of december  is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the yield on comparable two year investments was approximately  as compared to our current portfolio yield of approximately 
however  given the short term nature of these securities  a general decline in interest rates will adversely affect the interest earned from our portfolio as securities mature and are replaced with securities having a lower interest rate 
as of december   the market values of our equity investments in cat and corautus genetics inc corautus were approximately million and million  respectively 
our investment in corautus is subject to equity market risk 
our investment in cat is denominated in pounds sterling and is subject to both foreign currency risk as well as equity market risk 
the facility lease we entered into during requires us to maintain minimum levels of restricted investments as collateral for this facility 
our restricted investments for this lease were slightly higher than the maximum required level of approximately million as of december  together with the requirement to maintain up to approximately million in restricted investments with respect to our process development and manufacturing facility leases  our overall level of restricted investments was approximately million at december  although the market value for these investments may rise or fall as a result of changes in interest rates  we will be required to maintain up to of restricted investments in either a rising or declining interest rate environment 
the rent under the traville lease is based on a floating interest rate 
we can direct the lessor to lock in a fixed interest rate 
as of december   such a fixed rate for four years would be approximately compared to the floating rate as of december  of approximately 
if interest rates increase  our rent obligations would also increase  which would result in an increase in our operating expenses 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the company s convertible subordinated notes because they bear interest at fixed rates 
during  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences europe gmbh hgs europe that is managing our clinical trials and clinical research collaborations in european countries 
although hgs europe s activities are denominated primarily in euros  we believe the foreign currency fluctuation risks for to be immaterial to our operations as a whole 
in february  we established a wholly owned subsidiary  human genome sciences pacific pty ltd 
hgs pacific that is sponsoring our clinical trials in the asiapacific region 
we currently do not anticipate hgs pacific to have any operational activity and therefore we do not believe we will have any foreign currency fluctuation risks for with respect to hgs pacific
