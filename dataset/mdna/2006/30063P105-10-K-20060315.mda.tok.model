overview we are an applied genomics company that develops proprietary dna based technologies for use in the detection of cancer 
we have selected colorectal cancer as the first application of our technologies 
we have licensed certain of our technologies  on an exclusive basis through august  to laboratory corporation of america holdings labcorp for use in a commercial testing service developed by labcorp and marketed under the name pregen plus 
pregen plus is a non invasive stool based dna testing service for the detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
since our inception in february  our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening technologies  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  conducting market studies and analyzing various markets for our technologies  hiring research and clinical personnel  sales personnel  management and other support personnel  raising capital  licensing our proprietary technologies to labcorp  working with labcorp on activities in support of the commercialization of pregen plus  and sales and marketing efforts in support of pregen plus 
we have generated limited operating revenues since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development initiatives  salaries and benefits associated with the hiring of personnel  the initiation of marketing programs and the build out of our sales infrastructure to support the commercialization and marketing of pregen plus 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years as a result of continuing research  development  sales and marketing expenses 
labcorp launched pregen plus commercially in august from the date of launch through december   labcorp had accessioned approximately  pregen plus samples  including approximately  samples during the year ended december  since the commercial launch of pregen plus  labcorp has offered the testing service as an in house developed laboratory test  or homebrew 
homebrew tests have historically been treated as exempt from fda premarket clearance or approval requirements 
on january   the fda sent correspondence to labcorp that focused primarily on effipure but also more broadly on the pregen plus test as a whole and indicated that pregen plus is subject to fda regulation as a medical device 
the fda also indicated that the device cannot be commercially distributed without an appropriate premarket determination from the fda 
labcorp is currently discussing this matter with fda with the goal of arriving at a regulatory and commercial solution that is acceptable to both the fda and labcorp 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not determine that effipure  in whole or in part  requires premarket approval  in which case  labcorp s use of effipure could be delayed  halted or prevented and enforcement action could be initiated which could involve criminal or civil penalties  any of which would impair the commercialization of pregen plus and materially harm our business 
to build material demand for pregen plus  we believe that stool based dna testing must be included in screening guidelines and that substantial funds will likely need to be invested in sales and marketing efforts over the next several years  among other things  to achieve broad patient awareness and acceptance of pregen plus  including its novel sample collection process  to make stool based dna screening a standard of care among prescribing physicians and to educate physicians and their office staffs to facilitate patient compliance 
whether we are able to succeed in building this demand  we believe depends upon numerous factors including whether stool based dna screening is included in screening guidelines and whether we or labcorp invest these sums 
currently  we do not have  and we cannot assure you that labcorp will devote  the funds that we believe are likely necessary to build material demand for pregen plus 
moreover  even if sufficient amounts are invested in sales and marketing efforts  our success will also depend upon a number of factors that are largely out of our control  including the following the regulatory requirements for pregen plus and the timing of any required regulatory filing and approval process  whether labcorp continues to offer pregen plus commercially  inclusion of stool based dna screening in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  material investment in sales and marketing  material investment in product development  acceptance  endorsement and formal policy approval of stool based dna screening for reimbursement by medicare and other third party payors  effective labcorp sales and sales management personnel and processes to educate physician staffs regarding pregen plus and patient compliance  effective exact personnel to educate third party payors  managed care organizations  and technology assessment groups regarding stool based dna screening  patient acceptance of pregen plus  including its novel sample collection process  stool based dna screening becoming a standard of care among prescribing physicians  the impact that the publication of our multi center and other study results and accompanying editorials in a peer reviewed journal have on market acceptance of pregen plus  and the quality and service of the labcorp testing process 
our revenue is comprised of product royalty fees on pregen plus tests sold by labcorp  product revenue from the sale to labcorp of effipure components  which are used by labcorp in processing pregen plus tests  and the amortization of license fees for the licensing of product rights to labcorp under our strategic license agreements 
we expect that product royalty fees and product revenue for will be substantially consistent with amounts recorded in until such time as some or all of the factors outlined above are in place  we do not expect material royalty revenue growth 
we account for pregen plus royalty fees on a cash basis and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have sufficient history and experience to estimate the percentage of pregen plus accessions that will ultimately result in revenue for us 
laboratory operating factors incurred at labcorp such as turnaround times for the testing process  possible pre and post analytical sample and sample processing deficiencies and third party reimbursement all influence whether an accession by labcorp will eventually be recognized as revenue by us 
we recognize our license fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable exclusive license period 
license fee revenue for is expected to be higher than license fee revenue recorded in due to the one time  non cash reduction in license fee revenue of million recorded in the quarter ended june  in connection with the extension of a warrant issued to labcorp 
see complete discussion of the accounting treatment of the labcorp warrant extension in the revenue section of results of operations below 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  research and clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies 
our research and development efforts in will focus on improving the sensitivity and other performance aspects of our stool based dna screening technology for colorectal cancer and thus we do not expect to engage in large scale clinical trials 
however  if we pursue a product development strategy and seek fda approval relating to version ii of our technology  or relating to pregen plus in whole or in part  we may need to invest substantial sums in research or clinical studies associated with such efforts as well as substantial sums in the design and development of one or more stool based dna colorectal cancer screening products 
if we do not pursue this product development strategy  we expect research and development expenses in to be materially consistent with levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses and professional fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to be flat in as compared stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  includes charges resulting from the difference between the exercise price and deemed fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering 
the stock based compensation expense related to options granted prior to our initial public offering was amortized on an accelerated method over the vesting period of the applicable options  which was generally months  and ended in stock based compensation expense also includes common stock awards and stock options granted to non employees  which are recorded at fair value based on the fair value measurement criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
as well as common stock grants made to members of our board of directors as compensation for their services as board members in lieu of cash payments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach to accounting for share based payments in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of the fair value of share based payments is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we plan on adopting sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material effect on our financial statements  in the form of additional compensation expense  on a quarterly and annual basis 
we expect to record total stock based compensation expense of between million and million during in our consolidated statements of operations as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
however  the actual expense recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r may differ materially from this range as a result of changes in the number of options granted annually by our board of directors  the price of our common stock  volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and risk free interest rates as measured at the grant date 
significant accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition 
license fees for the licensing of product rights on initiation of strategic agreements are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the license period 
royalties fees earned on pregen plus tests performed by labcorp are based upon the customer s remittance to labcorp  not the amount billed 
until such time as we have sufficient history and experience to estimate the percentage of pregen plus accessions to labcorp that will ultimately result in revenue for us  we will continue to recognize royalties as labcorp customers make payments 
the timing of payments to labcorp is uncertain because of the variable time lag between invoicing and payment and the number of parties involved in the reimbursement process 
product revenue from the sale of certain components of our effipure technology to labcorp is recognized upon shipment of the components provided that title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable 
we bear the risk of obsolescence related to the effipure inventory 
revenue from milestone and other performance based payments will be recognized as revenue when the milestone or performance is achieved and collection of the receivable is estimable and probable 
patent costs 
patent costs  which consist of related legal fees and disbursements and purchases of intellectual property  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  or upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or when the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the exclusive license period and  to a lesser extent  royalties on labcorp s sales of pregen plus labcorp s colon cancer screening testing service  and sales of effipure units to labcorp 
the decrease in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a one time  non cash reduction in revenue of million recorded in june in connection with the amendment of a warrant originally issued to labcorp in june to purchase  shares of our common stock  at an exercise price of per share the labcorp warrant 
at the time of issuance  the labcorp warrant had an expiration date of june  on june   we entered into an amendment to the labcorp warrant to extend the expiration date of the labcorp warrant to august   which is the expiration date of the exclusive period under our license agreement with labcorp 
all other terms of the labcorp warrant were unaffected 
we assigned a value to the labcorp warrant extension of million using the black scholes option pricing model 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  we recorded the cost of the labcorp warrant extension as a one time  non cash reduction in license fee revenue of million in the quarter ended june  cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the cost of product revenue includes the costs of effipure components while the cost of product royalty revenue represents royalties owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
the increase in the cost of product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was the result of an increase in charges resulting from the write off of excess and expired effipure inventory units  partially offset by a decrease in the number of effipure components shipped to labcorp during the year ended december  versus the year ended december  we recorded charges of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  to write off excess and expired effipure inventory units 
we have entered into several agreements with various suppliers and manufacturers for certain components utilized in the effipure technology which we sell to labcorp 
pursuant to these agreements  we have contractual commitments million at december  to certain effipure contract manufacturers that require us to pay minimum dollar amounts over the life of the commitments  which expire in april as we fulfill these minimum purchase commitments  if test volumes do not keep pace with effipure inventory levels the components of which have a finite useful life  after which time they must be discarded  or if effipure is replaced in commercial use by labcorp  we may need to make additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory 
our reliance on contract manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks  including reduced control over manufacturing capacity and component availability  product completion and delivery times  product quality  manufacturing costs and inadequate or excess inventory levels which could lead to additional charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
as of december   the carrying value of our effipure inventory was million and was recorded under the caption prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
historically  we have managed the supply chain components for the development and sale of effipure to labcorp 
labcorp recently agreed to manage this supply chain itself and to source components necessary for effipure directly from outside vendors or  if appropriate  to develop one or more of such components itself 
while labcorp has access to certain levels of inventory of effipure  there can be no assurance that labcorp will be able to negotiate commercially acceptable agreements with the third party vendors in this supply chain  or that labcorp will be able to enter into such agreements at all 
there also can be no assurance that existing effipure inventory levels will be sufficient to support the processing of pregen plus tests for the period of time necessary for labcorp to establish the relationships necessary for the manufacture  supply  and assembly of effipure components or that labcorp will not replace effipure in commercial use 
we are currently in the process of transitioning the procurement and supply chain management of effipure to labcorp 
if labcorp replaces the effipure technology in commercial use with new or improved technologies  our existing effipure inventories could become obsolete  which could require the write off of the then current value of the effipure inventory and approximately million in intellectual property related specifically to effipure 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of actions taken in february to focus research and development efforts on improving the sensitivity and other performance aspects of our technologies and associated cost reductions 
as described under the heading restructuring below  we discontinued certain research efforts and reduced our workforce by ten employees  principally in the research and development functions 
included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were decreases of million in personnel related expenses  million in laboratory expenses  million related to laboratory space and million in clinical study expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in external marketing and promotional expenses partially offset by an increase of million in sales personnel and related costs as a result of the expansion of our sales force to conduct certain sales initiatives and to complement the direct sales efforts of labcorp 
we recently decided to focus the entirety of our sales and marketing efforts primarily on the following constituents thought leaders and third party payors  including self insured employers  managed care organizations  and the technology assessment groups within these organizations 
we began with twenty four sales and marketing employees and ended with seventeen employees in the sales and marketing functions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of million resulting from lower legal  consulting and audit fees as well as a decrease of million in severance costs recorded in the year ended december  in connection with the departure of certain executives 
there was also a decrease in personnel related expenses of million in the year ended december  as compared to restructuring 
in february  we took steps to focus our research and development efforts primarily on improving the sensitivity and other performance aspects of our technology and reduced our cost structure accordingly 
we discontinued certain research efforts  reduced our workforce by ten employees  principally in the research and development functions  and amended the lease for our corporate headquarters in marlborough  ma to reduce the total space leased at the facility from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we accrued charges of million in the quarter ended march  as of june  all liabilities related to the restructuring had been paid 
the table below summarizes the restructuring activities during the year ended december  amounts included in the table are in thousands 
balance  balance  december  cash non cash december  type of liability charges payments write downs employee separation costs facility consolidation costs total employee separation costs in the table above relate to severance packages and out placement services for employees affected by the restructuring 
our decision to reduce the total space leased and abandon the related leasehold improvements was deemed to be an impairment indicator under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result of performing the impairment evaluations  asset impairment charges of million included opposite the caption facility consolidation costs in the table above were recorded to adjust the carrying value of the related leasehold improvements to their net realizable value 
facility consolidation costs also include one time real estate transaction fees in connection with the lease amendment to reduce the space occupied at our corporate headquarters 
our employee headcount decreased from employees at december  to employees at december  in addition to the workforce reduction in connection with our restructuring discussed above  we reduced our headcount on an involuntary basis by an additional three employees during the remainder of our headcount was further reduced during by nine employees as a result of normal attrition 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense  was million for the years ended december  and stock based compensation for the year ended december  included million related to common stock awards and stock options granted to non employees  which are recorded at fair value based on the fair value measurement criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  million recorded in connection with our k plan employer match  which was made in common stock see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k and million related to the amortization of the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering 
stock based compensation for the year ended december  included million related to the amortization of the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering and million related to common stock awards and stock options granted to non employees 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in interest rates on investments held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   partially offset by lower average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the license period 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the amortization of the second million up front license fee received upon the commercial launch of pregen plus in august as well as an increase in revenues related to sales of effipure components to labcorp 
cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the cost of product revenue includes the costs of effipure components while the cost of product royalty revenue represents royalties owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
the increase in the cost of product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of an increase in the number of effipure components shipped to labcorp 
in addition  we recorded charges of approximately million during to write off excess and expired effipure inventory units 
we have contractual commitments to certain of our effipure contract manufacturers which require us to pay minimum aggregate dollar amounts over the life of the commitments  which expire in april a portion of the charges to write off excess and expired effipure inventory units was based upon payments related to these minimum purchase commitments 
as we fulfill these minimum purchase commitments  we may need to make additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory 
for the year ended december   product cost of sales primarily represented the cost of performing commercial colorectal screening tests at our facilities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the completion of our multi center study in the fourth quarter of and the completion of certain other research and development initiatives in to support of the commercialization of pregen plus 
included in the decrease in research and development expenses were decreases of million in laboratory expenses  million in personnel related expenses  million in clinical study expenses and million in professional fees 
also included in the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was a decrease of million in laboratory space costs as a result of the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements recorded in associated with our former facility 
the decreases noted above were partially offset by an increase of million in severance costs associated with the termination of certain officers and employees during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information on employee terminations 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the completion of programs related to the premarketing of pregen plus which ended in resulting in lower professional fees and expenses of million as well as a decrease in facility related expenses of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in million in professional fees  partially offset by a reduction in facility related costs 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  which is a non cash expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation was primarily due to the accelerated method of amortization being utilized to amortize the deferred compensation recorded in connection with options granted prior to our initial public offering 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we recorded million of stock based compensation associated with our agreement to forgive an outstanding loan of a former executive officer  which was offset by a reduction of million in stock based compensation associated with the forfeitures of restricted stock and the cancellation of unvested stock options due to the departure of certain officers and employees 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during as compared to as a result of the completion of our public offering of million shares of common stock in february  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  public offerings of common stock in february and february and cash received from labcorp in connection with our strategic alliance 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  of which approximately million has been pledged as collateral for an outstanding letter of credit 
all of our investments in marketable securities are comprised of fixed income investments and all are deemed available for sale 
the objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared the year ended december  was primarily due to a reduction in our net loss driven by decreases in applied research and administrative expenses 
actions taken during to reduce our cash burn included reducing our workforce see the topic restructuring under results of operations above and focusing our research efforts on improving the performance aspects of our technology through smaller  less expensive studies leveraging results of our prior studies  including our large scale multi center study 
excluding the impact of the upfront deferred licensing fees from labcorp  net cash used in operating activities would have been million for the year ended december  on that basis  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in our operating loss  which was the result of lower research and development spending due to the completion of our  patient multi center study in late  partially offset by approximately million in severance costs associated with the termination of certain employees and officers during cash flows from operations can vary significantly due to various factors  including changes in prepaid expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in and net cash provided investing activities of million in excluding the impact of purchases and maturities of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment of million during the year ended december  were materially consistent with purchases of property and equipment of million during the year ended december  we expect that purchases of property and equipment during will be substantially consistent with amounts spent in purchases of property and equipment of million during were significantly lower than purchases of property and equipment of million in investment in property and equipment in was related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and lab operations to marlborough  massachusetts 
we continued to invest in our patent portfolio for the years ended december  and and we expect that investments made in our patent portfolio in will be substantially consistent with amounts invested in patent costs  which have historically consisted of related legal fees  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued in the united states over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  or upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or when the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and represented proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was primarily due to the offering of million shares of our common stock in february  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million  as well as million in repayment of notes receivable and million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and included million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we expect that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments currently on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next two years  based upon our existing levels of sales and operating expenses 
we do not expect that product royalty fee payments and milestone payments from labcorp will materially supplement our liquidity position in the next twelve months given that stool based dna screening is not yet included within colorectal cancer screening guidelines and only a limited number of payors have issued formal policy approving payment for stool based dna screening under limited conditions 
moreover  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms have not approved stool based dna colorectal cancer screening for payment  have not yet accepted our request for a national coverage determination ncd and have sought additional information regarding the fda regulatory status of pregen plus  which has delayed our application s acceptance 
since commercial launch of pregen plus in august  labcorp has offered the pregen plus testing service as an in house developed laboratory test  or homebrew  a category of tests that has historically been treated as exempt from fda premarket clearance or approval requirements 
in light of recent communications between labcorp and the fda  however  the fda has indicated that a premarket submission is necessary for pregen plus as a medical device 
on january   the fda sent correspondence to labcorp that focused primarily on effipure  but also more broadly on the pregen plus test as a whole and indicated that pregen plus is subject to fda regulation as a medical device and cannot be commercially distributed without an appropriate premarket determination from the fda 
labcorp is currently discussing this matter with the fda with the goal of arriving at a regulatory and commercial solution that is acceptable to both the fda and labcorp 
in connection with the fda s ongoing discussions with labcorp  commercial sales of pregen plus could be delayed  halted or prevented and enforcement action could be initiated which could involve criminal or civil penalties 
in addition  the fda s position on this could negatively affect our operations either through regulation or new enforcement initiatives directed at labcorp or exact or through the required investment by exact of substantial funds to pursue new clinical studies that may be required in connection with an fda premarket submission 
further  the fda may not approve of certain sales and marketing initiatives of exact  which could negatively affect our ability to build awareness around stool based dna testing 
although  milestone and other performance based payments from labcorp for which we may be eligible under our strategic agreement may supplement our liquidity position  the timing and receipt of milestone and performance based payments is unpredictable at this time 
of the remaining million of payments for which we may be eligible under our amended agreement with labcorp  million relates to milestone payments associated with the inclusion of stool based dna testing for colorectal cancer into certain clinical guideline acceptance and policy level reimbursement approvals that  in large part  depend upon decisions to be made by third parties  and million relates to the achievement of certain significant cumulative labcorp revenue thresholds that depend upon labcorp s widespread success with respect to its sales of pregen plus and are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all 
as such  no assurance can be given that any payments pursuant to our agreement with labcorp will be sufficient or timely enough to meet our liquidity needs 
if revenue and other payments from labcorp are insufficient to meet our liquidity needs  or if we determine that our sales  marketing or research and development expenses must increase to achieve our goals  we will be required to raise additional capital or reduce the scale of our operations  or both 
our shelf registration statement on form s filed with the sec was declared effective on september  and permitted us to offer  from time to time  any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase each of the foregoing up to an aggregate of million 
on february   we completed an offering of million shares of common stock under this shelf registration statement which generated net proceeds of million 
as of the date of filing this report on form k  we no longer meet the minimum market capitalization requirement necessary to utilize our shelf registration statement 
while we may  from time to time  seek to access the capital markets  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any future capital raising efforts  or that we would be able to raise additional funds at an acceptable price level 
the table below reflects our estimated fixed obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than more than total one year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations obligations under license and collaborative agreements total operating leases reflect remaining obligations associated with leased facilities in marlborough and maynard  massachusetts 
purchase obligations primarily represent purchase commitments associated with the manufacture and production of effipure 
obligations under license and collaboration agreements represent on going commitments under various research collaborations and licensing agreements 
commitments under license agreements generally expire concurrent with the expiration of the intellectual property licensed from the third party

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments or obtain financing when needed or desirable
