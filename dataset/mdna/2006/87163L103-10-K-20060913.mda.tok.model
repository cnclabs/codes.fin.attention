this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a leading designer  developer  and distributor of high definition televisions  or hdtvs  in liquid crystal display  or lcd  and liquid crystal on silicon  or lcos  formats 
our lcd and our popular priced lcos hdtvs  under our olevia brand name  and our premium large screen  rear projection hdtvs  utilizing our proprietary lcos microdisplay technology  are sold to high end audio video manufacturers  distributors of high end consumer electronics products  and consumer electronics retailers 
our price conscious olevia product lines include flat panel 
table of contents lcd models in diagonal sizes from inches to inches and our inch gen ii lcos rear projection hdtv designed for the high volume home entertainment market  our price performance  full feature olevia product line includes inch and inch high end hdtvs for the home entertainment and home theater markets  and our gen ii lcos rear projection inch hdtv addresses the premium audio video market 
we have established a virtual manufacturing model utilizing asian sourced components and third party contract manufacturers and assemblers located in close proximity to our customers to assemble our hdtvs 
we also offer a broad line of lcos microdisplay products and subsystems  including lcos imagers  that original equipment manufacturers  or oems  can integrate into proprietary hdtv products  home theater projectors  and near to eye applications  such as head mounted monocular or binocular headsets and viewers  for industrial  medical  military  commercial  and consumer applications 
net sales 
our sales result primarily from the sale of lcd and lcos hdtvs 
we also sell microdisplays for near to eye and projection devices to oem customers 
cost of sales 
our gross margins for our lcd and lcos products are influenced by various factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  yields  and absorption issues  product mix  product differentiation  product uniqueness  inventory management  and volume pricing 
to date  our manufacturing capacity for lcos imagers has exceeded our manufacturing volume  resulting in the inability to fully absorb the cost of our manufacturing infrastructure 
lcos imager margins will not improve until we run higher volumes 
selling  distribution  and marketing expense 
selling  distribution  and marketing expense consists of salaries  commissions  and benefits to sales and marketing personnel  co op advertising allowances to our customers  advertising  warehouse costs  and shipping costs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to administrative personnel  insurance expense  legal fees  audit and accounting fees  and facilities costs 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists principally of salaries and benefits to scientists  engineers  and other technical personnel  related facilities costs  process development costs  and various expenses for projects  including new product development 
research and development expense continues to be very high as we continue to develop our lcos technology and manufacturing processes  and refine our hdtv products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
during preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales allowances  bad debts  inventories  investments  fixed assets  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of a sale exists  that is  a product is shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title has passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
sales allowances are estimated based upon historical experience of sales returns 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings  including price markdowns  promotions  other volume based incentives  and expected returns 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an 
table of contents incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
additionally  certain incentive programs require us to estimate  based on industry experience  the number of customers that will actually redeem the incentive 
we also record estimated reductions to revenue for end user rebate programs  returns  and costs related to warranty services in excess of reimbursements from our principal manufacturer 
we have limited operating history upon which to base the estimates for the customer and distributor programs discussed above 
additionally  over the past two fiscal years  there have been significant changes in our distribution channels  product mix  market recognition of our olevia brand  and rapid price declines 
as a result of these rapidly changing factors  the costs of such programs have fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis as a percentage of gross revenue from to 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition  credit history  and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances could be required 
we write down inventories for estimated obsolescence to estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we receive two types of vendor allowances volume rebates  which are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels  and price protection  which is earned based upon the impact of market prices on a monthly basis 
we also obtain incentives for technical assistance and market development that are earned as a result of monthly purchase levels 
all vendor allowances are accrued as earned  and those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels are accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases 
we record the cash consideration received from a vendor in accordance with eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which states that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and is recorded as a reduction of the cost of sales when recognized in our statement of operations 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount 
on july   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires the company to recognize expense related to the estimated fair value of stock based compensation awards 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended june  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfaf 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards granted subsequent to july   was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
stock options are granted to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our stock at the dates of grant 
we recognize the stock based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service periods  which is generally the option vesting term of twelve to fifty months 
all stock options have a term of years 
stock based compensation expense for the year ended june  was million 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss carry forwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized  a valuation allowance is established if necessary 

table of contents we typically warrant our products against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year from purchase with on site service provided for certain of our products 
as of june   we had entered into an agreement with kolin for reimbursement of the cost of our warranty expenses for units sold 
we recognize those reimbursements from kolin first as a reduction to the third party warranty costs  with the excess reimbursement amortized over a month period and applied as a credit to cost of sales for units which have shipped to customers 
we record reimbursements received from kolin for units that have not been shipped to customers as deferred warranty revenue 
we account for our investments in which we have less than a ownership interest at cost and periodically review such investments for impairment 
we account for our investments in which we have a greater than but less than ownership interest and for which we do not have the ability to exercise control under the equity method 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in our financial statements 
years ended june  net sales costs and expenses cost of sales selling  distribution  and marketing general and administrative research and development total costs and expenses operating income loss income loss before income taxes year ended june  compared with year ended june  net sales 
net sales were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal net sales in fiscal consisted of lcd television sales of million and lcos sales of million 
all sales in fiscal were lcd television sales 
the increase in lcd television revenue was a result of increased unit shipments 
during the fiscal year ended june   we shipped approximately  units compared with  in fiscal the merger with syntax groups corporation  which we refer to as the merger  was completed on november  and  therefore  the lcos revenue was only included from december  onward 
average selling prices for lcd televisions decreased to per unit in fiscal from per unit in fiscal the weighted average screen size of units sold in fiscal increased to inches from inches in fiscal the average selling price per diagonal inch of screen size decreased to per inch in fiscal from per inch in fiscal cost of sales 
total cost of sales was million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal cost of lcd television sales was million  or of lcd television sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of lcd television sales  in fiscal the increase in lcd television gross margins was a result of higher selling volumes and increased brand awareness and dramatic cost reductions in the 
table of contents components used to assemble lcd televisions  including lcd panels 
cost of sales per unit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of sales per diagonal inch of screen size decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of sales for the fiscal years ended june  and includes purchases from kolin  net of rebates  totaling million and million  respectively 
cost of lcos net sales was million  or of lcos sales  in fiscal cost of lcos net sales was included from december  onward as the merger closed on november  there were no lcos sales in fiscal the large negative gross margin in the period resulted primarily from the low volume of shipments and low manufacturing yields in the shipped products 
to date  our manufacturing capacity has exceeded our manufacturing volume  resulting in the inability to absorb fully the cost of our manufacturing infrastructure 
a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed in nature and consist of items  such as utilities  depreciation  and amortization 
the amounts of these costs do not vary period to period based on the number of units produced nor can the amounts of these costs be adjusted in the short term 
therefore  in periods of lower production volume  these fixed costs are absorbed by a lower number of units  thus increasing the cost per unit 
as a result  we expect it will be difficult to attain significant improvements in gross margins until we can operate at higher production volumes 
on march   in conjunction with our plans to expand our product lines to include home entertainment products  including lcd televisions  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with kolin 
this manufacturing agreement had an initial term of one year and could be extended for up to five additional one year periods at our option 
we have elected to extend this manufacturing agreement for one additional year to march in conjunction with the execution of this manufacturing agreement  we also entered into an additional agreement intended to govern the terms pursuant to which we  kolin  and digimedia technology co  ltd  or digimedia  the product research and development subsidiary of kolin  would form a strategic alliance through the acquisition by kolin of up to of our common stock and the acquisition by us of up to of the common stock of digimedia 
on march   we sold kolin million shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of million 
as of march   kolin and one of its subsidiaries had purchased a total of million shares of our common stock  representing approximately of our outstanding stock 
as a result of the foregoing  kolin and digimedia are considered related parties 
in march  we entered into three additional agreements with kolin that provide for rebates to us on purchases from kolin 
under these agreements  we receive a rebate equal to of purchases for providing technical know how to kolin  for market development funds  and volume incentive rebates up to of purchases 
these rebates are issued monthly based upon units shipped from kolin to us 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  we record these rebates as a reduction to the price of the products purchased upon receipt of the products and allocate such rebates to inventory and cost of sales accordingly 
rebates granted by kolin applicable to goods in transit are recorded as amounts outstanding to kolin until such goods are received 
on september   we entered into a five year exclusive distribution agreement with kolin  which grants us the exclusive right to market and distribute products under the kolin brand throughout north america 
for the years ended june  and  kolin agreed to grant us rebates for price protection of million and million  representing and of actual purchases from kolin  respectively  which were credited to cost of sales in the period received as these price protection grants related to inventory purchased from kolin that had been sold to our customers during the respective periods 
as of june   the amount of the reduction in the value of inventory purchased from kolin and the corresponding reduction in the accounts payable balance due to kolin was million 
as of june   we had entered into an agreement with kolin for reimbursement of warranty costs for units we sold 
through december  we had retained an independent third party to provide on site service to consumers that purchase our lcd television products 
the cost to us for this service was per unit shipped 
since january  we have provided on site service to consumers for warranty claims through a different third party  which is billed to us on a case by case basis 
kolin has agreed to reimburse us varying amounts ranging from to per unit to cover the cost of these warranty expenses as well as our costs in administering the program and servicing units that cannot be serviced by the warranty providers 
kolin provides these per unit reimbursements at 
table of contents the time they ship products to us 
we record these reimbursements from kolin first as a reduction to the third party warranty costs  with the excess reimbursement amortized over a month period and applied as a credit to cost of sales for units which have shipped to customers 
we record reimbursements received from kolin for units which have not been shipped to customers as deferred warranty revenue 
as of june   deferred warranty revenue was million 
recognized warranty reimbursements  which are recorded as a reduction in cost of sales  totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
between may and september  we purchased tuners and av module components used in the assembly of lcd tv products from the riking group  a hong kong based exporter and a related party 
for the fiscal year ended june   purchases from riking totaled  selling  distribution  and marketing expense 
selling  distribution  and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales  in the fiscal year ended june  compared with million  or of net sales  in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in selling  distribution  and marketing expenses for the year was primarily related to increased advertising expenses and other marketing costs necessary to develop our distribution channel and additional personnel costs resulting from the merger 
advertising expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense totaled million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase was a result of additional personnel costs resulting from the merger  recognition of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r  and increased costs associated with being a public company  including directors and officers insurance and legal and accounting fees 
research and development expense 
research and development expense totaled million in fiscal research and development expense began to be incurred upon completion of the merger on november  there was no such expense in the previous year 
interest expense 
in fiscal  we recorded net interest expense of million compared with  in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred interest expense related to our credit facility with preferred bank totaling approximately million  cash interest expense related to our senior secured debentures of approximately  and non cash interest expense and amortization of issuance costs related to the convertible debentures  senior secured debentures  and redeemable convertible preferred stock of approximately million 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to measure the value of the warrants issued with debentures and redeemable convertible preferred stock issued and the beneficial conversion feature of the convertible debentures and redeemable convertible preferred stock issued 
the resulting values were recorded as a discount to the debentures and redeemable convertible preferred stock with a corresponding increase in additional paid in capital 
the original discount to the convertible debentures was equal to their face value of million and the original discount to the secured debentures was million 
the original discount and beneficial conversion feature to the redeemable convertible preferred stock was million 
the discount  along with amortization of issuance costs  is being accreted to interest expense over the three year term of the notes and the two year term of the redeemable convertible preferred stock 
income taxes 
fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset  including our past and projected operating results  the character and jurisdiction of such operating results  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
since completion of the merger on november   we have not reached profitability 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance of approximately million against the deferred tax assets as of june  when it becomes more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will reduce the valuation allowance and begin to recognize the deferred tax asset as a tax benefit in our statement of operations 

table of contents there were approximately million and million of federal and state net operating loss carryovers respectively as of june  the usage of these losses may be subject to an annual section limitation since brillian corporation went through an ownership change as a result of the merger with syntax groups corporation

in april  we entered into an agreement whereby kolin agreed that in no event will the amount of the price protection to be issued by kolin to us for any calendar month be less than of the amount invoiced by us to our customers for such calendar month 
accordingly  we record an reduction in the value of inventory purchased from kolin and a corresponding reduction in the accounts payable balance due to kolin to reflect the impact of this guaranteed price protection on our balance sheet

we incurred operating losses from our inception until the year ended june   when we recorded income from operations of  on november   we completed the merger with brillian corporation with syntax groups corporation 
in the fiscal year ended june   which included seven months of the operations conducted by brillian  we incurred an operating loss of million 
we have historically funded our operating cash outflows through the use of notes payable and bank lines of credit with a borrowing base calculated as a percentage of eligible accounts receivable as explained below  and through the issuance of long term debt  preferred stock  and common stock

we believe that the cash from the redeemable convertible preferred stock issuance in december  the cash from the common stock issuance in march  and the increased preferred bank credit facility will be sufficient to sustain operations at the current level for the next months 
however  if we continue to experience rapid revenue growth  additional capacity under accounts receivable lines of credit or other sources of financing  such as long term debt or equity financing  will be necessary 
we are currently negotiating a larger working capital credit facility that  if consummated  we believe would be sufficient to finance anticipated growth for the next months 
although there can be no assurance that the required financing will be available on favorable terms  or at all  we 
table of contents believe that we will be able to obtain the required financing to continue to fund our business  including the anticipated growth  for at least the next months 
if sufficient additional financing is not available  we would need to curtail our growth rate in order to have sufficient cash to continue our operations
