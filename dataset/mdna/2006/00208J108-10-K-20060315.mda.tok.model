index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview general atp oil gas corporation is engaged in the acquisition  development and production of oil and natural gas properties in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we seek to acquire and develop properties with proved undeveloped reserves pud that are economically attractive to us but are not strategic to major or large exploration oriented independent oil and gas companies 
occasionally we will acquire properties that are already producing or where previous drilling has encountered reservoirs that appear to us to contain commercially productive quantities of oil and gas even though the reservoirs do not meet the sec definition of proved reserves 
we believe that our strategy provides assets for us to develop and produce without the risk  cost or time of traditional exploration 
we seek to create value and reduce operating risks through the acquisition and development of proved oil and natural gas reserves in areas that have significant undeveloped reserves and reservoirs  close proximity to developed markets for oil and natural gas  existing infrastructure of oil and natural gas pipelines and production processing platforms  and a relatively stable regulatory environment for offshore oil and natural gas development and production 
our focus is on acquiring properties that have become non core or non strategic to their original owners for a variety of reasons 
for example  larger oil companies from time to time adjust their capital spending or shift their focus to exploration prospects which they believe offer greater reserve potential 
some projects provide lower economic returns to a company due to its cost structure within that company 
also  due to timing or budget constraints  a company may be unwilling or unable to develop a property before the expiration of the lease 
because of our cost structure  expertise in our areas of focus and ability to develop projects  the properties may be more financially attractive to us than the seller 
given our strategy of acquiring properties that contain proved reserves  our operations typically are lower risk than exploration focused gulf of mexico and north sea operators 
we focus on developing projects in the shortest time possible between initial significant investment and first revenue generated in order to maximize our rate of return 
since we operate a significant number of the properties in which we acquire a working interest  we are able to significantly influence the development concept and timing of a project s development 
we typically initiate new development projects by simultaneously obtaining the various required components such as the pipeline and the production platform or subsea well completion equipment 
we believe this strategy  combined with our strong technical abilities to evaluate and implement a project s requirements  allows us to efficiently complete the development project and commence production 
to enhance the economics and return on investment of a project  we sometimes develop the project to a value creation point and either sell an interest or bring in partners on a promoted basis during the high capital development phase 
in  we sold interests in three projects in the gulf of mexico on a promoted basis to reduce the amount of capital employed 
we continued this practice into whereupon we sold of our interest in seven projects containing ten offshore blocks in the gulf of mexico for million  approximately mcfe for proved reserves  of which were proved undeveloped reserves 
in we sold a interest on a promoted basis in our tors project in the uk sector of the north sea after the field development plan was obtained 
review of the year was a year of major growth in proved reserves and significant progress towards a step change in production rates for atp 
the growth in reserves was accomplished through acquisitions during a period of historically high oil and gas prices and the recording of proved reserves at cheviot in the north sea 
the significant progress in achieving a step change in production rates occurred in spite of one of the most catastrophic hurricane seasons ever experienced in the gulf of mexico 
we also amended our term loan and added additional liquidity of million  reduced our leverage by completing a million preferred equity offering and added a capital lease for a portion of the development at gomez in the gulf of mexico

index to financial statements the hurricane season of resulted in significant delays in our development activities and resulted in production losses in at many of our producing properties 
most of the physical damage to our assets was covered by our insurance 
at december  we recorded a receivable for approximately million net of million in deductibles for hurricanes katrina and rita for our expected insurance recovery of damage assessment costs and repairs which were made during in  we expect to incur additional insured repair and recovery costs related to these storms of less than million 
in addition the company expects to recover amounts under our loss of production insurance policy  however due to the uncertainty of the ultimate amount no receivable has been recorded for that expected recovery 
reserves at december   we had proved reserves of bcfe  of which are located in the north sea and the remaining are in the gulf of mexico 
the pre tax pv of our proved reserves at december  was billion 
see item properties oil and natural gas reserves for reconciliation to after tax pv in addition  we have scheduled for drilling or completion  properties where previous drilling into the targeted reservoirs indicates to the company the presence of commercially productive quantities of hydrocarbons even though the reservoirs do not meet the sec definition of proved reserves 
upon completion of drilling  completion or testing of wells on these blocks and similar properties in the company s portfolio  the company anticipates that it may be able to record proved reserves associated with several of these properties 
acquisitions gulf of mexico atp was active in both of the minerals management service sponsored offshore lease sales during in addition  atp closed three transactions for the purchase of minerals in place during these purchases  which total million in acquisition costs  resulted in recording bcfe of proved reserves  of which were classified as proved developed 
western gulf of mexico offshore lease sale atp acquired three blocks for million at the western gulf of mexico offshore lease sale held on august  the blocks are located in approximately to feet of water 
all three of the blocks have been previously drilled and the related logs indicate the presence of hydrocarbons 
one of the blocks  high island a  which was awarded to atp in december  has already been added to atp s development program 
atp holds a working interest and serves as operator of each of the blocks 
central gulf of mexico offshore lease sale atp acquired seven blocks for million at the central gulf of mexico offshore lease sale held march  two of the blocks are adjacent to the company s wholly owned mississippi canyon development 
two additional blocks are contiguous to an existing atp operated development in the west cameron area and the remaining three blocks provide access to new development area opportunities 
the blocks are located in approximately to  feet of water 
atp owns a working interest and serves as operator of each property 
south marsh island during the second quarter  atp acquired south marsh island we reentered and completed a temporarily abandoned well which had previously encountered hydrocarbons 
as a result of this development work  proved developed reserves were recorded for this property at year end atp holds a working interest in and operates south marsh island king s peak atp acquired a working interest in the producing property king s peak in late september atp operates this property located on mississippi canyon blocks and and desoto canyon blocks and king s peak contains an estimated bcfe of proved reserves 
in addition  the property contains additional development potential from unproved drilling locations

north sea tors atp increased its net working interest ownership to in the tors fields  garrow and kilmar  through two separate transactions 
first  atp oil gas uk limited  a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired a working interest ownership from its partner in the second quarter  and then sold a working interest ownership to a new partner in the fourth quarter this purchase and sale allowed atp to reduce its capital exposure and lower its development cost per mcfe  with the net result of improving the overall return for the project and our shareholders

financings the progress we made in moving our projects closer to commercial production  despite a difficult hurricane season  was supported by three financings 
during the second quarter  we amended and improved the terms of our senior secured credit facility by expanding it to million  reducing the interest rate  and extending the maturity to april net of transaction costs  this amendment added million in additional liquidity 
during the third quarter  we issued million of non convertible perpetual preferred stock  which raised net proceeds of million

at december  the balance is reflected as a long term liability of million in the financial statements 
the property was developed during and commenced production in february we expect to reclass this liability as a reduction to oil and gas properties in the first quarter of since our obligation under the agreement has now been fulfilled 
our liabilities also include asset retirement obligations million current and million long term that represent the estimated fair value at december  of our obligations with respect to the retirement plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas properties 
each reporting period the liability is accreted to its then present value 
the ultimate settlement amount and the timing of the settlement of such obligations is unknown because they are subject to  among other things  federal  state and local regulation and economic factors

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
such estimates and judgments are evaluated and modified as necessary on an ongoing basis 
significant estimates include dd a of proved oil and gas properties 
oil and gas reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production dd a and the impairment analysis  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies discussed below and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our company 
oil and gas property accounting we account for our oil and gas property costs using the successful efforts accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling and development costs on successful wells and development dry holes are capitalized 
costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when a well is determined to be unsuccessful 
capitalized costs relating to producing properties are depleted on the units of production method 
proved developed reserves are used in computing unit rates for drilling and development costs and total proved reserves for depletion rates of leasehold  platform and pipeline costs 
estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs and estimated residual salvage values are taken into account in determining amortization and depletion provisions 
expenditures for geological and geophysical testing costs are generally charged to expense unless the costs can be specifically attributed to mapping a proved reservoir and determining the optimal placement for future developmental well locations 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
the costs and related accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposition are reflected in the statements of operations 
costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization base until the related properties are developed 
unproved properties are periodically assessed and any impairment in value is charged to impairment expense 
the costs of unproved properties are transferred to proved oil and gas properties upon meeting sec requirements and amortized on a unit of production 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
this method requires us to amortize the capitalized costs incurred in developing a property in proportion to the amount of oil and gas produced as a percentage of the amount of proved reserves contained in the property 
accordingly  changes in reserve estimates as described above will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense recognized in periods subsequent to the reserve estimate revision 
most of our gulf of mexico reserves and all of our netherlands reserves quantities are prepared annually by independent petroleum 
table of contents 
index to financial statements engineers ryder scott company  lp the remainder of our gulf of mexico reserves related to newly acquired properties were prepared by degolyer and macnaughton and collarini associates 
our uk sector north sea reserves are prepared annually by independent petroleum consultants rps energy formerly rps troy ikoda 
see the supplemental information unaudited in our consolidated financial statements for reserve data related to our properties 
impairment analysis we perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions and actual or planned drilling or other development activities 
for a property determined to be impaired  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired property will be recognized 
fair value  on a depletable unit basis  is estimated to be the present value of the aforementioned expected future net cash flows 
an impairment allowance is provided on an unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations related to the plugging and abandonment of our oil and gas wells  dismantling our offshore production platforms  and the removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and returning such land to its original condition 
sfas requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities in preparing financial statements at any point in time  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions from time to time  which if determined adversely  could have a material negative impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management  with the assistance of counsel makes estimates  if determinable  of atp s probable liabilities and records such amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates may be the minimum amount of a range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
disclosure is made  when determinable  of any additional possible amount of loss on these claims  or if such estimate cannot be made  that fact is disclosed 
along with our counsel  we monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  we make adjustments to recorded liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  management is not aware of any amounts that need to be recorded and believes that the recorded amounts  if any  are reasonable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements price risk management activities we periodically enter into commodity derivative contracts and fixed price physical contracts to manage our exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
we primarily utilize fixed price physical contracts  price swaps and put options  which are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counterparties of high credit quality that we believe are minimal credit risks 
the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts are based upon oil and natural gas  which have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices we receive 
under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all derivative instruments  unless designated as normal purchases and sales  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded in oil and natural gas revenues 
as of december   we had three derivative contracts in place that qualified as cash flow hedges and fourteen gas and oil fixed price futures contracts designated as normal sales contracts 
valuation of deferred tax asset we compute income taxes in accordance with sfas the standard requires an asset and liability approach which results in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of those assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires the recording of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we have incurred net operating losses in and prior years 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that cumulative losses in recent years constitute significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about income are overshadowed by such history of losses 
delays in bringing properties on to production and development cost overruns in were also significant factors considered in evaluating our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance of million as of december  we achieved profitable operations in  however the income generated in was not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence noted in the prior years 
during  we incurred a net loss before income taxes of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under the term loan 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk 
the net assets  net earnings and cash flows from our wholly owned subsidiaries in the uk and the netherlands are based on the uk dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the applicable functional currency 
these foreign operations have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency in the us dollar 
we have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our term loan is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
we currently sell a portion of our oil and natural gas production under price sensitive or market price contracts 
we periodically use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk 
we hedge a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we may use futures contracts  swaps  put options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge our commodity prices 
realized gains and losses from our price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas sales when the associated production occurs 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the unrecognized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
our internal hedging policy provides that we examine the economic effect of entering into a commodity contract with respect to the properties that we acquire 
we generally acquire properties at prices that are below the management s estimated value of the estimated proved reserves at the then current oil and natural gas prices 
we may enter into short term hedging arrangements if we are able to obtain commodity contracts at prices sufficient to secure an acceptable internal rate of return on a particular property or on a group of properties or if deemed necessary by the terms of our existing credit agreements
