item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of our results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information under item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and  as such  are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
the reader should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements for many reasons including those risks discussed under part i 
item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  accrued expenses and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  market trends  financial forecasts and projections and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and apply them on a consistent basis 
we believe that consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent our financial condition  operating results and cash flows for all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or errors in these estimates and judgments may have a material impact on our financial conditions  operating results and cash flows 
deferred revenues 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period we are required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
recognition of revenue 
revenue from product sales to direct customers is recognized upon shipment as we generally do not have any post shipment obligations or allow for any acceptance provisions 
in the event a situation occurs to create a post shipment obligation  we would defer revenue recognition until the specific obligation was satisfied 
we defer recognition of sales to distributors when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of product returns due to insufficient historical product return information 
he revenue recorded is dependent upon estimates of expected customer returns and sales discounts 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period we are required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
revenue from research and development activities that are funded by customers is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from royalties is recognized upon the notification to us of shipment of product from our technology license partners to direct customers 
page inventory valuation 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we seek to maintain a stringent credit approval process although our management must make significant judgments in assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
or all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
we continue to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 
deferred income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes on a consolidated basis 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon us generating sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
long lived assets 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under current standards  the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
there can be no assurance that future long lived asset impairments will not occur 
page goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december   and determined that no impairment existed at that date 
this assessment requires estimates of future revenue  operating results and cash flows  as well as estimates of critical valuation inputs such as discount rates  terminal values and similar data 
we continue to perform periodic and annual impairment analyses of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
as a result of such impairment analyses  impairment charges may be recorded and may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results 
additionally  we may make strategic business decisions in future periods which impact the fair value of goodwill  which could result in significant impairment charges 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
inventory valuation adjustments 
our working capital requirements have followed our sales growth 
we must carry significant amounts of inventory to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers 
to do this  we order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
we have in the past produced excess quantities of certain products and this  in combination with the difficulty of predicting future average selling prices  has resulted in us incurring inventory valuation adjustments 
in addition  our distributors have a right to return products under certain conditions  which affects inventory reserves 
we recognize revenue on shipments to distributors at the time of shipment  along with a reserve for estimated returns based on historical data 
results of operations overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets specialized semiconductor memory  microcontroller and integrated semiconductor solutions used in many markets for a wide range of applications 
we pioneered the integration of ferroelectric materials into semiconductor products  which enabled the development of a new class of nonvolatile memory products  called ferroelectric random access memory fram 
fram products merge the advantages of multiple memory technologies into a single device that is able to retain information without a power source  be read from and written to at very fast speeds  written to many times  consumes low amounts of power and simplifies the design of electronic systems 
in many cases we are the sole provider of fram enabled semiconductor products  which facilitates close customer relationships  long application lifecycles and the potential for high margin sales 
we have shipped over million fram products and we are a leader in commercialization of fram semiconductor products 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we outsource all of our semiconductor fabrication  assembly and test functions  which enables us to focus on the design  development  sales and marketing of our fram products and reduce the level of our capital investments 
page in  we completed initiatives to facilitate the acceleration of the growth of our fram and integrated semiconductor product lines 
in july  we divested our mushkin inc subsidiary  for million 
accordingly  we have revised our and financial statements to reflect mushkin inc as a discontinued operation 
in august  we acquired montreal  canada based goal semiconductor inc for approximately million in cash and million shares of our common stock 
we believe this acquisition will enable us to design and develop mixed signal integrated circuits for the embedded data acquisition market and accelerate our product development strategy and provide our customers with an expanded portfolio products 
we began development of several new stand alone products in for introduction in  including a kilobit fram memory device 
we are also qualifying more of our existing products to the aec q automotive quality standard  and we continue to work on the megabit fram as well as a new fram serial memory design at texas instruments 
during  we plan to expand our current line of microcontroller product offerings with two introductions  including new high performance versa derivatives 
in our integrated product category  we plan to introduce four products in  including new processor companions and our much anticipated versa and versa mix microcontrollers with integrated fram data memory 
our total revenue for the year ended december  was million 
in  of our revenue was derived from sales of our fram products for applications in our target markets  which include metering  computing and information systems  automotive  communications  consumer  and industrial  scientific and medical 
we use a direct sales force and a global network of distributors to sell our semiconductor products 
in many cases  our distributors are responsible for product demand creation through original equipment manufacturer oem customers who are not directly served by our internal regional sales managers 
in  approximately of our product sales were generated through our authorized distributor network  while direct customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
our current plans anticipate that we will be profitable in in addition to our colorado springs  colorado headquarters facility  we maintain full time sales and customer service personnel in canada  japan  europe  hong kong  south korea  and china 
we have distribution and or representation relationships with more than companies worldwide  including north america  europe  japan and asia 
our sales have been balanced across our major sales regions including the americas  europe  asia and japan 
as a result  we are not particularly vulnerable to regional economic fluctuations in a specific part of the world 
for fiscal years  and  international sales comprised approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenue 
page our focus over the past few years has been to grow our non enel  or core fram revenue  to overcome the anticipated wind down of the enel meter installation program by mid enel is a leading utility company in italy and has been a significant ramtron customer for fram products since non enel  or core fram  product revenue for each of the last three years totaled approximately million  million and million in   and  respectively 
in  we replaced about million of the million decline in enel revenue with revenue from other customers  which amounted to a increase in core fram sales 
for  we anticipate that product revenue  excluding sales to enel  will grow between and 
our success in building core fram revenue was fueled by top customers in our most active fram target markets 
among our target markets  metering  computing  and automotive are currently driving our product revenue growth 
product sales within our metering target market continued to dominate in  contributing to our total product revenue 
metering programs are active in every geographical area with europe and china in the forefront 
ampy in the uk continues to be a major customer in metering outside of enel  however  global suppliers in europe and north america continue to increase in volume 
in china  where of our asian business is generated  metering applications are the biggest revenue drivers 
of our business in china is from meter manufacturers by known companies hangzhou holley group  hunan weisheng  shenzhen longdian  and hangzhou hualong 
two of our largest us meter customers continue to win business domestically and abroad with fram based meters  and we expect them to grow in in  of our revenue came from computing applications with multi function printers contributing the lion s share 
ricoh  a global printer and copier maker  continued to be a major customer  along side a variety of laser and inkjet printer machine and accessory manufacturers 
in addition  promise technology was among our top computing customers in using fram in disk drive controllers 
other emerging computing platforms that are considering or using fram include repeaters and gigabit ethernet networking devices 
automotive applications made up about of our product revenue in europe and korea are particularly strong regions for fram automotive applications  although we have programs in japan and north america as well 
auto opportunities that are growing in europe include data recorders  seat sensors  adaptive steering  sliding roof controllers  distance radar  and navigation 
as evidence of our progress in this area  we recently secured million worth of business per year with a prominent automotive instrumentation provider and have quoted five new programs for one of the world s most diverse automotive systems manufacturers 
our products are currently being used in vws  bmws and mercedes benz products 
in korea  we have several programs identified at one of the country s largest auto manufacturers  which include tire pressure monitoring  occupant sensors and satellite radio receivers 
in north america  smart airbags continue to be our primary automotive application 
page additional revenue sources have included customer sponsored research and development programs for fram technology with major semiconductor manufacturers 
historically  we have also derived revenue from the licensing of our fram intellectual property to a number semiconductor manufacturers 
royalties result from the sale of fram products by certain licensees 
customer sponsored research and development program fees are primarily generated as a result of ferroelectric technology support programs with major semiconductor manufacturers 
we expect to see slight increases in royalty payments and continued reductions in customer sponsored research and development revenue in our total costs and expenses increased from to  compared with a increase from to operating expenses are projected to be between million and million for the first quarter of our gross margin in was  compared with for  and for in  the decline in fram gross margin was attributable to lower yields on newly introduced products 
in  fram gross margin improved as manufacturing yields improved  and we realized cost reductions at our subcontract manufacturers 
gross margin for the first quarter of is currently anticipated to be between and 
research and development expenses  including customer sponsored research and development  were million in  compared with million in  and million in these expenses  as a percentage of total sales were in  compared with in  and in general and administrative expenses decreased from million in  to million in  primarily due to management bonuses that were part of the expense and were not earned in these expenses were of total revenue in  in  and in sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in  to million in  primarily due to lower sales commissions and sales bonuses 
these expenses were of total revenue in  in  and in in  we plan to increase spending to fund additional research and development  increase spending in sales and marketing and reduce the percentage of revenue spent for general and administrative functions 
we may establish new foundry partners in the future to ensure broad support of our product plans 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to our total revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  cost of product sales  including provision for inventory write off  as a percentage of product revenue  increased approximately  primarily due to increased page inventory write offs in our costs and expenses were million during the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the resulting loss from continuing operations in was million  compared with income from continuing operations of million in the million decrease in operating results was due  in part  to charges of million related to the retirement of the company s fixed rate convertible debentures  million related to the acquisition of goal semiconductor  and a first quarter inventory write off of revenue from the enel meter installation program decreased as expected in as the program began to wind down 
enel product revenue in was million  compared with million in  and million in in  we made up about million of the million year over year decline in enel revenue  which resulted in a increase in non enel  or core fram sales 
non enel product revenue for each of the last three years totaled approximately million  million and million in   and  respectively 
non product revenue during  which included royalty payments and license revenue  remained flat  compared with customer sponsored research and development revenue decreased million from to due to lower research and development fee payments by texas instruments 
product gross margin contributions were million in  compared with million in the lower margin contributions resulted from decreased sales to enel in and lower product yields on newly introduced products 
combined research and development expenses increased million from to to million 
combined research and development expense were of revenue in  compared with in the increase primarily resulted from increased spending on design related activities 
general and administrative expenses decreased million from to to million 
general and administrative expenses were of revenue in and the primary reason for the decrease was management bonuses were part of the expense and management bonuses were not earned in sales and marketing expenses decreased million from to to million 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue in  compared with in the decrease was a result of reduced sales commissions and bonuses in  offset by increased bad debt expense due to a bankruptcy of a major customer 
interest expense  related party  decreased million from to to million due to the retirement of the infineon convertible debenture in july other interest expense decreased million from to to million in this was due to the retirement of the company s convertible debentures  along with less principal outstanding and less minimum interest charges on our new line of credit 
this was offset by million of interest related to borrowings on our revolving line of credit and term loan with silicon valley bank 
page other income increased million from to to million 
this was due primarily to foreign exchange gains incurred in there were no foreign exchange gains or losses in loss from discontinued operations 
on july   the company announced the divestiture of its mushkin subsidiary for consideration of approximately million 
the consideration provided in the sale included  among other things  mushkin s current accounts receivable and cash balances  which the company retained 
the sale closed on july  the company recognized impairment charges during the second quarter of to goodwill for million  to long lived assets for  and to inventory for  related to the divestiture 
the loss from discontinued operations of million in was primarily mushkin related due to the aforementioned write offs 
during the first quarter of  the company committed to a plan to sell substantially all of the remaining assets of ems 
the remaining assets consisted primarily of ems patent portfolio 
the company completed the sale of ems patent portfolio on april   the proceeds of which were million 
due to a write down of the carrying value of the patent portfolio to its estimated fair value at march   there was no gain or loss recorded on the finalization of the sale 
the income from discontinued operations in was related to a profit from our mushkin subsidiary of million  offset by the loss of million for the impairment loss on ems s patent portfolio 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the consolidated financial statements of ems and mushkin have been recast to present these businesses as discontinued operations 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to our total revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this was a to revenue growth rate of 
overall cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue was in  compared with in our costs and expenses were million during the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in the resulting income from continuing operations in was million  which compares to a loss from continuing operations of million in the million increase in operating results  which lead to our first profitable year  was due to a combination of revenue growth and careful management of research and development  and general and administrative spending 
page product sales contributed an increased dollar amount of gross margin from to product gross margin contributions were million in and million in this resulted from improved gross margin percentages  which were in  compared with in  coupled with increased sales 
the increased sales were a result of the continued expansion of our fram customer base  deeper penetration to understand the current and future needs of our customers  expanding fram product portfolio  and our continued participation in the utility meter replacement program at enel 
enel product revenue in was million  compared with million in our non enel  or core fram product revenue  totaled approximately million and million during and  respectively 
this was a year over year growth rate of 
in non product revenue  from to  we experienced a million increased in royalty revenue and a million increase in license revenue  but these were offset by a million reduction in customer sponsored research and development revenue 
the increased royalty revenue resulted from increased royalty payments from a major fram licensee due to continued growth in its revenue stream 
the increase in the license and development fees resulted from a final installment on a license agreement 
customer sponsored research and development decreased because of a reduction in support provided to texas instruments 
combined research and development expenses increased million from to to million 
combined research and development expense were of revenue in  compared with in general and administrative expenses in increased million over to million 
general and administrative expenses were of revenue in and in the increase in was primarily due to management bonuses earned in sales and marketing expenses increased million from to to million 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenue in  compared with in the increase in resulted primarily from increased incentives relating to performance plans 
income from discontinued operations of million in  compared with an million loss in the difference of million was due to the reduction of ems activities beginning in april  coupled with a goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in at our mushkin subsidiary 
mushkin is now classified as part of discontinued operations 
in  we recorded an impairment to goodwill of million relating to our mushkin subsidiary 
a sustained downturn in dram market conditions resulted in lower than expected actual and projected revenue and profitability of mushkin during the first half of because we believed the downturn would likely continue to cause lower than expected sales and page profitability for some time into the future  we believed it was appropriate to review the fair value of goodwill related to mushkin as of june  the result of our review was a charge of million for impairment of goodwill in the quarter ended june  in calculating the impairment charge  the fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology and market comparisons 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased million from to to million 
operating activities 
we used million cash for operations in  compared with million cash generated for operations in the difference of million is primarily due to a million loss in  offset by non cash charges of million relating to write off of in process research and development associated with our acquisition of goal  amortization of our debt discount  and other non cash charges from the payoff of our convertible debentures 
also effecting our use of cash from operations in was a million increase in inventory including write offs in  compared with an million use of cash during offsetting the above was a million reduction in accounts receivable that generated cash in  compared with a million use of cash in cash used in investing activities was million in  compared with million provided in this change was primarily related to the million purchase of goal semiconductor  inc and increased capital expenditures of million in  compared with in  net cash provided by financing activities was million  compared with a use of cash of million in the million net change from to was due to proceeds from the mortgage and term loans of million in  offset by million increase in debenture payments in due to the payoff of our convertible debentures in page debt instruments 
in september  we entered into a loan agreement with silicon valley bank 
the loan agreement provides for a million secured term loan facility  which replaced our loan agreement with wells fargo 
interest on the term loan is set at a floating rate equal to the prime lending rate plus per year and the term loan has a term of months 
the loan agreement also provides for a million revolving secured credit facility 
interest on the revolving facility is set at a floating rate equal to the prime lending rate plus per year  with a minimum interest rate of per year 
the revolving facility has a term of two years 
as of december   no balance was outstanding on the revolving facility 
security for the loan agreement includes all of our assets except for real estate 
in addition  we entered into an intellectual property security agreement with silicon valley bank that secures our obligations under the loan agreement by granting silicon valley bank a security interest in our intellectual property 
we will be required to comply with certain covenants under the loan agreement  including without limitation  requirements to maintain a minimum net worth and maintain certain leverage ratios  and restrictions on certain actions without the consent of silicon valley bank  such as the disposal and acquisition of its business or property  changes in business  ownership or location of collateral  mergers or acquisitions  investments or transactions with affiliates  and paying subordinated debt or dividends 
in july  we retired our outstanding year  fixed rate  convertible debentures with bramwell capital corporation  alexandra global master fund  ltd 
and infineon  which were due in march we paid a total of approximately million  including the aggregate principal and an aggregate premium payment representing future interest payments  to retire the debt early 
the six year warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at per share that we issued with the debentures remain outstanding 
we took a pre tax charge of approximately million for the third quarter of  of which million was non cash  to account for costs associated with the debt repayment 
the debentures were secured by a deed of trust on our headquarters facility in colorado springs  colorado and by a security interest in certain of our accounts receivable and patents 
we terminated the provisions of the securities purchase agreements and related security agreements concurrently with the debentures  except for certain obligations relating to the six year common stock warrants that we issued to the investors concurrently with the debentures 
on december   the company  through its subsidiary  ramtron llc  for which we serves as sole member and sole manager  closed a mortgage loan facility with american national insurance company 
ramtron llc entered into a promissory note evidencing the loan with the principal amount of  with a maturity date of january   bearing interest at 
ramtron llc also entered into an agreement for the benefit of american national insurance company securing the company s real estate as collateral for the mortgage loan facility 
page on december   the company entered into a loan modification agreement which completed the restructuring of its amended and restated loan agreement with silicon valley bank  a subsidiary of silicon valley bancshares 
the loan modification agreement provides for the waiver of the company s event of default on october   revises the financial covenants to better reflect the company s operations  and includes provision for the company s investment in its canadian subsidiary and payments pursuant to the recent mortgage financing of the company s colorado springs facility 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as december  in the future  the primary source of operating cash flows is expected to be product sales 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe we have sufficient resources to fund our operations through at least if this is not sufficient to meet our cash requirements  we may use the credit facility mentioned above or any other credit facility we may obtain 
in view of our expected future working capital requirements in connection with the design  manufacturing and sale of our products  and our projected expenditures  we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any issuance of common or preferred stock to obtain additional funding would result in dilution of existing stockholders interests in us 
the inability to obtain additional financing when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results and could adversely affect our ability to continue our business operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
at december   our commitments under our contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows in thousands after total long term debt      operating leases  purchase obligations   total      includes required principal and interest payments for outstanding term loan with silicon valley bank  mortgage loan with american national insurance company  the settlement with national semiconductor corporation and minimum interest charges related to our revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank 
page our purchase obligations are amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price  quantity  delivery and termination liability and are the result of purchase orders placed but not yet fulfilled by fujitsu  our semiconductor wafer supplier 
legal matters we are party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business 
although the outcomes of any such legal actions cannot be predicted  our management believes that there are no pending legal proceeding against or involving us for which the outcome would likely to have a material adverse effect upon our financial position or results of operations 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment  which requires all companies to treat the fair value of stock options granted to employees as an expense 
as a result of this standard  effective for periods beginning after january   we and other companies are required to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value of each stock option granted 
we are currently assessing our valuation options allowed in this standard 
this change in accounting standards reduces the attractiveness of granting stock options because of the additional expense associated with these grants  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
nevertheless  stock options are an important employee recruitment and retention tool  and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel if we reduce the scope of our employee stock option program 
accordingly  even though we have not quantified the dollar amount of this standard at this time  the result will have a negative impact on our earnings starting with the accounting period beginning january  in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs  an amendment to arb no 
 chapter statement no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of spoilage  freight and other items 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of this statement will not have any immediate effect on our consolidated financial statements  as the company is currently in compliance with its current inventory costing methodology

in contrast  apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
the provisions of this statement are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement 
adoption of this statement will not have any immediate effect on our consolidated financial statements  and we will apply this guidance prospectively
