overview packeteer is a leading provider of wan application optimization systems designed to deliver a broad set of visibility  control  compression and protocol acceleration capabilities to enterprise customers and service providers 
for enterprise customers  packeteer systems are designed to enable information technology  or it  organizations to effectively optimize application and network resources  while providing measurable cost savings in wide area network  or wan  investments 
for service providers  packeteer systems are designed to provide a platform for delivering application intelligent network services that control quality of service  or qos  expand revenue opportunities and offer compelling differentiation from other potential solutions 
the packeteer wan application optimization system consists of a family of scalable appliances that can be deployed within large data centers as well as smaller remote sites throughout a distributed enterprise 
each appliance can be configured with software modules to deliver a range of wan application traffic management capabilities 
packetseeker provides visibility  packetshaper provides control  and packetshaper xpress tm provides compression 
in addition  each appliance can be managed individually or as an integrated policy based wan application optimization system distributed across multiple locations  using our policycenter tm software product 
centralized reporting for multiple appliances is also available using our reportcenter tm software product 
our acquisition of mentat in december expanded our solution portfolio with technology for acceleration applications over satellite and long haul networks 
the mentat skyx products enhance the performance and efficiency of internet and private network access 
with a proprietary connection splitting and protocol translation system  the skyx gateway is designed to improve transmission control protocol internet protocol  or tcp ip  performance over satellite based or long haul networks while remaining entirely transparent to end users 
packeteer s products are deployed at more than  companies worldwide in more than countries 
our sales force and marketing efforts are used to develop brand awareness  drive demand for system solutions and support our indirect channels 
we believe that our current value proposition  which enables our enterprise customers to get more value out of existing network resources and improved performance of their critical applications  should allow us to grow our business again in our growth rate and net revenues depend significantly on continued growth in the wan application optimization market  our ability to develop and maintain strong partnering relationships with our indirect channel partners and our ability to expand or enhance our current product offerings or respond to technological change 
our growth in service revenues is dependent upon increasing the number of units under maintenance  which is dependent on both growing our installed base and renewing existing maintenance contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our product in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders and shipments  product mix  average selling price of our products and general economic conditions 
our failure to successfully convince the market of our value proposition and maintain strong relationships with our indirect channel partners to ensure the success of their selling efforts on our behalf  would adversely impact our net revenues and operating results 

table of contents sources of revenue we derive our revenue from two sources  product revenues and service revenues 
product revenues consist primarily of sales of our wan application optimization systems 
service revenues consist primarily of maintenance revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues 
product revenues accounted for  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
as our installed base grows  service revenues have increased at a faster rate than product revenues  accounting for  and of net revenues in  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues  which are included in service revenues  are recognized on a monthly basis  over the life of the contract 
the typical subscription and support term is twelve months  although multi year contracts of up to three years are sold 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of the cost of finished products purchased from our contract manufacturers  overhead costs  service support costs and amortization of purchased intangible assets 
we outsource all of our manufacturing 
we design and develop a majority of the key components of our products  including printed circuit boards and software 
in addition  we determine the components that are incorporated into our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
our overhead costs consist primarily of personnel related costs for our product operations and order fulfillment groups and other product costs such as warranty and fulfillment charges 
service support costs consist primarily of personnel related costs for our customer support and training groups  as well as fees paid to third party service providers to facilitate next business day replacement for end user customers located outside the united states 
additionally  we allocate overhead such as facilities  depreciation and it costs to all departments based on headcount and usage 
as such  general overhead costs are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
we must continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers as we develop and introduce new products and try to reduce production costs for existing products 
to the extent our customer base continues to grow  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our customer support group and expect that our fees to third party service providers will continue to increase as our international installed base grows 
beginning in january  we outsourced our manufacturing to two contract manufacturers 
during the second half of  we transitioned all of our manufacturing back to only smtc  our longstanding principal manufacturer 
in connection with this transition  we purchased all of the raw materials held by our other contract manufacturer for the manufacture and assembly of our product 
the purchase price for these materials included a handling fee of  which was expensed by us at the time of purchase to mark the materials to the lower of cost or market consistent with our inventory valuation policies 
smtc has purchased the substantial majority of these raw materials from us at this cost  and approximately  of the materials remained in our inventory as of december  we expect that smtc will purchase the majority of this inventory during the three months ending march  in order to meet our ongoing manufacturing requirements 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  allocated overhead  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and software 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on developing and enhancing our wan application optimization solutions 
we expect that in the future  our research and development spending will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to develop and maintain competitive products and enhance our current products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product and cost control objectives 
we expect that our research and development expenses in  excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  will approximate our long term business model target of of net revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses for those engaged in the sales  marketing and support of the product  as well as related trade show  promotional and public relations expenses and allocated overhead 
sales and marketing is 
table of contents our largest cost  accounting for  and of net revenues for  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest in appropriate sales and marketing campaigns and therefore expect sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars to increase in the future 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses in  excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  will approximate our long term business model target of of net revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated overhead and other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses in  excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense  will be in line with our long term business model targets of of net revenues 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  sales return and rebate reserves  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and other liabilities  specifically warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe the accounting policies below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware and software products 
revenue is generally recognized when all of the following criteria are met  as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
receipt of a customer purchase order is persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distribution channel are evidenced by an agreement governing the relationship together with purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier from packeteer or its designated fulfillment house 
for certain destinations outside the americas  delivery occurs when product is delivered to the destination country 
for maintenance contracts  delivery is deemed to occur ratably over the contract period 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement and are negotiated at the outset of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ significantly from our standard business practices  which are generally ninety days or less  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as the fees become due and payable 

table of contents we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
generally  product revenue is recognized upon delivery 
however  product revenue on sales to major new distributors are recorded based on sell through to the end user customers until such time as we have established significant experience with the distributor s product exchange activity 
additionally  when we introduce new product into our distribution channel for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance history  revenue is recognized on the basis of sell through to end user customers until such time as demand or acceptance history has been established 
we defer recognition of revenue on inventory in the distribution channel in excess of a certain number of days 
on the same basis  we reduce the associated cost of revenues  which is primarily related to materials  and include this amount in inventory 
we recognize these revenues and associated cost of revenues when the inventory levels no longer exceed expected supply 
no amounts were deferred under this policy as of december  or we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of our product and to training 
vsoe of fair value is based upon separate sales of maintenance renewals and training to customers 
accordingly  assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop revenue from maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken place 
to date  training revenues have not been material 
inventory valuation 
inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical usage and forecasted demand 
factors which could cause our forecasted demand to prove inaccurate include our reliance on indirect sales channels and the variability of our sales cycle  the potential of announcements of our new products or enhancements to replace or shorten the life cycle of our current products  or cause customers to defer their purchases  loss of sales due to product shortages  and the potential of new or alternative technologies achieving widespread market acceptance and thereby rendering our existing products obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
the company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with the company s determination that it has only one reporting segment as defined in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  the company has determined that it has only one reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on december in a two step process 
first  the company determines if the carrying amount of its reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if the company determines that goodwill may be impaired  the company compares the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss 
the company does not have any goodwill that it considers to be impaired 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 

table of contents sales return reserve 
in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgment and make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical return rates  as we believe they are the primary indicator of possible future returns 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues if for any period actual returns differ from our judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balances at december  and were million and million  respectively 
rebate reserves 
certain distributors and resellers can earn rebates under several packeteer programs 
the rebates earned are recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendors products 
for established programs  the company s estimates for rebates are based on historical usage rates 
for new programs  rebate reserves are calculated to cover the company s maximum exposure until such time as historical usage rates are developed 
when sufficient historical experience is established  there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebates if actual rebate claims are less than the maximum exposure 
additionally  there may be a reversal of previously accrued rebate reserves if rebates are not claimed before the expiration dates established for each program 
rebate reserves at december  and were million and million  respectively 
warranty reserves 
upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
to date  these problems have not materially adversely affected us 
warranty reserves amounted to  and  at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to sfas accordingly  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized 
management reviews deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and makes estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
during the three months ended december  and  we reversed a portion of the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and as a result realized a benefit of million and million  respectively 
without the releases  our provision rate would have been closer to instead of the provision we reported for and closer to instead of the benefit we reported for factors such as our cumulative profitability in the us and our projected future taxable income were the key criteria in deciding to release a portion of the valuation allowance 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payments which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 

table of contents apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in april  the sec announced that the accounting provisions of sfas r are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  as a result  we are now required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fixed income investments our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates and principal relates primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
in general our policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with less than three months to maturity from date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short term investments  and investments with maturities in excess of twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered to be long term investments
