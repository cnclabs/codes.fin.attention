overview we are a development stage biotechnology company engaged in research and development of products and processes intended to treat major medical indications such as cardiovascular disease and viral infections in which lipids  or fat components  play a key role 
our primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development including pre clinical studies  performing business  strategic and financial planning  and raising capital  including  from the date of the merger  disposing of company real estate assets 
accordingly  the company is considered to be in the development stage 
on november   we completed our merger with pre merger lipid 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was treated as a reverse acquisition because the stockholders of pre merger lipid owned the majority of the company s common stock immediately after the merger 
pre merger lipid was considered the acquiror for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  all financial information prior to november  included in this report reflects pre merger lipid results 
as a result of the merger  certain real estate assets were acquired  and thus our business was organized into two segments biotechnology and real estate 
on march   we formalized a plan to discontinue the operations of our real estate segment  and as of december   we had completed the disposition of substantially all of these real estate assets and our business is no longer organized into two segments 
the remaining real estate asset  classified as assets held for sale as of december   was sold in february for  therefore  as of the date of this filing  the company has no remaining real estate assets 
in the course of our research and development activities  we have incurred significant operating losses and we expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development and begin to allocate significant and increasing resources to clinical testing and other activities related to seeking approval to market our products 
we intend to finance our operations through corporate partnerships  technology licensing  the pursuit of research and development grants  public or private equity or debt financings  and cash on hand 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will provide sufficient working capital for our operations  which includes our current development projects  to the early part of in the longer term  we expect to additionally finance our operations through revenues from product sales and licenses  including outlicensing opportunities of our proprietary delipidation process for non human health applications such as the field of animal health  upon receiving all relevant approvals 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy our requirements we may have to substantially reduce  or eliminate  certain areas of our product development activities  significantly limit our operations  or otherwise modify our business strategy 
on july   we announced the completion of a non human primate study conducted at the wake forest university baptist medical center under the direction of dr 
lawrence l 
rudel 
this pre clinical animal study was designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the company s hdl therapy in a relevant human like model 
the study subjects  african green monkeys  a widely accepted model for human atherosclerosis  were first surveyed with intravascular ultrasound ivus to determine the presence and composition of atherosclerotic plaque 
the subjects received a sequence of weekly infusions of plasma that had been delipidated by lipid sciences proprietary process and device 
the data showed that the delipidated hdl infusions were safe and well tolerated by the study subjects 
the study animals were monitored before  during  and after each of the weekly infusions of delipidated plasma 
the data included over  assays of blood chemistry and physiological variables  such as blood pressure  heart rate  temperature  and respiration rate  collected throughout the study 
no significant changes in any of the monitored variables were noted during the course of the study 
after completion of the weekly infusions  a second ivus was conducted and the data was analyzed at the cleveland clinic foundation 
because of the limited number of study animals  there was insufficient data to reach statistical significance for the effectiveness portion of the study 
however  we noted an encouraging trend in the change in percent of atheroma plaque volume in the study subjects 
on august  we announced the passing of our chairman of the board  richard g 
babbitt 
mr 
babbitt died unexpectedly on august  at the age of vice chairman h 
bryan brewer  jr  md  and s 
lewis meyer  phd  our president and chief executive officer  will perform the duties of the chairman 
mr 
babbitt was elected to our board of directors and served as our chairman since september on september  we announced the completion of our exploratory investigation of the therapeutic effect of delipidated autologous virus in chronically siv infected rhesus macaques 
simian immunodeficiency virus siv is a widely accepted primate model for viral diseases like hiv 
the results of this study  conducted at the yerkes national primate research center at emory university  demonstrated that the administration of autologous siv viral antigen delipidated by our proprietary delipidation process to chronically siv infected non human primates led to the recognition of new epitopes of the virus by the animals immune system which was coincident with an improvement in the general indicators of overall health in these study animals 
statistical significance was reached both in the long term survival of these animals as compared to a retrospective  siv infected  non immunized control group  as well as a viral load reduction of approximately  that was achieved for the nine months duration of the study follow up period 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a much larger  controlled non human primate study to demonstrate both survival and viral load reduction in a statistically significant group of siv infected non human primates 
the study is designed to generate safety data and to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed therapeutic treatment 
we anticipate that these results could be used in the future application to the fda to support the initiation of a human clinical trial designed for the treatment of hiv infected patients  or for a potential offshore human study in collaboration with a corporate partner 
on september   we completed the private placement of  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share  for an aggregate offering price of approximately million  to institutional accredited investors the investors 
pursuant to the terms of the private placement  we also issued to the investors warrants and additional investment rights airs in the form of warrants 
as part of the transaction  we agreed to register for resale under the securities act all of the shares of common stock issued in the offering  as well as shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the airs and warrants  within thirty calendar days following the closing date of september  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec on october  that became effective on december  as a result  these shares sold in the private placement generally may be freely resold into the public markets 
in december  the company filed an ide application to the cdrh of the fda for their review 
in january  the fda granted conditional approval of the ide to allow the company to begin a human clinical trial with the company s pds the company was granted this approval subject to the condition that within days it would submit a response to the questions and observations made by the fda 
the company submitted its response on february   which was within days of receiving conditional approval from the fda 
prior to beginning our human clinical trial  we must also obtain approval from the institutional review board of washington  dc and submit that approval to the fda 
we expect to have completed preparations for the initiation of our human clinical trial at the washington hospital center by the end of the first quarter of  and anticipate that the initiation of our human clinical trial of our hdl therapy platform will begin early in the second quarter of results of continuing operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue 
we recognized  in grant revenue in  compared to  in this grant revenue relates to the small business technology transfer sttr grant awarded in the second quarter of by the national institutes of health nih  for a virion solvent treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
we have had no product revenues since our inception may  
future product revenues will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our hdl therapy and viral immunotherapy platforms 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include applied and scientific research  regulatory and business development expenses 
research and development expenses for decreased  or  to  from  in the decrease was due primarily to the absence of an  stock compensation charge related to the modification of our scientific advisory board members option agreements to extend the expiration date of these options  reduction in expenses related to our non human primate study at the wake forest university baptist medical center in winston salem  north carolina  which concluded in the second quarter of  and a decrease in process development costs related to our hdl therapy platform 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with our viral immunotherapy platform and an increase in costs related to the preparation of a human clinical trial of our hdl therapy platform  including costs associated with the development and manufacture of our pds device and disposables  regulatory compliance and clinical trial support 
research and development expense accounted for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  while we allocate and track resources when required pursuant to the terms of development arrangements  our research team typically works on different products concurrently  and our equipment and intellectual property resources often are deployed over a range of products with a view to maximize the benefit of our investment 
accordingly  we have not  and do not intend to  separately track the costs for each of our research projects on a product by product basis 
for the year ended december  however  we estimate that the majority of our research and development expense was associated with our two primary platforms  hdl therapy and viral immunotherapy 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our business operations  inclusive of management  legal and finance and accounting expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  from  in the increase was due primarily to an increase in expenses related to our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and an increase in investor and public relations expenses

as of december   all real estate assets acquired in the merger between nz and pre merger lipid had been disposed of  and therefore we did not have any income or loss to report for discontinued operations for the twelve month period ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the company recorded net income from discontinued operations of  as compared to a net loss of  recorded in the change was attributable to the absence of a valuation charge recorded on real property in california  a reduction in administrative costs as a result of the cessation of our real estate operations in arizona  and gains recognized on the sale of mineral rights and real property in new mexico

in connection with the private placement  approximately  was paid to ag edwards who acted as the placement agent for the transaction 
our principal uses of funds are expected to be the payment of operating expenses and continued research and development funding to support our hdl therapy and viral immunotherapy platforms 
the expected use of funds related to our hdl therapy platform includes costs associated with the preparation for and initiation of a human clinical trial 
the expected use of our funds related to our viral immunotherapy platform includes costs associated with our non human primate study 
the results of this study could lead to the initiation of a human clinical trial for the treatment of hiv infected patients  with approval from the fda  or to an offshore human study in collaboration with a partner 
we expect our principal sources of funds to be cash on hand 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments equal to approximately  we anticipate that these assets will provide sufficient working capital for our operations  which include our current development projects and human clinical trial  to the early part of we expect additional capital will be required in the future 
our board of directors continues to consider third party inquiries and explore strategic initiatives  public or private equity or debt financings  the formation of strategic development or licensing partnerships  and strategic business combinations 
however  there can be no assurance that funds secured from any of these efforts  if obtained  will be sufficient to meet the company s future cash requirements

off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  required that all registrants disclose and describe their critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition stock compensation the company accounts for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  thus  recognizes no compensation expense for those options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted  the company has elected to adopt the disclosure provisions only of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based awards to non employees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper assumptions to use in the computation of the amounts to be disclosed or recorded pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility and dividend yield of the option 
management bases its assumptions on historical data where available 
however  these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions  which are inherently uncertain  and are therefore subject to management s judgment 
income taxes the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
this statement is effective beginning with our first quarter of fiscal based on stock options outstanding at december   compensation expense related to employee stock option awards is expected to be approximately  in the amount and timing of total future compensation expense related to stock option grants will vary based upon additional awards  if any  cancellations  forfeitures  and modifications 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement changes the requirement for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retroactive application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements unless it is impracticable 
this statement is effective beginning with our first quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which outlines a three step model for identifying investment impairments in debt and equity securities within the scope of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 and cost method investments 
the three steps involve determining whether the investment is impaired  evaluating whether the impairment is other than temporary  and if the impairment is other than temporary  recognizing an impairment loss 
fsp carries forward the disclosure requirements of emerging issues task force eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its applications to certain investments 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of fsp will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of government issued securities 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are accounted for at their amortized cost  as per sfas no 
as of december   the amortized cost of our investment portfolio  which equaled approximately  exceeded the market value of the investments contained in the portfolio by approximately  we have both the ability and intent to hold the securities contained in the investment portfolio until their respective maturity dates 
additionally  all securities contained in the investment portfolio have maturity dates of less than one year 
therefore  we have concluded that this unrealized loss is not considered other than temporary  as defined by fsp and we have not booked any impairment charges related to this unrealized loss 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of our investment portfolio
