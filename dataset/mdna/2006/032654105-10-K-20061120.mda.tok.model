results of operations overview fiscal year net sales gross margin net income net income as a of net sales diluted eps net sales increased million  or in fiscal  from the amount recorded in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was offset by the impact of a million decrease in sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the loss of sales from our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line that we sold in the second quarter of fiscal net sales declined million  or  in fiscal from fiscal revenue trends by end market the categorization of sales by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product  the sold to customer information  the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated 
as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve  the categorization of products by end market can vary over time and when 
table of contents this occurs we reclassify sales by end market for prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing  or the underlying trends of results within each end market 
fiscal year industrial total sales y y computer total sales y y communications total sales y y consumer total sales y y total adi total sales y y industrial revenue from products sold into the industrial end market which includes factory automation  scientific and medical instrumentation  semiconductor automatic test equipment ate  defense electronics and automotive applications increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase reflects a broad based increase in demand for our products across a wide range of customers in this end market 
the industrial end market represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal sales to customers in the industrial end market decreased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of a decline in revenues from our customers in the automatic test equipment market in the first half of fiscal the industrial end market represented approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
computer revenue from products sold into the computer end market declined in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decline was primarily the result of refocusing our power management portfolio  lower sales of our personal computer audio codecs and an overall slow down in the personal computer market 
the computer end market represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal revenue from products sold into the computer end market decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the computer end market represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal years and communications revenue from products sold into the communications end market increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in sales of our products used in basestations 
these increases were offset by decreases in wireless handset revenue and decreases in sales to networking customers 
the sales decline attributable to networking customers was approximately million and was the result of the loss of sales from our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line  which we sold in the second quarter of fiscal the communications end market represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal revenue from products sold into the communications end market declined in fiscal compared to fiscal the decline was primarily the result of a significant decline in revenues from wireless handset customers in fiscal the communications end market represented approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 
consumer revenue from products sold into the consumer end market increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the success of our products in digital home applications and to a lesser extent in digital cameras and a broad array of audio and video applications 
the consumer end market represented approximately of our total revenue in fiscal revenue from sales in the consumer end market increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the consumer end market represented approximately and of our total revenue in fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents revenue trends by product the following table summarizes sales trends by product categories showing what proportion of our total sales are represented by each product category as well as the annual sequential growth rates for each product category 
the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products  the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications 
the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time 
in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing  or the underlying trends of results within each product category

table of contents the sharp reduction in sales of dsp based dsl asic and network processor products was a result of our decision to sell this product line in the second quarter of fiscal the wireless handset chipset sales are characterized by high sales volumes in periods of significant growth followed by periods of sales declines as demand for our product declines or shifts to our competition 
revenue trends by geographic region the percentage of sales by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last three years is as follows fiscal year region north america europe japan china rest of asia there was no major shift in the distribution of revenue by geographic region in fiscal as compared to fiscal the percentage of our net sales in china as a percentage of our total sales decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as the result of the changes in sales into the wireless handset end markets 
gross margin fiscal year gross margin gross margin the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily related to the increase in utilization of our wafer fabrication facilities and increased sales of higher margin products during fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by stock based compensation expense and restructuring related expenses  primarily accelerated depreciation of million  included in cost of sales during fiscal gross margin included an aggregate million of stock based compensation expense  restructuring related and acquisition related expenses in fiscal gross margin declined in fiscal by basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of the effect of fixed manufacturing costs allocated across lower levels of production in fiscal stock based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal  on october   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
compensation cost is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of the options as calculated using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to make several assumptions 
one of the key assumptions is expected volatility 
for options granted prior to fiscal  we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options 
we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility 
this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which included consultations with several third party advisors 
we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market s current expectations of future volatility 
historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time during which our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines 
we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior 

table of contents as a result of adopting sfas r on october   the company s income before income taxes and net income for fiscal  are million and million lower  respectively  than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended october  are and lower  respectively  than if the company had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  using the intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas r under the modified prospective application method allowed us to recognize compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirement of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas r 
we used the graded attribution method to recognize expense for all options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
upon adoption of sfas r on october   we switched to the straight line attribution method to recognize expense for all grants made after october  the expense associated with the unvested portion of the pre adoption grants will continue to be expensed using the graded attribution method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  on october   we accelerated the vesting of all unvested stock options awarded to employees after december  that had exercise prices of per share or greater 
options issued to our corporate officers and directors were not accelerated 
unvested options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable as a result of the vesting acceleration 
because the exercise price of all the modified options was greater than the market price of our underlying common stock on the date of the modification  no stock based compensation expense was recorded in the statement of income in accordance with apb opinion no 
the primary purpose for modifying the terms of these out of the money stock options to accelerate their vesting was to eliminate the need to recognize the remaining unrecognized non cash compensation expense in our statement of income associated with these stock options as measured under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  because the approximately million million net of tax of future expense associated with these options would have been disproportionately high compared to the economic value of the options at the date of modification 
as of october   the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately million  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
research and development r d fiscal year r d expenses r d expenses as a of net sales r d expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal the increase in r d expense was primarily the result of recognizing million of stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r and an increase in employee bonus expense 
these increases were partially offset by the savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal r d expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal the decrease in r d expenses was caused by a million reduction in employee bonus expenses and reductions in other expenses of million as a result of our tight control over all other engineering expenses throughout the year 
these expense reductions were partially offset by a million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses 

table of contents r d expense as a percentage of net sales will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of net sales and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products  and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 
selling  marketing  general and administrative smg a fiscal year smg a expenses smg a expenses as a of net sales smg a expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from the levels recorded in fiscal the increase in smg a expenses was primarily the result of recording million of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas r and higher employee salary  employee benefit and employee bonus expenses 
these increases were partially offset by savings realized from the restructuring actions we initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line in the second quarter of fiscal smg a expenses for fiscal decreased by million  or  from the levels recorded in the decrease in smg a expenses was caused by a reduction in employee bonus expenses of million and reductions in other smg a expenses of million as a result of tight control over all discretionary spending throughout the year 
these expense reductions were partially offset by a million increase in salary and employee benefit expenses 
purchased in process research and development fiscal year ttpcom limited integrant audioasics total purchased in process r d we incurred charges totaling million for the write off of in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility associated with our acquisitions in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal there were no charges for the write off of in process research and development in fiscal or see acquisitions below for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
special charges fiscal and fiscal closure of wafer fabrication facility during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility located in wilmington  massachusetts 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or sfas  under our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees and general and administrative employees 
the severance benefit was calculated based on length of past service  and employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
as of october   of these employees remained employed at our company 
the employment of of these employees was terminated on november  the remaining employees will continue working over the next three months on the cleanup and closure of this wafer fabrication facility 

table of contents in addition to the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional expense during fiscal  which consisted of million of non cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and million for stay on bonuses 
we reversed approximately million of our severance accrual during fiscal the accrual reversal was required because some employees voluntarily left the company  other employees found alternative employment within the company  and there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments  normally paid as income continuance  were paid as lump sum payments  which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments 
we ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on november  we expect to incur additional expenses related to this action in the first half of fiscal of approximately million for lease termination  clean up and closure costs 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  the lease charge will be taken when we cease using the building and the cleanup and closure costs will be expensed as incurred 
the closure of this facility is estimated to result in annual cost savings of approximately million per year beginning in fiscal these annual savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately million in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings  and approximately million in smg a expenses 
reorganization of product development and support programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and dsp product programs 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
these employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
as of october   of these employees were still employed by the company 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal and the write off of property  plant and equipment and other items 
the remaining million relates to the severance and fringe benefit costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
these employees must continue to be employed until they are involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
as of october   of these employees were still employed by the company 
we do not expect to incur any further material charges related to this reorganization action 
these organizational changes are expected to result in savings of approximately million per year once fully completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal these savings are expected to be realized as follows approximately million in r d expenses  approximately million in smg a expenses and approximately million in cost of sales 
a portion of these savings associated with the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal have already been realized during the second half of fiscal operating income fiscal year operating income operating income as a of net sales the million increase in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in net sales and a basis point increase in gross margin percentage 
these increases were partially offset by million of stock based operating expenses associated with the adoption of sfas r and the million write off of purchased in process research and development from our recent acquisitions 
the special charges in fiscal were lower by million from the special charges recorded in fiscal 
table of contents the decrease in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily a result of a decrease in net sales  a basis point decrease in gross margin combined with a million special charge in fiscal year partially offset by a decrease in operating expense 
nonoperating income expense fiscal year interest expense interest income other income expense  net total nonoperating income nonoperating income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher interest income  which was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal non operating income for fiscal also included a million gain on the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line during the second quarter of fiscal the year to year increase in interest income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher interest rates as well as higher average invested cash balances 
provision for income taxes fiscal year provision for income taxes effective income tax rate our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 
the tax rate was lower in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the recording of tax benefits of million associated with the completion of an internal revenue service irs examination during fiscal  including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit 
in addition  the effective tax rate was higher in fiscal as a result of our repatriation of foreign earnings and the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in our deferred compensation plan as more fully described below 
on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated foreign income by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
during fiscal  we repatriated  million of accumulated foreign earnings 
under current tax law  the earnings repatriated prior to october  were taxed at a reduced effective tax rate 
as a result of this action  we recorded additional income tax expense of million in fiscal we had originally established a deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet with the expectation that the officers subject to the m limitation of the internal revenue code would not withdraw their balances from the analog devices  inc deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan  while they were still subject to the m limitation  and we would receive a tax deduction at the time of withdrawal  generally upon their retirement 
due to changes in tax law during that were enacted as part of the ajca  the laws associated with distributions from deferred compensation plans have changed 
as a result  in fiscal three executive officers who were subject to the m limitation withdrew  or indicated their intention to withdraw a portion of their balances from the deferred compensation plan 
we incurred additional income tax expense in fiscal of million as a result of the write off of deferred tax assets associated with balances accumulated in the deferred compensation plan 

table of contents net income fiscal year net income net income as a of net sales diluted eps net income increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of the increase in net sales  the improvement in gross margin percentage  the increase in nonoperating income and lower tax expense 
this increase in net income was partially offset by a year to year increase in operating expenses of million  primarily as a result of million of stock based operating expenses related to the adoption of sfas r and million of operating expenses related to the our acquisitions during fiscal these operating expense increases were partially offset by a million decrease in special charges in fiscal as compared to fiscal net income decreased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of the year to year decrease in net sales  a million tax charge related to the repatriation of foreign earnings and million of special charges recorded in fiscal the decrease in net income was partially offset by a million increase in interest income

related party transaction one of our directors  who has served on our board of directors since  became a director of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  in fiscal and continues to serve as a director of tsmc 
management believes the terms and prices for the purchases of products from tsmc are not affected by the presence of one of our directors on the board of directors of tsmc 
we purchased approximately million  million and million of products from tsmc in fiscal years  and  respectively 

table of contents approximately million and million were payable to tsmc as of october  and october   respectively 
we anticipate that we will make significant purchases from tsmc in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources fiscal year net cash provided by operations net cash provided by operations as a of net sales at october   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  million  a decrease of million from fiscal our statement of cash flows reflects the impact of million for allocating the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options over a period of several years between the financing and operating section of the statement of cash flows  as required by sfas r 
the primary sources of funds for fiscal were net cash generated from operating activities of million which is net of the million of non cash excess tax benefit discussed above  million of cash inflows from the net change in our short term available for sale investments  proceeds from the sale of a product line of million and proceeds of million from our various employee stock plans 
the principal uses of funds during fiscal were the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of  million  cash dividend payments of million  payments of million for acquisitions and capital expenditures of million 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operations decreased by million from the amount recorded in fiscal primarily due to a decline in net income of million 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal this increase was the result of million of cash flow from operations  million in proceeds from our various employee stock programs and million of cash inflows from the net change in our short term available for sale investments 
these cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of million of our common stock  the payment of million of cash dividends and additions to property  plant and equipment of million 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million during fiscal to  million at october  fiscal year accounts receivable days sales outstanding inventory days cost of sales in inventory accounts receivable at the end of fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount at the end of fiscal this increase was the result of higher sales in the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories at the end of fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount at the end of fiscal and days cost of sales in inventory at the end of fiscal increased by days from the amount at the end of fiscal approximately million of this increase relates to the inventory that was built in preparation for the planned closure of our wafer fabrication facility in california and approximately million relates to the capitalization of manufacturing related stock based compensation expense as a result of our adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal the remainder of the increase primarily relates to increased inventory to support anticipated higher sales demand 
current liabilities decreased to million at october   a decrease of million  or  from million at the end of fiscal the decrease in current liabilities was largely the result of a million net decrease in the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liability  primarily as a result of withdrawals by plan participants in response to certain provisions of the american jobs creation act  as more fully described below 
additionally  income taxes payable at october  decreased by a net of million compared to the end of fiscal  which was primarily as a result of recording tax deductions in for stock options exercised 
table of contents over a period of several years becoming available upon the completion of the irs examination 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to the increase in inventory held by our distributors as a result of increases in demand for our products during fiscal during fiscal  we distributed million from our amended and restated deferred compensation plan  or the deferred compensation plan  as a result of participant terminations or at the direction of the participants 
this amount represented compensation and or stock option gains previously deferred by those participants pursuant to the terms of our deferred compensation plan and earnings on those deferred amounts 
as a result of certain provisions of the american jobs creation act  participants had the opportunity until december  to elect to withdraw amounts previously deferred 
net additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared cash dividends totaling per outstanding share of common stock resulting in dividend payments of million in fiscal the payment of future dividends  if any  will be based on several factors including our financial performance  outlook and liquidity 
after the end of the fiscal year  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend is payable on december  to shareholders of record on november  and is expected to total approximately million 
on may   our board of directors authorized an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of common stock that may be repurchased under our share repurchase program previously adopted by our board of directors on august  from million to billion 
on march   our board of directors authorized the repurchase by us of an additional billion of our common stock  increasing the total amount of our common stock we can repurchase from billion to billion of our common stock 
under the repurchase program  we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors  the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the repurchase program 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  million of our common stock under this plan 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million of our common stock under this program 
as of october   we had million of authorization remaining under our repurchase program 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  payment due by period less than more than thousands total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases a deferred compensation plan b pension funding c total a certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses 
these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation 
prior to january   participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before july  the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment 
since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation to these participants in the more than years column of the table 
all other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability 

table of contents c our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
at october   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet financing as of october   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
the sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected

sfas requires companies to recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on sponsoring employers balance sheets and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year the changes occur 
it also requires the measurement date of plan assets and obligations to occur at the end of the employers fiscal year 
sfas is effective for us at the end of fiscal  except for the change in measurement date  which is effective for us in fiscal the effect on our financial statements is dependent upon the discount rate at our fiscal measurement date september  and actual returns on our pension plan assets during the year

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas during fiscal did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
asset retirements in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary 
while a portion of the reserve is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the reserve is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future 
table of contents periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
at october   we had gross deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we have conducted an assessment of the likelihood of realization of those deferred tax assets and concluded that a million valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
stock based compensation the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal requires that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
for options granted prior to fiscal  we used historical volatility to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options 
we changed our method of estimating expected volatility for all stock options granted after fiscal from exclusively relying on historical volatility to exclusively relying on implied volatility 
this change was the result of a thorough review we undertook which 
table of contents included consultations with several third party advisors 
we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in a more accurate estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it more appropriately reflects the market s expectations of future volatility 
historical volatility during the period commensurate with the expected term of our stock options over the past several years included a period of time that our stock price experienced unprecedented increases and subsequent declines 
we believe that this past stock price volatility is unlikely to be indicative of future stock price behavior 
options in our stock are actively traded on several exchanges 
implied volatility is calculated for the period that is commensurate with the option s expected term assumption 
because this term often exceeds the period for which there are exchange traded options in our stock  statistical techniques are used to derive the implied volatility for traded options with terms commensurate with the option s expected term of five years 
this calculation of implied volatility is derived from the closing prices of the company s stock and exchange traded options from the most recent five trading days prior to the grant date of the employee stock option 
in general  the higher the expected volatility used in the black scholes valuation model  the higher the grant date fair value of the option 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes grant date valuation 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
in general  the longer the expected term used in the black scholes valuation model  the higher the grant date fair value of the option 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option 
until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter s cash dividend  the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption 
cash dividends are not paid on options  restricted stock or restricted stock units 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest  and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of october  the represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period  therefore  the cumulative amount  on a compounded basis  that is expected to be forfeited is approximately of the aggregate options granted 
this analysis will be re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
should a loss be probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by us be incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for information regarding our commitments and contingencies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure our annual interest income would change by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at october  and october  would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i in the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months 
the short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at october  and october  currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro  primarily because our european operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at october   and october   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments  primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
