executive summary during we delivered on our previously announced strategy we improved the financial performance of our core stations romania  slovak republic  slovenia  ukraine by delivering an increase in segment net revenues of and segment ebitda of from  we completed the acquisition of the tv nova czech republic group  which has substantially increased the scale of our business and created opportunities to leverage our market size  and we increased our interest in our romanian operations to and in our slovenian operations to and reached an agreement to increase our interest in our slovak operations to 
the principal events since january  are as follows in may  we acquired the tv nova czech republic group for total consideration of us million  which owns and operates tv nova  the leading television channel in the czech republic  to finance our acquisition of the tv nova czech republic group in may  we issued senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of euro million approximately us million at the time of issuance  we also raised net proceeds of approximately us million by selling approximately million shares of class a common stock  on june   our class a common stock began trading on the prague stock exchange  we increased our interest in our slovenian operations to following the sale by marijan jurenec of his interest in pro plus during the second quarter of  in june  we performed an analysis of our croatian intangible assets and goodwill to determine if they were impaired in light of our modified strategy 
as a result of this analysis we determined that our croatian investment was impaired by us million for further information see part ii  item  note  goodwill and intangible assets  on september   we acquired galaxie sport  which operates the leading sports cable channel galaxie sport in the czech and slovak republics  page 
table of contents at the end of october  we entered into an agreement with our slovak partners to acquire a controlling interest in our slovak operations  and to increase our economic interest in those operations from to for total consideration of approximately us million including deferred consideration of us million payable on may  
following completion on january   we now own directly and indirectly an voting interest in markiza and a voting interest of in sts 
as a result of this transaction  we will begin consolidating the results of our slovak operations from january for further information see part ii  item  note  subsequent events  slovak republic  on october   we entered into an agreement with dertus finance group limited dertus providing for the purchase by us of a interest in ukrpromtorg llc ukrpromtorg  a company that owns and operates the gravis channel and channel in kiev and one other local channel in ukraine  for a total investment of approximately us million subject to any adjustment following an audit of the closing balance sheet 
this acquisition of additional distribution capacity in the ukraine  which was completed on january   is intended to complement studio and to allow the costs of our ukrainian operations to be allocated across multiple channels for further information  see part ii  item  note subsequent events  ukraine  and on february   we purchased an additional of pro tv  mpi and media vision from adrian sarbu for consideration of us million for further information  see part ii  item  note  subsequent events  romania 
we now own a voting and economic interest in pro tv and mpi and a voting and economic interest in media vision 
future trends as our markets mature  we anticipate more intense competition for audience share and advertising spending from other incumbent terrestrial broadcasters and  to a lesser extent  from local cable and satellite broadcasters 
we believe we are in a solid position to manage increased competition 
in the near term we intend to continue to pursue further improvements in the performance of our existing operations in order to maximize the potential for organic growth 
our priorities in this regard include pursuing sub regional efficiencies  especially between slovenia and croatia and between the czech and slovak republics  supporting the growth of television advertising in our markets through increased pricing and through development of additional channels to expand our advertising inventory and target niche audiences  leveraging our existing brands and assets to develop new revenue opportunities  including in the creation and distribution of programming and in the new media sectors  and continuing to expand our footprint into additional central and eastern european markets when financially prudent opportunities arise 
in particular  we are planning the following during we intend to pursue improvements in the effectiveness of our operations in the czech republic and in the slovak republic  where we acquired control in early we have identified potential opportunities and are implementing measures to reduce operating expenses and streamline the operating structures of those operations  including in the areas of production and programming  and to reorient the advertising sales strategy to drive the expansion of revenues 
the focus of the tv nova czech republic group going forward will be the development of advertising revenues through price increases 
it is not possible to predict the impact of this change on the advertising revenues of the czech republic operations for on a full year basis 
we expect advertising revenues to decline in the early part of as the new advertising sales strategy is introduced 
however  we believe that the successful implementation of this policy and continued strong audience share and ratings for tv nova will lead to accelerated growth both in the revenues of the czech operations and in the television advertising market generally over the next several years 
page 
table of contents following the completion of our acquisition of a controlling interest in ukrpromtorg on january   we intend to re brand the channels and to expand their reach through the activation of the satellite license and acquisition of additional local and regional licenses with coverage of key population centers 
we will continue to seek similar opportunities to expand our footprint within each of our markets where possible 
we are planning to continue to invest in the development of our croatian operations as described in nova tv croatia development plan that we published in august we expect to continue to increase our audience share by acquiring higher quality programming by making additional strategic investments in local productions  as well as by making limited capital investments in order to extend the technical reach of those operations 
management changes effective april   marijan jurenec was promoted to the new role of director of the adriatic region with responsibility for our operations in croatia and slovenia  effective october   romana tomasov was appointed as director of corporate communications  responsible for investor  government and public relations  effective february   vaclav mika was appointed general director for the markiza tv channel  and effective february   we appointed adrian sarbu to oversee our operations in the czech and slovak republics in addition to his existing responsibilities as general director of our operations in romania

general market information emerging markets our revenue generating operations are located in central and eastern europe  namely the czech republic  croatia  romania  the slovak republic  slovenia and ukraine 
these emerging economies initially adopted western style democratic forms of government within the last fifteen years and have legal systems  systems of corporate governance and business practices that continue to evolve 
a lower level of development and experience in these areas within our central and eastern european markets  by comparison with other central and eastern european and western markets  increases the relative level of business risk 
page 
table of contents one indicator of the rate of development and the current relative level of business risk associated with economic development is coface ratings 
these are an assessment of the relative risk of payment default in different markets 
the table below indicates the coface ratings for each of the countries in which we operate 
for purposes of comparison with other central and eastern european markets and selected western markets  the united states and the united kingdom were both ranked a in  hungary was ranked a  poland was ranked a  greece and italy were ranked a and russia and turkey were ranked b 
country rating detail of rating rating rating rating croatia a an already patchy payment record could be further worsened by a deteriorating political and economic environment 
nevertheless  the probability of a default is still acceptable 
a a a czech republic a default probability is still weak even in the case when one country s political and economic environment or the payment record of companies is not as good as in a rated countries 
a a a romania a an already patchy payment record could be further worsened by a deteriorating political and economic environment 
nevertheless  the probability of a default is still acceptable 
b b b slovenia a default probability is still weak even in the case when one country s political and economic environment or the payment record of companies is not as good as in a rated countries 
a a a slovak republic a adverse political or economic circumstances may lead to a worsening payment record that is already lower than the previous categories  although the probability of a payment default is still low 
a a a ukraine c a very unsteady political and economic environment could deteriorate an already bad payment record 
c c d source coface usa 
country ratings issued by the coface group measure the average default risk on corporate payments in a given country and indicate to what extent a company s financial commitments are affected by the local business  financial and political outlook 
coface continuously monitors countries using a spectrum of indicators incorporating political factors  risk of currency shortage and devaluation  ability to meet financial commitments abroad  risk of a systemic crisis in the banking sector  cyclical risk  and payment behavior for short term transactions 
european union expansion the czech republic  slovenia and the slovak republic acceded to the eu in may we currently anticipate that romania will accede in and croatia is currently in accession negotiations 
accession to the eu is likely to bring certain positive developments 
all countries joining the eu become subject to eu legislation and we believe that the ongoing progress towards eu entry reduces the political and economic risks of operating in the emerging markets of central and eastern europe 
the reduction in political risk factors may encourage increased foreign investment that will be supportive of economic growth 
accession to the eu may also bring certain negative developments 
the adoption of eu compliant legislation in connection with accession may result in the introduction of new standards affecting industry and employment  and compliance with such new standards may require increased spending 
television advertising markets we derive almost all of our revenue from the sale of television advertising  most of which is sold through media houses and independent agencies 
like other television operators  we experience seasonality  with advertising sales tending to be lowest during the third quarter of each calendar year due to the summer holiday period typically july and august  and highest during the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
for the year ended december   of our total segment net revenue came from television advertising 
the per capita gdp in our markets is lower than that of western markets 
as a result of the lower gdp and weaker domestic consumption total advertising expenditure spending and consequently  television advertising spending per capita tends to be lower than in western markets 
however  as a result of television being commercialized in our markets at the same time as other media in our markets  television advertising spending tends to be higher as a proportion of total advertising spending in central and eastern european markets compared to western markets  where newspapers and magazines and radio were established as advertising media well before the advent of television advertising

the following table sets out our current estimates of the development of television advertising spending by market in us millions 
country croatia czech republic romania slovak republic slovenia ukraine market sizes are quoted at us dollar exchange rates applicable at the end of each year 
television advertising sales in the countries in which we operate  advertisers tend to allocate their television advertising budgets among channels based on each channel s audience share  audience demographic profile and pricing policy 
we generally offer two different bases of pricing to our advertising customers 
the first basis is cost per gross rating point which we refer to as grp 
a grp represents one percent of the population over the age of four 
the second basis is rate card  which reflects the timing and duration of an advertisement 
whether advertising is sold on a grp basis or a rate card basis depends on the dynamics of a particular market and our relative audience share 
cost per grp pricing advertising priced on a cost per grp basis allows an advertiser to specify the number of gross ratings points that it wants to achieve with an advertisement within a defined period of time 
we schedule the timing of the airing of the advertisements during such defined period of time in a manner that enables us both to meet the advertiser s grp target and to maximize the use and profitability of our available advertising programming time 
the price per grp package varies depending on the demographic group that the advertisement is targeting  the flexibility given to us by advertisers in scheduling their advertisements and the rebates offered by us to advertising agencies and their clients 
grp package sales generally allow for better inventory control than rate card pricing and optimize the net price per grp achieved 
rate card pricing advertising priced on a rate card basis is applied to advertisements scheduled at a specific time 
consistent with industry practice  we provide an incentive rebate on rate card prices to a number of advertising agencies and their clients 
the majority of our advertising customers commit to annual minimum spending levels 
we usually schedule specific advertisements one month in advance of broadcasting them 
prices paid by advertisers  whether they purchase advertising time on a grp package or rate card basis  tend to be higher during peak viewing months  particularly during the fourth quarter  than during off peak months such as july and august 
we recognize our advertising revenue at the time the relevant advertisement is broadcast 
as is common in the television broadcasting industry  we provide some advertising agencies and advertisers with incentive rebates 
we recognize advertising revenue net of these rebates 
for the purposes of management discussion and analysis total advertising revenue net of rebates is referred to as net spot revenue 
non spot revenue refers to revenue from sponsorship  game shows  program sales  text messaging  cable subscriptions as well as barter transactions 
occasionally  we enter into barter transactions pursuant to which we exchange advertising time for goods and services 
we record barter transactions at the fair market value of the goods or services received 
barter transactions represented of our segment net revenue for and for our goal is to increase revenues from advertising in local currency year on year in every market through disciplined management of our advertising inventory 
in any given period  revenue increases can be attributable to combinations of price increases  higher inventory sales  seasonal or time of day incentives  target audience delivery of specific campaigns  introductory pricing for new clients or audience movements based on our competitors program schedule

analysis of segment results overview we manage our business on a country by country basis and review the performance of each business segment using data that reflects of operating and license company results 
our business segments are comprised of croatia  the czech republic  romania  the slovak republic  slovenia and ukraine 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment net revenues and segment ebitda 
segment net revenues and segment ebitda include sts and markiza our operating and license company affiliates in the slovak republic for the year ended december  and sts  markiza and radio pro in romania for the year ended december  these entities are not consolidated under us gaap 
we acquired our croatian operations on july  therefore  comparable financial information is included from the date of acquisition only 
we acquired our czech operations on may  therefore  results are from the date of acquisition 
we do not include any detailed year on year financial results comparisons of financial results for our croatian operations and provide only qualified limited comparisons for our czech operations 
our key performance measure of the efficiency of our business segments is ebitda margin 
we define segment ebitda margin as the ratio of segment ebitda to segment net revenues 
segment ebitda is determined as segment net income loss  which includes costs for program rights amortization  before interest  taxes  depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets 
items that are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance  and therefore are not included in segment ebitda  include expenses presented as corporate operating costs in our consolidated statement of operations  foreign currency exchange gains and losses  and certain unusual or infrequent items eg  extraordinary gains and losses  impairments on assets or investments 
we use segment ebitda as a component in determining management bonuses 
for a full reconciliation of our segment net revenues and segment ebitda by operation to our consolidated us gaap results for the years ended december   and see item  note  segment data

table of contents market background we acquired our croatian operations on july  we estimate the television advertising market in croatia has shown local currency growth of approximately in and is expected to show single digit growth during national all day audience share for nova tv grew to in compared to in the previous year 
prime time audience share grew from to 
prime time ratings for the whole market increased from in to in we believe that this was due to the increased quality of the overall television offering in this market 
nova tv prime time ratings increased from to in this period 
net revenues for the year ended december  were us million compared to us million for the period from acquisition on july  to december  net revenue for the period from july fell us million or when compared to the equivalent post acquisition period in the reduction in revenue was attributable to lower barter revenues as some of these were forgone in accordance with our policy to minimize barter transactions 
net spot revenues increased by over the period from july to december when compared to the same period in  driven principally by growth in the volume of ratings sold 
croatian segment ebitda for the year ended december  was a loss of us million  which is substantially attributable to investment in programming to attract greater audience share 
costs charged in arriving at segment ebitda for included us million of programming costs  us million of other operating costs and us million of selling general and administrative expenses 
b czech republic segment financial information for the eight months ended december  us s czech republic net revenues czech republic ebitda czech republic ebitda margin results are presented from acquisition on may  market background we acquired our czech republic operations on may  during  we estimate the television advertising market in the czech republic grew by approximately in local currency 
after the office for the protection of economic competition of the czech republic began conducting an investigation during the fourth quarter of regarding potential infringements of czech antimonopoly legislation in respect of the sale of advertising on the tv nova channel from  cet has  without acknowledging any infringements alleged by the antimonopoly office  agreed to make certain undertakings in respect of the sale of advertising on tv nova 
upon acceptance of these undertakings by the antimonopoly office and subject to observance of them  the investigation will be terminated 
we have incorporated these undertakings into our new advertising sales strategy  which is designed to address the fact that the television advertising market in the czech republic has shown slow growth over the past several years compared to general economic growth rates 
this is due in part to broadcasters focusing on obtaining an increased share of revenues committed to television advertising rather than raising advertising prices 
the focus of the tv nova czech republic group going forward will be the development of advertising revenues through price increases 
it is not possible to predict the impact of this change on the advertising revenues of the czech republic operations for on a full year basis 
we expect advertising revenues to decline in the early part of as the new advertising sales strategy is introduced 
however  we believe that the successful implementation of this policy and continued strong audience share and ratings for tv nova will lead to accelerated growth both in the revenues of the czech operations and in the television advertising market generally over the next several years

average revenues per thirty second spot grew at a double digit rate for all three channels 
two thirds of the volume growth arose in pro cinema  which was launched in april and where average spot prices are lowest of the three channels 
most of the remaining volume growth arose in acasa 
because the increase in the volume of spots sold occurred principally on the channels with the lowest price per spot  there was an overall reduction in average revenue per thirty second spot across the three channels

our future cash needs will depend on our overall financial performance  our ability to service the indebtedness incurred under the senior notes as well as other indebtedness incurred by us and any future investment and development decisions 
our ability to raise further funds through external debt facilities depends on our satisfaction of a leverage ratio under the senior notes 
in the short term we are able to fund our operations from our current cash resources 
on february  we paid us million for an additional interest in our romanian operations see item  note  subsequent events in connection with our on going review of our croatian operations and following a strategic assessment of the performance of nova tv croatia undertaken during the second quarter  we modified our strategy for croatia in late june this new strategy requires higher current expenditures than had been planned prior to the strategic assessment in order to secure our audience and market share targets 
in order to achieve these targets  we increased our budget for the acquisition of higher quality foreign and domestic programming for and  for marketing and promotion including improvements to the on air look of nova tv croatia and accelerated investment for the extension of our technical reach 
we expect the increase in funding required to support nova tv croatia to be in excess of us million during we expect that  taken together  our current cash balances  internally generated cash flow  committed bank facilities  and local financing of broadcast operations should result in us having adequate cash resources to meet our debt service and other existing financial obligations for the next months 
the acquisition of additional shareholdings in our current operations  further investment in the expansion of existing operations or investment in the development of new revenue opportunities will require further financing 
we would expect to raise such financing through issuing debt or equity
