in hand with this change the company transferred the operations of the kettle valley dried fruit business to the sunopta fruit group  formed during the third quarter of in addition  the former staketech steam explosion group is now identified as the sunopta bioprocess group  reflecting the wide range of applications and markets being served by this group

the results of operations for the expanded reporting segments have been disclosed for and  but results have not been expanded due to reporting constraints 
the management s discussion and analysis md a  detailed below  is presented in five parts  critical accounting estimates  results of operations for versus including supplemental segmented information and versus  recent accounting developments  liquidity and capital resources  business and financial outlook and risks and uncertainties  and should be read in conjunction with the december  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on the company s historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
management continually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as the business of the company and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which management believes to be most important to the business of the company 
sunopta inc december  k revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
details of specific recognition by group are as follows i sunopta food group grain revenues are recorded when title and possession of the product is transferred to the customer 
possession is transferred to the customer at the time of shipment from our facility or at the time of delivery to a specified destination depending on the terms of the sale 
revenues from custom processing services are recorded upon provision of services and completion of quality testing 
all other food group revenues are recognized when title is transferred upon the shipment of product or at the time the service is provided to the customer 
ii opta minerals group revenues from the sale of silica free loose abrasives  industrial minerals  specialty sands and related products are recognized upon the sale and shipment of the related minerals 
revenues from recycling activities are recognized upon the sale and shipment or the disposal of non hazardous material received 
iii sunopta bioprocess group the percentage of completion method is used to account for significant contracts when related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company uses costs or hours incurred to date as a percentage of total expected costs or hours to measure the extent of progress towards completion 
license fees related to the right to sell the company s technologies are recorded as revenues over the term of the license  when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from its customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to the company 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory inventory is the company s largest current asset 
the company s inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a first in  first out basis  or estimate net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
sunopta assesses the net realizable value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of anticipated selling costs 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to the net realizable value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing the net realizable value including the quantity on hand  age and expiration  historical sales  consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
impairment of goodwill other intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fasb  the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
fasb requires that if the carrying value of a reporting unit for which goodwill exists exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
sunopta inc december  k as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the company has evaluated its goodwill for impairment and has determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceed their carrying value  and as a result no impairment of goodwill has been recorded 
goodwill of  is recorded in the financial statements as at december  during the year  the company impaired goodwill and a trademark in the amount of  primarily due to the exit of certain businesses 
in the company impaired trademarks with a pre tax value of  relating to the acquisition of first light foods in in the fourth quarter of the company made the decision to focus all future soy and rice shelf stable beverage packaging efforts in supplying existing customers only and to market aseptic packaging capabilities to the rapidly growing private label market 
the private label market in north america has grown substantially in recent years as retailers recognize the benefit of generating consumer loyalty with an in house brand 
as a result  the company has de emphasized the use of brands in the soy and rice shelf stable beverage market  and have written off the value of these trademarks recorded on the balance sheet 
accrued expenses and other assets the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made and received which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of capital taxes and estimates of amounts receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  management must make judgements regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from management s estimate 
income taxes the company is liable for income taxes in the united states and canada 
in making an estimate of its income tax liability the company must first make an assessment of which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on the company s balance sheet 
the company also makes an estimate on the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
management assesses the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgements had been used  the company s income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with the company s assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the valuation allowance

sunopta grains foods group dec  dec  change change revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income is defined as earnings before other income expense  interest expense net  income taxes and minority interest the grains and foods group contributed  in revenues in versus  in  a increase 
revenues were favourably impacted by the acquisition of earthwise processors in the second quarter contributing  in revenues and internal growth including internal growth on the earthwise acquisition of 
the group realized increases of  in aseptic based product sales due to the annualized impact of the vitasoy contract awarded in august plus increases in revenues with its other aseptic customers  increases in sunflower product sales of  due to higher prices in the early part of and additional supply due to additional contracted acreage in texas  increases in roasted products from the group s healthy convenience facility of  and  in additional food ingredient sales  primarily private sunopta inc december  k label esl soy products 
these increases were offset by revenue decreases of  primarily attributable to a reduction of liquid soy base sales  as a major customer continues to increase internal processing capacity 
gross margin in the grains and foods group increased by  in to  or of revenues  as compared to  or of revenues in better margin rates were realized on ip soybeans and soy based products due to the better crop year and certain soy based cancellation fees received which have no inherent costs 
aseptic margins have increased from to primarily due to margin improvement in the fourth quarter compared to last year due to a combination of increased volumes and the impact of numerous equipment upgrades and cost reduction initiatives 
sunflower margin rates are lower at compared to in due to the higher mix of low margin miscellaneous products related to the poor texas crop that was sold as bird seed in the third and fourth quarters 
the increase in operating income of  to  reflects the increase in gross margin as noted above  plus an increase in foreign exchange gains of  reflecting gains realized on euro contracts entered into to hedge against sales by the group in euros 
selling  general and administrative costs remained virtually unchanged at  however as a percent of revenues declined to from in the previous year  due in most part to synergies realized with the earthwise acquisition and higher revenues through existing facilities and with existing customers 
looking forward  s soy  sunflower and corn crops are in excellent condition  boding well for s throughput and gross margins  however ample world supply may also mean pricing pressure on certain products such as sunflower bakery kernel and soy beans 
the addition of a significant customer at the aseptic facility will increase revenues and margins at this facility and lower overall throughput costs due to the increased production base 
demand continues strong for both the groups esl soy beverage products and dry roasted ingredients and packaged products 
sunopta ingredients group dec  dec  change change revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income is defined as earnings before other income expense  interest expense net  income taxes and minority interest the ingredients group contributed revenues of  in as compared to  in  a decline 
the decrease is attributable to the year over year impact of the decline in the low carb market as oat fiber revenues decreased by  compared to the low carb market began to decline at the beginning of q the company is encouraged by the fact that for the first time in four quarters  oat fiber revenues in the fourth quarter were higher than the same quarter in the previous year at  versus  respectively 
the increase is due to the addition of new accounts  new applications including pet food and line extensions of the existing products 
bran products and the production of guar fiber products have also performed well in the year with increases of  and  respectively  offsetting declines in revenues of  due to a reduction in certain packaging and technical processing volumes 
gross margin in the ingredients group decreased by  and margin rate declined by from to 
the decline can be attributed primarily to the decline in oat fiber volumes and prices 
approximately  can be attributed to reduced margin rates caused by lower pricing and throughputs for oat fiber and  can be attributed to reduced margin due to lost fiber volumes 
the remaining net decline of  is due to higher energy costs  offset by lower depreciation expense and the impact of cost reduction initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  in versus  in the decrease is due to reduced bonus expense and improved focus on discretionary spending 
sunopta inc december  k the group had a foreign exchange gain in of  compared to a gain in of  previous year gains were due to the st 
thomas canada facility which was closed in mid operating income of  declined by  due to the factors noted above 
as previously  noted the demand for low carb products declined in many of the company s customers reduced their demand for oat fiber utilized in low carb applications  as they either suspended new low carb product development or worked through inventories built up in prior quarters 
the company also experienced significant competitive pricing pressure in this market and has been aggressively defending its market share 
these factors had a significant impact on the company s fiber facilities and the operating results of the ingredients group in however  fiber enriched foods and many new applications continue to grow and represent a significant opportunity going forward 
in hand with fiber fortification opportunities during the company expanded its focus on international markets for oat fiber and added a dedicated international sales resource to drive this business 
in addition  the company continues to assess a number of options to establish oat fiber processing in international markets 
during the company launched a line of organic oat fiber  organic soy fiber  organic okara and developed a unique process for the production of conventional soy fiber 
the company continues to actively develop its processes and research and development to expand its line of fiber offerings  including the development of both soluble fibers and insoluble fibers derived from sources other than oat  and new applications such as pet food

while a large number of companies compete within specific segments of the market  there are relatively few companies as well positioned as sunopta to take advantage of this rapidly growing market

initiatives to improve the productivity of the operations include  plant and warehouse rationalization programs  continued training and development of employees  consolidated procurement  supply chain and internal services programs and consolidated information and accounting systems to provide better analysis and timely decision making 
a more fulsome discussion of key strategies is included within item of this report

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and sunopta inc december  k money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported through profit and loss 
as at december  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer date debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and   of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of   at an interest rate of is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company looks at varying factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including  the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the companies ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates the company s after tax earnings would decrease increase by approximately  foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the united states dollar is also the company s reporting currency 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the company and its canadian subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
since  the canadian dollar has appreciated significantly against the us dollar with closing rates moving from cdn at january  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
the net effect of this appreciation has been a   exchange gain and a   increase in net assets 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of the company s net assets by  
the functional currency of all operations  located in canada  is the canadian dollar 
for these operations all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statement of earnings while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in the currency translation adjustment account within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the canadian dollar 
transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange gains losses on the consolidated statement of earnings 
us based food group operations have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time  potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
commodity risk the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  the company owned   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of and   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of
