our industry we operate in the oilfield service industry and provide products and services to oil and gas exploration and production companies for use in the drilling for and production of oil and gas 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
demand for our products and services by our customers is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for financial information by segment and a geographical breakout of revenues and long lived assets 
our financial results reflect the cyclical nature of the oilfield services business 
since  there have been periods of increasing and decreasing activity in each of our operating segments 
our well site services businesses  which is significantly affected by the north american rig count  had increased activity during  saw decreased activity in and early and has seen increasing activity from through the current period 
acquisitions and capital expenditures made in this segment have 
table of contents created additional growth opportunities 
in addition  the increased activity supporting oil sands developments in northern alberta  canada by our work force accommodations  catering and logistics business in this segment have had an important positive impact on this segment s overall trends 
our offshore products segment  which is more influenced by deepwater development activity and rig construction and repair  experienced increased activity during and as we shipped projects from our backlog which had increased in and in  activity in this segment slowed  however  backlog increased during and  which resulted in improved operating results during our tubular services business is influenced by some of the same factors as our well site services 
in addition  during and  this segment was significantly affected by increasing prices for steel products  including the oil country tubular goods octg we sell 
well site services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our well site services segment 
our well site services segment provides a broad range of products and services that are used to establish and maintain the flow of oil and gas from a well throughout its lifecycle 
our services include workover services  drilling services  rental equipment  work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services 
we use our fleet of workover and drilling rigs  rental equipment  work force accommodation facilities and related equipment to service well sites for oil and natural gas companies 
our products and services are used in both onshore and offshore applications through the exploration  development  production and abandonment phases of a well s life 
additionally  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services are employed in a variety of mining and related natural resource applications as well as forest fire fighting 
well site services market demand for our workover and drilling rigs  rental equipment and work force accommodations  catering and logistics services has historically been tied to the level of activity by oil and gas explorationists and producers 
the primary driver for this activity is the price of oil and natural gas 
activity levels have been and we expect will continue to be highly correlated with product prices 
products and services workover services 
we provide our workover products and services primarily to customers in the us  venezuela  the middle east  north and west africa  for both onshore and offshore applications 
workover products and services are used in operations on a producing well to restore or increase production 
workover services are typically used during the development  production and abandonment stages of the well 
our hydraulic workover units are used for workover operations and snubbing operations in pressure situations 
a hydraulic workover unit is a specially designed rig used for moving tubulars in and out of a wellbore using hydraulic pressure 
these units may be used for servicing wells that are not producing or for working on wells under pressure 
these units may be used for underbalanced drilling and workover and also in well control applications 
when a unit is snubbing  it is pushing pipe or tubulars into the well bore against well bore pressures 
because of their small size and ability to work on wells under pressure  hydraulic workover units offer some advantages over larger workover rigs and conventional drilling rigs 
however  most wells where we perform workover service are wells with no pressure 
as of december   we had stand alone hydraulic workover units 
of these units  were located in the us  five were located in venezuela  four were located in dubai  uae  two were located in egypt and two were located in the republic of congo 
in addition  we had labor and maintenance contracts on two non owned hydraulic workover units in algeria 
typically  our hydraulic workover units are contracted on a short term dayrate basis 
as a result  utilization of our hydraulic workover units varies from period to period 

table of contents our utilization rate for hydraulic workover units was in and during as of december   eleven of our hydraulic workover units were working or under contract and we had crews on two managed units in algeria 
the length of time necessary to complete a job depends on many factors  including the number of wells and the type of workover or pressure control situation involved 
usage of our hydraulic workover units is also affected by the availability of trained personnel 
with our current level of trained personnel  we estimate that we have the capability to crew and operate to simultaneous jobs involving our hydraulic workover units 
drilling services 
our drilling services business is located in odessa  texas  wooster  ohio and casper  wyoming and provides drilling services for shallow to medium depths ranging from  to  feet 
drilling services are typically used during the exploration and development stages of a field 
we have a total of semi automatic drilling rigs with hydraulic pipe handling booms and lift capacities ranging from  to  pounds 
we added one of these drilling rigs in  one in each of february and december  seven in february through our acquisition of elenburg and one in each of june and august fifteen of these drilling rigs are located in odessa  texas  eight in the rocky mountain region and four are located in wooster  ohio 
as of december   all rigs were working or under contract 
utilization decreased slightly from in to in we have assembled five of our new rigs that have been added to our fleet during through in our odessa  texas facility with components purchased from specialty vendors 
two additional rigs were under construction in odessa  texas at december   one of which spudded its first well in february and one which should commence operations by october we may continue to add rigs depending upon our market outlook 
we market our drilling services directly to a diverse customer base  consisting of both major and independent oil companies 
during we switched from billing on a footage basis to billing on a dayrate basis for many of our drilling rigs 
under a daywork drilling contract  the customer pays for certain costs that the company would normally provide when drilling on a footage basis and assumes more risk than on a footage basis 
the land drilling business is highly fragmented and consists of a small number of large companies and many smaller companies 
rental equipment

table of contents flexible bearings and connector products 
we are the principal supplier of flexible bearings  or flexjoints  to the offshore oil and gas industry 
we also supply connections and fittings that join lengths of large diameter conductor or casing used in offshore drilling operations 
flexjoints are flexible bearings that permit movement of riser pipes or tension leg platform tethers under high tension and pressure 
they are used on drilling  production and export risers and are used increasingly as offshore production moves to deeper water areas 
drilling riser systems provide the vertical conduit between the floating drilling vessel and the subsea wellhead 
through the drilling riser  equipment is guided into the well and drilling fluids are returned to the surface 
production riser systems provide the vertical conduit from the subsea wellhead to the floating production platform 
oil and gas flows to the surface for processing through the production riser 
export risers provide the vertical conduit from the floating production platform to the subsea export pipelines 
flexjoints are a critical element in the construction and operation of production and export risers on floating production systems in deepwater 
floating production systems  including tension leg platforms  spars and fpso facilities  are a significant means of producing oil and gas  particularly in deepwater environments 
we provide many important products for the construction of these facilities 
a tension leg platform is a floating platform that is moored by vertical pipes  or tethers  attached to both the platform and the sea floor 
our flexjoint tether bearings are used at the top and bottom connections of each of the tethers  and our merlin connectors are used to join shorter pipe sections to form long pipes offshore 
a spar is a floating vertical cylindrical structure which is approximately six to seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place 
our flexjoints are also used to attach the steel catenary risers to a spar or fpso and for use on import or export risers 
subsea pipeline products 
we design and manufacture a variety of fittings and connectors used in offshore oil and gas pipelines 
our products are used for new construction  maintenance and repair applications

backlog 
backlog in our offshore products segment was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we expect the majority of our backlog at december  to be completed in our offshore products backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled 
in some instances  these purchase orders are cancelable by the customer  subject to the payment of termination fees and or the reimbursement of our costs incurred 
although our backlog is an important indicator of future offshore products shipments and revenues  backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period 
we believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long lead time order cycle 
the change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long term trend

customers and competitors we market our products and services to a broad customer base  including the direct end users  engineering and design companies  prime contractors  and at times  our competitors through outsourcing arrangements 
tubular services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our tubular services segment 
through this segment  we distribute oil country tubular goods  or octg  and provide associated octg finishing and logistics services 
table of contents to the oil and gas industry 
oil country tubular goods consist of downhole casing and production tubing 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute a broad range of casing and tubing  provide threading  remediation  logistical and inventory services  and offer e commerce pricing  ordering  tracking and financial reporting capabilities 
we serve a customer base ranging from major oil companies to small independents 
through our key relationships with more than domestic and foreign manufacturers and related service providers and suppliers of octg  we deliver tubular products and ancillary services to oil and gas companies  drilling contractors and consultants predominantly in the united states 
the octg distribution market is highly fragmented and competitive  and is focused in the united states 
we purchase tubular goods from a variety of sources 
however  during  we purchased from a single domestic supplier of the tubular goods we distributed and from three domestic suppliers approximately of such tubular goods 
octg market our tubular services segment primarily distributes casing and tubing 
casing forms the structural wall in oil and gas wells to provide support  control pressure and prevent caving during drilling operations 
casing is also used to protect water bearing formations during the drilling of a well 
casing is generally not removed after it has been installed in a well 
production tubing  which is used to bring oil and gas to the surface  may be replaced during the life of a producing well 
a key indicator of domestic demand for octg is the average number of drilling rigs operating in the united states 
the octg market at any point in time is also affected by the level of inventories maintained by manufacturers  distributors and end users 
demand for tubular products is positively impacted by increased drilling of deeper  horizontal and offshore wells 
deeper wells require incremental tubular footage and enhanced mechanical capabilities to ensure the integrity of the well 
premium tubulars are used in horizontal drilling to withstand the increased bending and compression loading associated with a horizontal well 
operators typically specify premium tubulars for the completion of offshore wells 
products and services tubular products and services 
we distribute various types of octg produced by both domestic and foreign manufacturers to major and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and other octg distributors 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
as a result  gross margins in this segment are generally lower than those reported by our other segments 
we operate our tubular services segment from a total of eight offices and facilities located near areas of oil and gas exploration and development activity 
we have distribution relationships with most major domestic and certain international steel mills 
in this business  inventory management is critical to our success 
we maintain on the ground inventory in approximately yards located in the united states  giving us the flexibility to fill our customers orders from our own stock or directly from the manufacturer 
we have a proprietary inventory management system  designed specifically for the octg industry  that enables us to track our product shipments down to the individual joint of pipe

independent third party inspection companies operate within these facilities 
tubular products and services sales arrangements 
we provide our tubular products and logistics services through a variety of arrangements  including spot market sales and alliances 
we provide some of our tubular products and services to independent and major oil and gas companies under alliance arrangements 
although our alliances are generally not as profitable as the spot market and can be cancelled by the customer  they provide us with more stable and predictable revenues and an improved ability to forecast required inventory levels  which allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently 
regions of operations our tubular services segment provides tubular products and services principally to customers in the united states both for land and offshore applications 
however  we also sell a small percentage for export to other countries  including brazil  cameroon  chad  columbia  congo  ecuador  egypt  equatorial guinea  gabon  germany  guatemala  hungary  netherlands  russian federation  scotland  trinidad  tunisia and venezuela 
customers  suppliers and competitors our three largest end user customers in the tubular distribution market in were chevrontexaco corporation  burlington resources and conocophillips 
our three largest suppliers were us steel group  lone star steel and maverick tube corporation 
although we have a leading market share position in tubular services distribution  the market is highly fragmented 
our main competitors in tubular distribution are privately owned distributors including total premier  red man pipe supply co  inc  bourland and leverich and pipeco services 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  of whom are in our offshore products segment  of whom are in our well site services segment and of whom are in our tubular services segment 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering employees located in canada and the united kingdom as of december  we believe relations with our employees are good 
government regulation our business is significantly affected by foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry  worker safety and environmental protection 
changes in these laws  including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations  could significantly affect our business 
we cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our future operations or earnings 
we also are not able to predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted 
we depend on the demand for our products and services from oil and natural gas companies 
this demand is affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally  including those specifically directed to oilfield and offshore operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas in our areas of operation could also adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services

table of contents cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations or enforcement 
some of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act and general maritime law 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under states workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and permit them or their representatives generally to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries with no limitations on our potential liability 
our operations are subject to numerous foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release and or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws  for which compliance is often costly and difficult 
the violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits  issuance of corrective action orders  assessment of administrative and civil penalties  and even criminal prosecution 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
further  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that substantial costs for compliance will not be incurred in the future 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies  could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify 
we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
the united states environmental protection agency  or epa  and state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for some types of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
some wastes handled by us in our field service activities that currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes 
this would subject us to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  cercla or the superfund law  and comparable state statutes impose liability  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently have operations on properties where activities involving the handling of hazardous substances or wastes may have been conducted prior to our operations on such properties or by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
these properties may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws and related regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously discarded hazardous substances and wastes or property contamination that was caused by these third parties 
these laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
in the course of our operations  some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and gas deposits  and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials or norm 
norm wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements  and any storage vessels  piping  and work area affected by norm may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements 
because many of the properties presently or previously owned  operated  or occupied by us have been used for oil and gas production operations for many years  it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of norm 

table of contents the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the epa or applicable state agencies 
many of our properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and or stormwater  and we have a system for securing and maintaining these permits 
in addition  the oil pollution act of imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws provide for administrative  civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and  together with the oil pollution act  impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning  as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges 
some of our operations also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants 
the federal clean air act and analogous state laws require permits for facilities that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality 
failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business generally decreased oil and gas industry expenditure levels will adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend upon the oil and gas industry and its ability and willingness to make expenditures which are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices 
demand for our products and services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies  including national oil companies 
if our customers expenditures decline  our business will suffer 
the industry s willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive drilling prospects and the prevailing view of future product prices 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
product prices have been at historically high levels over recent months  which has helped to substantially increase our financial results 
a sudden or long term decline in product pricing could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress levels of exploration  development  and production activity  often reflected as reductions in rig counts 
such lower activity levels could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
many factors affect the supply and demand for oil and gas and therefore influence product prices  including the level of production  the levels of oil and gas inventories  the expected cost of developing new reserves  the actual cost of finding and producing oil and gas  the availability of attractive oil and gas field prospects which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict drilling  the availability of transportation infrastructure  refining capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas  depletion rates  the level of drilling activity  
table of contents global weather conditions and natural disasters  worldwide economic activity including growth in underdeveloped countries  including china and india  national government political requirements  including the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting companies opec to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil  the impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations  the cost of developing alternate energy sources  environmental regulation  and tax policies 
extended periods of low oil prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease deepwater exploration and production activity and adversely affect our business 
our offshore products segment depends on exploration and production expenditures in deepwater areas 
because deepwater projects are more capital intensive and take longer to generate first production than shallow water and onshore projects  the economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies typically assume lower prices for production from such projects to determine economic viability over the long term 
perceptions of longer term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies can reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
because the oil and gas industry is cyclical  our operating results may fluctuate 
oil prices have been and are expected to remain volatile 
this volatility causes oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to change their strategies and expenditure levels 
we have experienced in the past  and we may experience in the future  significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes 
disruptions in the political and economic conditions of the foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect our business 
we have operations in various international areas  including parts of africa  south america and the middle east 
our operations in these areas increase our exposure to risks of war  terrorist attacks  local economic conditions  political disruption  civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt our operations  restrict the movement of funds or limit repatriation of profits  lead to us government or international sanctions  and limit access to markets for periods of time 
we do business in international jurisdictions whose regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the united states 
our business may suffer because our efforts to comply with united states laws and regulations could restrict our ability to do business in international jurisdictions  relative to our competitors who are not subject to united states laws and regulations 
our international business operations include projects in countries where our competitors who are not subject to united states laws and regulations  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  can gain competitive advantages over us by securing business awards  licenses or other preferential treatment in those jurisdictions using methods that united states law and regulations prohibit us from using 
for example  our non us competitors are not subject to the anti bribery restrictions of the foreign corrupt practices act  which make it illegal to give anything of value to foreign officials or employees or agents of nationally owned oil companies in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage 
we may be subject to competitive 
table of contents disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
we might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel 
many of the products that we sell  especially in our offshore products segment  are complex and highly engineered and often must perform in harsh conditions 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design  utilize and enhance these products 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force 
the demand for skilled workers is high  and the supply is limited 
we have already experienced high demand and increased wages for labor forces serving our well site services segment  notably in our accommodations business in canada 
significant increases in the wages paid by competing employers could further result in a reduction of our skilled labor force  increases in the wage rates that we must pay or both 
when these events occur  our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired 
the level and pricing of tubular goods imported into the united states could decrease demand for our tubular goods inventory and adversely impact our results of operations 
also  if steel mills were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to customers in the united states  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
us law currently restricts imports of low cost tubular goods from a number of foreign countries into the us tubular goods market  resulting in higher prices for tubular goods 
if these restrictions were to be lifted or if the level of imported low cost tubular goods were to otherwise increase  our tubular services segment could be adversely affected to the extent that we then have higher cost tubular goods in inventory 
if prices were to decrease significantly  we might not be able to profitably sell our inventory of tubular goods 
in addition  significant price decreases could result in a longer holding period for some of our inventory  which could also have a material adverse effect on our tubular services segment 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
historically  users of tubular goods in the united states  in contrast to outside the united states  have purchased tubular goods through distributors 
if customers were to purchase tubular goods directly from steel mills  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations 
our hydraulic well control and drilling operations and our offshore products business are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior operators or other third parties 
environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past  and they are likely to change in the future 
if existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition  including the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations  reduction or cessation in operations  and performance of site investigatory  remedial or other corrective actions 

table of contents we may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities 
our operations are subject to many hazards 
we face the following risks under our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits  and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage 
even a partially uninsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
we are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  we become the subject of various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations  products  employees and other matters  including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations 
some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold  and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired  even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses 
we maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses  and we are subject to various self retentions and deductibles under our insurance 
it is possible  however  that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
we might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry 
we sell our products and services in competitive markets 
in some of our business segments  we compete with the oil and gas industry s largest oilfield services providers 
these companies have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  our business  particularly our tubular services business  may face competition from business to business internet auction activities 
our business will be adversely affected to the extent that these providers are successful in reducing purchases of our products and services 
risks related to our operations we are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations 
our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate  most notably in canada and the gulf of mexico 
our canadian work force accommodations  catering and logistics operations are significantly focused on the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions permits exploration and production activity to occur 
the spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and  as a result  adversely affects our operations and sales of products and services in the second and third quarters 
our operations in the gulf of mexico are also affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions in the gulf coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months 
in addition  summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
during  significant disruption occurred in oil and gas drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico due to damage inflicted by hurricanes katrina and rita 
as a result  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
we might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our offshore products and well site services segments  particularly our patents relating to our flexjoint technology and intervention tools utilized 
table of contents in the completion or workover of oil and gas wells 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of our company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position 
if we do not develop new competitive technologies and products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
the market for our offshore products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater depths and harsher conditions 
if we are not able to design  develop and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology  our business and revenues will be adversely affected 
loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of management 
if any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our officers 
if we have to write off a significant amount of goodwill  our earnings will be negatively affected 
as of december   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets 
we have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses 
current accounting standards  which were effective january   require a periodic review of goodwill for impairment in value and a non cash charge against earnings with a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if we were to lose a significant supplier of our tubular goods  we could be adversely affected 
during  we purchased from a single domestic supplier approximately of the tubular goods we distributed and from three domestic suppliers approximately of such tubular goods 
we do not have contracts with any of these suppliers 
if we were to lose any of these suppliers or if production at one or more of the suppliers were interrupted  our tubular services segment and our overall business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the extent of the loss or interruption were sufficiently large  the impact on us would be material 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board  limitations on the removal of directors  on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares of common stock at a premium 

table of contents two of our directors may have conflicts of interest because they are also directors or officers of scf 
the resolution of these conflicts of interest may not be in our or our stockholders best interests
