we continue to focus on growing our subscription and corporate customer base while maintaining stringent cost controls 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase from net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  this is primarily due to an increase in our loss from operations related to additional sales and marketing and development expenditures due to the build out and sales efforts related to the i metrix suite of products 
capital expenditures  primarily for computers and equipment  totaled  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  the purchases were made to support our expansion and increased infrastructure 
in connection with our acquisition of fis in october  we issued  in promissory notes to the former owners of fis 
the notes were originally scheduled to mature on october  in march  we extended the maturity date of the notes such that the holders of  in principal amount of the notes agreed to amend and restate their notes to provide for  among other things  the following schedule of principal payments  on april    on april  and  on january  all payments have been made and no further obligations remain under these notes 
on march   we entered into a separation and release agreement with tom vos  our former president and chief operating officer 
under the agreement  we were required to make payments to mr 
vos of  in and  in  and  in we have also made three payments of  to a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of mr 
vos  one payment per year in  and on march   we affected a plan to align our cost structure with current business conditions 
these conditions include an anticipated reduction in technical services revenues related to the nasdaq contract  which began in the second half of  by approximately million annually 
the plan entailed a reduction in workforce of  which was effected in march we incurred severance charges of  in the quarter ended march  associated with the work force reduction and the separation and release agreement with mr 
vos 
in may  we sold  units for per unit in a public offering 
each unit consisted of two shares of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock 
an additional  units were sold to cover over allotments 
of the  shares of our common stock included in the over allotment units   were offered by a selling stockholder and we did not receive any proceeds from that portion of the over allotment 
we also issued to the underwriter of the public offering a warrant to purchase  units for a price of per unit 
prior to the redemption described below  the warrants issued as part of the units had an exercise price of and were exercisable until may  beginning november   we had the right to redeem some or all of the warrants at a price of per warrant at anytime after the closing price for our common stock equaled or exceeded per share for any five consecutive trading days by giving certain notice to the then warrant holders 
in march  we exercised our redemption rights by sending notices to holders of the outstanding public warrants issued in the may offering 
pursuant to the redemption notice  holders of the public warrants were given the opportunity to exercise their warrants until the close of business on april  after april   we redeemed any unexercised public warrants at a price of per warrant 
as a result   warrants were exercised in march resulting in gross proceeds of  and  warrants were exercised in april resulting in gross proceeds of million 
we paid  to redeem  warrants which were not exercised during the redemption period 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of million  which includes a certificate of deposit cd for million at that matures in january and a cd for million at that matures in february we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our then current stockholders would be reduced 

table of contents our future contractual obligations  which consist solely of operating leases  at december   in thousands  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from four primary sources seat based subscriptions to our web services  contracts with corporate customers for customized data  sale of our technical services to construct and or operate the technical systems our customers use to integrate our data and data from other sources into their products and services  and advertising and other e commerce based revenues 
revenue from seat based subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically twelve months 
revenue from data sales is recognized over the term of the contract or  in the case of certain up front fees  over the estimated customer relationship period 
revenue from technical services  consisting primarily of time and materials based contracts  is recognized in the period services are rendered 
advertising and e commerce revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance  and delivery if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 
several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectibility of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these evaluations include assumptions regarding future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized

r generally requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires the fair value on the grant date to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
the resulting cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in april  the sec deferred the effective date for sfas r to the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after june  we have adopted sfas r in the fiscal year beginning january   and the adoption will have a material impact on our net income and earnings per share

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we generally invest in short term  low risk instruments 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements

we do not use any derivative financial instruments
