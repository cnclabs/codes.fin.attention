certain other short term investments are classified as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets

under its current policies  the company invests primarily in high grade marketable securities and does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations

the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that the company makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and may retain outside consultants  lawyers and actuaries to assist in its evaluation 
the company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical because they involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
vendor allowances vendor rebates  credits and promotional allowances that relate to the company s buying and merchandising activities  including lump sum payments associated with long term contracts  are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as they are earned  in accordance with its underlying agreement 
off invoice and bill back allowances are used to reduce direct product costs upon the receipt of goods 
volume incentive discounts are realized as a reduction of cost of sales at the time it is deemed probable and reasonably estimable that the incentive target will be reached 
promotional allowance funds for specific vendor sponsored programs are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as the program occurs and the funds are earned per the agreement 
cash discounts for prompt payment of invoices are realized in cost of sales as invoices are paid 
warehouse and back haul allowances provided by suppliers for distributing their product through our distribution system are recorded in cost of sales as the required performance is completed 
warehouse rack and slotting allowances are recorded in cost of sales when new items are initially set up in the company s distribution system  which is when the related expenses are incurred and performance under the agreement is complete 
swell allowances for damaged goods are realized in cost of sales as provided by the supplier  helping to offset product shrink losses also recorded in cost of sales

other exit costs include estimated real estate taxes  common area maintenance  insurance and utility costs to be incurred after the store closes over the remaining lease term 
store closings are generally completed within one year after the decision to close 
adjustments to closed store liabilities and other exit costs primarily relate to changes in subtenants and actual exit costs differing from original estimates

any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that such settlement is determined 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in cost of sales 
costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is no longer needed for its originally intended purpose is reversed to income in the proper period

the self insurance liability for most of the workers compensation claims is determined based on historical data and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported
