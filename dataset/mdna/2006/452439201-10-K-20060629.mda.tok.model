many dvds also offer special features  enhancements and ancillary materials  such as special menu design  multiple audio tracks  behind the scenes footage  director commentaries  interviews and discographies  all of which we are able to develop in house 
exclusive acquisition 
we generally acquire exclusive rights to our content 
we acquire our exclusive titles from a wide range of content holders  including independent content suppliers producers music artists record labels artist management we also produce our own original entertainment content focused on dvd live performance stand up comedy  music concerts and urban genre content  and feature horror and other genre films 
we produce  market and sell our exclusive content according to exclusive license or distribution agreements 
we actively pursue and secure both domestic us and canada and international distribution rights to exclusive titles in a range of home entertainment formats 
in return for exclusive license rights  we pay royalties to our licensors 
royalties are expressed as a percentage of our wholesale net revenues derived from title sales 
typically  we pay royalty advances that are recouped against royalties earned on a title by title basis or  if cross collateralized  against groups of licensed titles from the same licensor 
our license agreements generally provide for a minimum distribution term of at least five years and often considerably longer 
some license agreements contain provisions for an extension of the distribution term if we meet specified performance milestones or if we are still unrecouped at the end of the distribution term 
in return for exclusive distribution rights  we generally tender net wholesale revenues to content suppliers  which are expressed as a percentage of wholesale revenues after subtracting our distribution fee and recouping costs allocated to the content owner such as production  manufacturing  music publishing  and marketing fees 
in some cases  the net profit of a title is split between us and the content supplier according to a contractual percentage 
in many cases  we pay and recoup advances or minimum guarantees on an exclusive distribution deal in a manner similar to an exclusive licensing arrangement 
while our core business remains the domestic acquisition and distribution of content on dvd  we seek to secure and exploit exclusive content with the broadest possible grant of home entertainment programming rights 
as part of our strategic goal  we may finance all or part of the production of some of our entertainment content 
the rights we retain in connection with our self financed productions generally cover all territories throughout the world  all now known and hereafter devised video home entertainment formats  and other formats for an extended term 
because of our growing library of exclusive titles in a wide variety of genres  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from the widespread support of the traditional dvd format and the hd dvd and or blu ray disc high definition formats 
we intend to continue expanding our exclusive dvd library 
egami media 
our wholly owned subsidiary  egami media  engages in the exclusive wholesale distribution of the digital rights to our catalogue of audio and video content 
the demand for the types of programming found in our catalogue continues to increase as new retailers enter the primarily online marketplace 
while big budget theatrical programs are becoming available in limited ways online  the vast majority of available online content is still niche or affinity video titles such as classic television shows  live music  live comedy  special interest and other programs 
egami seeks to differentiate itself competitively by being a one stop source for the large  diverse collection of entertainment represented by our digital catalogue 
egami enters into nonexclusive distribution arrangements with retail and consumer facing entities whose business models are solely or partially the digital delivery of content 
delivery will be in the form of secure encoded files with playback options being controlled by embedded digital rights management drm 
in video  the consumer will find various purchasing options that include download to own download to rent vod subscription based rental models svod download to own is essentially the digital equivalent of buying a dvd 
download to rent is also referred to as vod and is becoming a key transactional component to most of our partner retailers 
subscription based rental models svod are essentially the digital equivalent of a club type model  where users pay recurring monthly fees in exchange for access to a library without individual transaction charges 
the audio marketplace is more mature  yet audio business models continue to evolve 
egami is selling full albums  individual tracks and also supporting subscription based access to our library of content 
additionally  egami is working closely with several audio retailers as they develop plans to add digital video to their offerings 
the mobile or wireless space is also a developing channel for egami 
as technical advances occur  the delivery of video to mobile phones is becoming more commonplace 
we are working with third party content suppliers by providing video content for emerging subscription based services 
emerging retail channels for egami include kiosk based sale of audio and video content  delivery of video content via closed college campus networks and through public libraries  advertising supported online models and various proprietary set top box retail initiatives

additionally  production and distribution services are performed by our personnel out of our headquarters in chatsworth  california

except for a small number of digital titles distributed by egami  we do not generally distribute nonexclusive content  such as dvd releases of major motion pictures 
additional value added services 
we provide a full range of value added services relative to our licensed content and many of our exclusively distributed titles  including creation of packaging distribution dvd authoring and compression for some titles  the addition of menu design enhancements such as video master quality control multiple audio tracks manufacturing commentaries marketing foreign language tracks sales behind the scenes footage music clearance interviews warehousing discographies these services are typically performed in house  with the exception of dvd  cd and umd disc manufacturing and tape replication  package printing  and packaging of the finished product which are generally performed by third party vendors 
distribution services 
we recently launched a new initiative called image entertainment distribution services  which offers a menu of distribution services to choose from  including sales  marketing  distribution and collections to independent audio and video labels 
this new initiative leverages our direct selling and retail relationships  existing distribution infrastructure  and emerging vendor managed inventory vmi capabilities 
manufacturing 
typically  a content supplier delivers a title master and artwork to us  and our in house post production facility creates a sub master with specifications for the necessary format and on screen menus for each title 
our in house authoring and compression team then generally performs the work necessary to prepare a dvd master for manufacturing 
occasionally  because of the large volume of our exclusive releases  we may use an outside facility to perform such services 
our in house creative services department  staffed with graphic designers  copywriters and proofreaders  creates original and innovative packaging fundamental to the marketing success of our product 
during fiscal and in the years prior  we used deluxe media services  inc  formerly ritek global media  to manufacture and package our domestic dvd programming 
we have reached an agreement in principle with sonopress llc to do so  subject to their final credit approval  and plan to move our replication during the second quarter of fiscal we primarily use u tech media usa dba glory tech llc for cd manufacturing 
sony dadc global currently manufactures all umd programming

returns of defective product have been minimal and are generally covered by manufacturers warranties 
as of june   we had approximately million of backlog orders  from dvd product  from domestic customers compared with approximately million of backlog orders  from dvd product  as of june  we expect to fill of the backlog orders  less any cancelled orders  this fiscal year 
international international sublicensing 
we hold worldwide distribution rights to over of our dvd titles and over of our cd titles 
we have an exclusive sublicense agreement for the distribution of our dvd content  primarily music related dvds  with sony bmg for europe  africa  and most of the middle east  an exclusive sublicense agreement with digital site  an affiliate of ray corporation  for japan  and an exclusive sublicense agreement with warner music group for australia and new zealand 
these agreements contain terms and conditions similar to those governing our underlying rights agreements 
sony bmg  digital site and warner music pay royalties based on either retail or wholesale revenues they generate  and are responsible for sales  taxes  marketing  publishing  manufacturing and distribution of our content in their respective territories 
we have similar sublicenses with others for smaller territories 
worldwide broadcast 
buyers of our standard and high definition broadcast content are typically cable  pay per view  or satellite broadcasters  and sometimes terrestrial free television or in flight on ship broadcasters 
under a typical broadcast license we receive payment of a one time  fixed  non refundable fee for a multi year exploitation term and in many instances for a specified number of airings 
with respect to pay per view  we typically receive a non refundable advance against royalties that are based on a percentage of customer buys 
our obligations under broadcast licensing are usually only to provide a broadcast master of the title and to ensure that music synchronization rights are secured 
we have an exclusive sales agency agreement with london based nbd television ltd  who sublicenses worldwide the majority of our current broadcast television catalogue of programming in excess of programs as well as our new release broadcast television acquisitions 
nbd represents us for conventional television broadcast sales  whether standard or high definition  including cable  pay per view  video on demand  satellite television  and sales to non theatrical venues 
programs that were sublicensed to third parties for broadcast prior to january will be handled by nbd upon the expiration of the existing sublicenses 
the agreement with nbd expires in january cost structure our most significant costs and cash expenditures relate to acquiring content for exclusive distribution and  more recently  the funding of content production or co production for exclusive distribution 
agreements to acquire programming typically come in the form of either an exclusive license agreement  where we pay royalties for the exclusive distribution rights  or an exclusive distribution agreement  where we generally receive distribution fees and pay net profits after recoupment of our upfront costs 
we generally base our offers of advances against future royalties or  for distribution agreements  advances against future net profit payments and in many cases production funding on the expected success of a title s performance at retail  actual cost of the production  and competition for the title s exclusive distribution rights 
upon entering into a typical exclusive license agreement  we pay  in advance  royalties which normally become due to the content supplier days following the quarter which the sale of dvd  cd  umd and vhs units of the title to our retail customers has occurred 
royalties are contractually expressed as a percentage of net revenues 
upon our recoupment of the advance  we pay the content supplier royalty overages at the same rate 
if we do not recoup our initial advance by the end of the agreement s term  the content supplier receives no additional royalties but is not typically liable for reimbursement of our unrecouped advance 
royalty advances may be used by the content supplier to actually produce the content in cases where the content has not yet been created 
under these exclusive license agreements  we are responsible for manufacturing  packaging  menu design  authoring and compression  package design and layout  selling  marketing and distribution expenses  and sometimes for music publishing in the case of music related dvds and cds 
under a typical exclusive distribution agreement  we may pay upfront fees  which are expressed as advances against future net profits  or we may pay for the cost of the content s production in advance 
our net profits for these deals usually take the form of our distribution fee which is deducted first 
any remaining net profits after we recoup our incurred costs and additional costs such as the cost of the content s production are generally paid to the content supplier 
we may also split any remaining net profits with the content supplier according to contractual percentages 
if net profits are not achieved  the content supplier receives only the production costs or distribution fees advanced  if any 
again  we recoup our incurred costs before any net profit disbursement is made to the content supplier 
in addition to advances  upfront fees and production costs  the other significant costs we incur are for dvd and cd replication packaging advertising  promotion  and market development funds provided retail customers domestic shipping costs from self distribution of exclusive content personnel costs music publishing on exclusive music related dvd and cd titles our financial focus is on achieving long term  sustainable growth and profitability 
we also seek to improve our cash flow position in order to continue licensing  or entering into exclusive distribution agreements for  high quality dvd and other entertainment content and funding operations 
competition when acquiring distribution rights for exclusive content  we continue to face increasing competition from major motion picture studios sony pictures disney fox paramount universal warner mini majors lions gate the weinstein company new line major music labels sony bmg emi universal warner music group independent music labels independent dvd and cd content suppliers for limited retail shelf space  we also continue to face increasing competition from major motion picture studios independent dvd and cd suppliers major and independent music labels who offer dvd content other home entertainment providers besides limited retail shelf space  we also face competition for retailer open to buy dollars  which are the purchasing budgets that retailers allocate to purchase new release or catalogue titles 
competition for content we face increasing competition from other independent distribution companies  major motion picture studios and music labels in securing exclusive content license and distribution rights 
although dvd player household penetration through sales of stand alone dvd players and dvd based video game player systems and retail shelf space for home video formats have started to reach a saturation point  companies are still viewing dvd licensing and distribution as an attractive business 
many  including new line  lions gate  and several of the major studios  are expanding efforts in the dvd licensing market  sometimes in the form of direct to video motion pictures 
because the home video rights to most newly released and catalogue motion pictures are already owned by the major studios  the market for high profile dvd content available to an independent supplier is limited 
moreover  the market for high profile music related dvd content is also limited as major and independent record labels continue to increase the number of music related titles released on dvd through their own labels 
in light of the increase in demand and limitation in supply  obtaining quality dvd content at reasonable prices is becoming ever more challenging 
our internal analyses and forecasts  which are designed with the goal of timely advance recoupment  attempt to limit the upfront advances against future royalties or  for distribution agreements  production and net profit payments we are willing to pay to secure content rights 
accordingly  we may not be able to remain competitive against offers from competitors who may at times be willing to pay larger advances 
this challenge is compounded when competitors who lack broad expertise in the field of dvd licensing occasionally offer advances or other terms for content which we believe to be unrealistic based upon our own internal forecasts and historical experience in particular genres 
although such unrealistic offers might have adverse effects on these competitors businesses in the medium and long term  the short term effect appears to be an artificial inflation in content valuations  which effectively decreases our ability to obtain quality content 
additionally  as we see more and more opportunities for higher profile content  we are increasingly finding ourselves in competition with major motion picture studios  the mini majors and major music labels  who tend to have greater financial resources and the ability to offer higher advances by leveraging their market power including significant influence on retailer shelf space allotment with retailers in order to obtain larger quantities of product purchases 
with that said  we believe that we will continue to compete successfully in obtaining exclusive rights to home entertainment content 
this is due in large part to our ability to offer an array of other assets to our program suppliers  including the high quality of expertise and service our employees provide our status as an independent which allows freedom from the major labels  more creative control to the content creator  comparatively fewer obstacles in content creation  marketing and distribution  and comparatively simpler accounting for royalties and net profits to the supplier our long history and solid reputation of working effectively with artists  their management and other valuable suppliers of entertainment programming the quality of our finished titles our specialized marketing expertise in areas such as comedy  urban  latin  music related  broadway and special interest titles our wide ranging in house services our direct and long standing relationships with mass merchants and traditional and online retailers of entertainment titles competition for retail shelf space our exclusive content competes for a finite amount of shelf space against a growing supply of entertainment content from other suppliers 
new dvd releases generally exceed titles a week 
we believe this competition can be especially challenging for independent labels like us  because the new dvd releases of major studios often have extremely high visibility and sales velocity in the millions of units  and typically require more shelf space to support 
in light of the impact of major studio releases  our expenses with respect to providing market development funds and cooperative advertising dollars to our retail customers for items such as in store displays and store circulars continue to increase  even as the availability of these opportunities continues to decrease 
this selling of shelf real estate  whether real or virtual  is becoming more expensive as the total number of dvd releases continues to grow 
with the exception of our more popular new titles and top selling catalogue titles  it can be a challenge to obtain the product placement necessary to maximize sales  particularly among the limited number of major retailers who comprise our core customers 
additionally  even though the shelf space in many retail stores may not be shrinking  it is no longer growing at the rates we had previously experienced  and we are also beginning to perceive a retailer trend toward greater visibility for titles at the expense of quantity ie face out rather than spine out dvd placement 
this has the effect of reducing the total number of titles actually carried by a retailer  and since we tend to carry and acquire many different titles  this trend may have a disproportionate effect on us compared to the major studios 
retailers are also increasingly looking for studios and independents to pay to secure display and shelf space within their stores 
even some successful internet retailers now require paid participation in these types of programs in order to ensure visibility and positioning on their web sites 
some of these programs can cost as much as or more of a retailer s total order  although we may also realize significant advertising and marketing benefits from such programs  especially if they grant competitive benefits over other studios and independents that are unable or unwilling to pay 
as competition in our industry continues to increase  we expect that more retailers will adopt these types of programs  which would result in downward pressure on our gross margins 
vendor managed inventory vmi under a vmi system  product suppliers are responsible for monitoring  stocking  and fulfilling directly to individual retail stores and outlets 
larger retailers  who have been transacting business via vmi with the major studios for years  are starting to require smaller independents ie product suppliers other than major studios  music labels and mini majors to adopt this method of inventory management 
an existing large retail customer of ours plans to restrict content suppliers from shipping product directly to its stores unless they carry a required minimum number of national titles 
image  along with other independents  has formed a consortium of program suppliers to consolidate shipments in order to satisfy this retailer 
under this arrangement  each member of the consortium retains its existing direct selling and direct billing relationship with this retailer 
our vmi group is currently one of only three independent groups partnering with this retailer 
consortium shipments to this customer will consolidate products from all suppliers in this group  which will result in larger shipments with freight costs shared among the members 
we have fully implemented all of the necessary vmi software and systems  and are currently in the final stages of deploying our vmi program with this customer 
we expect our vmi system to be fully tested and deployed by august  we will evaluate the possibility of deploying our vmi system at other retail customers as opportunities arise 
with respect to long term benefits  we expect the implementation of vmi relationships with retail customers to sell more units and reduce returned items by better matching inventory to real time demand reduce potential overproduction and excess inventory quantities by more accurately forecasting orders reduce processing and warehousing fees by maintaining a leaner supply chain increase our importance as a direct supplier of participating retail partners competition for retailer open to buy dollars we compete with other content suppliers for limited open to buy dollars allocated by retailers to purchase new release or catalogue dvd and cd titles 
open to buy dollars are becoming more scarce for independents like us  since such dollars are often devoted to high profile new releases from major studios  particularly during the holiday season 
reduced wholesale dvd pricing instituted by the major studios and labels  coupled with their ongoing catalogue campaigns and marketing muscle  has also increased competition for open to buy dollars 
most studios and labels are subsidiaries of much larger media conglomerates that have financial resources far greater than ours 
we believe that titles from an independent content supplier like us continue to be attractive to retailers because of the gross margins retained by the retailers from the sale of independent titles 
in contrast  there is a great deal of pricing competition among retailers for the new release theatrical blockbusters  as such major hits are often advertised as loss leaders to bring in retail traffic 
we do not sell new release major studio titles 
increasing competition as our industry matures  with dvd set top and dvd game player penetration of us television households having exceeded at the close of calendar  and the amount of retail space allocated for dvd programming leveling off  the competition level among content suppliers will continue to rise 
the major studios remain consistent and prolific in their ability to bring new theatrical titles to retailers 
they have large libraries of content to release on dvd 
new independent suppliers are continually emerging  further adding to the competition 
the additional promotional opportunities and open to buy dollars may be severely compromised by the new major theatrical programming  new independent suppliers and the vast catalogues of content controlled by the major studios 
industry trends according to adams media research hollywood aftermarket report dated september   dvd set top penetration of television households will reach through december   excluding dvd game players  with million of million television households having at least one dvd player 
adams media expects this penetration to reach within the next five years 
this represents an estimated annual compound growth rate in dvd set top player households 
additionally  adams media estimates that dvd game player households without a set top dvd player amounted to million  or of television households  through december  they expect this number to decline to million  or of television households  within the next five years 
according to adams media hollywood aftermarket report dated september   consumer dvd sell through spending will increase to billion in  from billion in consumer dvd sell through spending is expected to grow to billion through  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
net supplier revenue from dvd sell through was billion in  up from billion in net supplier revenue from dvd sell through is expected to grow to billion through  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
annual dvd disc buys per dvd set top household were discs in  at an average price of per disc  slightly lower than discs per household in  at a lower average price than s per disc 
vhs sell through consumer spending continues to decline rapidly  down from billion in to million in we believe the continuing popularity of relatively high priced television content on dvd illustrates the consumer appetite for non feature dvd content 
catalogue ie all content including newly produced specialty and non feature content that does not qualify as a new release feature film dvd content is necessarily our focus in light of our diverse array of general and specialty content and the unavailability of new release feature films to us 
adams media reports hollywood aftermarket report dated april  that the new release feature market share of revenues continues to grow more slowly than catalogue market share 
in  of total dvd revenues including rental were represented by new release features  while represented catalogue categories 
in  only were features while catalogue grew to 
as evidenced by our selling patterns  mass merchants  warehouse style retailers  internet retailers and dvd distributors are growing their dvd revenues at the expense of traditional mall based and stand alone dvd only retailers 
the overall economic climate and the uncertainty surrounding some retailers efforts to reorganize or restructure their businesses may lead to an increased risk of customer bankruptcy within the dvd retail space as well as an increased percentage of product returns to us 
indeed  the bankruptcy of musicland holding corp 
in january appeared to confirm this current reality 
the musicland bankruptcy filing had a significant impact on the dvd industry  particularly on independents like us who were unsecured creditors of musicland 
we have also witnessed higher returns in the months following the musicland filing as a result of retailers becoming even more cautious and trans world entertainment corp 
who acquired musicland and its inventories consolidating its combined dvd stocks 
our product returns  as a percentage of our gross distribution revenues  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
dvd retailers who also specialize in cd sales are becoming increasingly vulnerable to mounting pressure from warehouse style and online discounters  who now routinely offer cds for sale  and from illegal downloading of music from the internet and other music piracy 
many cd retailers have tried to reduce the impact of these downward pressures by also selling dvds  video games and other merchandise 
nevertheless  as the musicland bankruptcy again demonstrates  reorganizations  restructurings  and a significant number of store closures among cd retailers appear to support a continuing industry trend toward consolidations and reductions within the retail space  including retail space dedicated to dvd 
meanwhile  our dvd and cd revenues from mass merchants and warehouse style retailers have increased 
the larger retailers typically return titles which do not meet their internal minimum sales velocities 
to save costs  other retailers with multiple retail locations return titles with low sales velocities in a particular store back to their vendors  like us  and reorder the same titles for sale in a different retail store 
to save the costs of returns processing at their own distribution centers  retailers generally require their vendors to incur such costs 
this practice has contributed to our higher returns percentages in recent years 
we believe that the dvd and cd return rates experienced by major studios and record labels are substantially higher than our return rates  due to the sheer volume of big budget theatrical and audio new releases sold into retail 
as noted above  our vmi system should improve sales and market data available to us 
we believe that the vmi system should increase sales velocity and decrease returns and shipping costs  although implementation has not yet occurred 
we expect our vmi system to be fully deployed at a major retail customer by our second fiscal quarter  and the projected cost of the system s software will be shared  at least  initially by the consortium meeting this retailer s minimum stocking requirements 
the typical dvd buying consumer has largely shifted from a catalogue programming focused early adopter to a mass market buyer driven by high profile  big budget theatrical films 
both major studio and independent dvd suppliers now see that the primary drivers of revenues are new releases  which generate both retail and consumer interest and also help drive the sale of catalogue programming 
we have a diverse catalogue of content  and according to dvd release report revised  we are the third largest source for music on dvd with titles in active release  behind only the majors sony bmg and universal  and we are the top source for special interest programming on dvd with titles in active release 
we typically add an average of over new dvd titles per month  with content spanning over many genres  to our current catalogue of over  active dvd titles 
in addition  we typically add an average of five new cd titles per month  and our current active catalogue contains approximately audio titles 
sales of our catalogue titles are affected by the strength of our new releases  continued customer demand and the availability of retail shelf space and retailer open to buy dollars

legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under government laws and regulations relating to employment and tax matters 
while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters  it is the opinion of management  based on consultations with legal counsel  that the ultimate disposition of known proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report  including the risk factors listed below 
if any of these risks occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks relating to our business 
we have a high concentration of sales from relatively few titles 
our top five fiscal new release exclusive titles ron white you can t fix stupid dvd and cd  chicago and earth wind fire live at the greek dvd  kiss rock the nation live dvd  the original twilight zone tv series seasons dvd  and beef dvd accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenues 
our top ten fiscal new release exclusive titles accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenues 
although catalogue sales of these titles continue to be relatively strong  sales for these titles nevertheless have decreased over time and will probably continue to do so until our rights expire 
net revenues from new release dvd titles  where a new release title is defined as released during fiscal  accounted for approximately of fiscal net dvd revenues and net revenues from catalogue dvd titles  where catalogue is defined as a title first released in a previous fiscal year  accounted for approximately of fiscal net dvd revenues 
revenues from new release and catalogue dvd titles accounted for approximately and of fiscal net dvd revenues  respectively 
if we cannot acquire titles of equal or greater strength and popularity  our future net revenues would be negatively impacted 
we have a high concentration of sales to relatively few customers 
for the year ended march   anderson merchandisers who supplies wal mart accounted for of our net revenues 
for the year ended march   anderson merchandisers  best buy and aec one stop group accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our net revenues 
at march   anderson merchandisers and aec one stop accounted for and  respectively  of our gross accounts receivables 
additionally  our top five customers accounted for over of our fiscal net revenues 
any combination of these customers filing for bankruptcy or significantly reducing their purchases of our programming would have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our top customers accounted for approximately of our fiscal net revenues 
we are not an exclusive supplier to any of our retail customers  and there is no guarantee that we will continue recognizing significant revenue from sales to any particular customer 
if we are unable to maintain the sale of our titles at their current levels to any these five customers  and are unable to find other customers to replace these sales  there would be a negative impact on our revenues and future profitability 
we may need additional funding to continue acquiring desirable programming 
availability of working capital is a substantial factor in our ability to produce and or acquire new content 
therefore  maximizing available working capital is critical to our business operations 
we may need to raise additional funds to acquire the rights to content or to create content we find desirable 
should additional funds be raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced 
if adequate funds are not available or unavailable on acceptable terms  we may find we are unable to fund expansion  continue offering products and services  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  and or respond to competitive pressures in the industry 
failure of our strategic alliances could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we have co production deals in place with dark horse  graymark and amicus  and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances with other third party content producers 
we will rely on our co producers to develop and produce films 
particularly when produced by independent filmmakers  each film is a separate business venture with its own management  employees  equipment and budgetary requirements 
there are substantial risks associated with film production  including contract problems with  or disability of  directors  actors and other key artistic and technical personnel  weather and other delays  damage to sets  equipment or film  and the inability of production personnel to comply with budgetary or scheduling requirements 
such problems could materially increase the cost of production  increase the amount of time between our expenditure of funds and receipt of revenues  or cause the project to be abandoned at any stage if further expenditures do not appear commercially feasible 
accordingly  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our strategic alliances  and any failure of our present and future alliances to produce commercially viable content at an acceptable cost could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  there is no assurance that we will be able to find further desirable strategic alliances as we continue pursuing new co production deals and similar relationships 
our current dvd and cd genre concentrations may become unpopular with our retail customers and end consumers  which may adversely affect our business 
during fiscal  our dvd title genre concentration was heavily weighted toward music related dvd programming 
during fiscal we were unable to further grow our audio business 
our audio business generated approximately of our total net revenues  compared to approximately in fiscal we may not be able to successfully continue to produce or acquire content in the same genres  or that we will achieve the same strength within the genres we were successful with in fiscal if we cannot compete successfully in the home entertainment market for higher profile dvd and cd content  our business may be adversely affected 
inventory obsolescence may adversely affect our business 
we maintain a substantial investment in dvd and cd inventory  and if we overestimate the demand for a particular title  we may retain significant quantities of that title in our warehouse 
retained inventory occupies valuable storage space and may become obsolete as our distribution term for the title expires 
although we may sell such inventory at a steeply discounted price toward the end of the distribution term in order to recoup our manufacturing  storage and other costs  there is no guarantee that a market will exist for a given title  even at the steeply discounted price 
additionally  our license and or distribution agreements sometimes contain terms  such as minimum royalties per unit and music publishing fees  which effectively prevent us from steeply discounting the price on some titles 
the transition to a new dvd manufacturer may adversely affect our business 
we intend to transfer our replication from deluxe to sonopress during our second quarter of fiscal ending september  any failure of sonopress to manufacture and deliver our product in a timely manner and with the same consistent quantity and quality that we and our customers have come to expect may adversely affect our revenues and profits 
additionally  should the need arise  we may be adversely affected by the period of time that we would need to direct manufacturing duties to another company 
problems distributing our programming internationally may adversely affect our business 
we distribute our programming internationally 
as a result  our business may be subject to various risks inherent in international trade  many of which are beyond our control 
risks faced in distributing our programming internationally include cancellation or renegotiation of contracts  changes in laws and policies affecting international trade including taxes  credit risk  fluctuating foreign exchange rates and controls  civil strife  acts of war  guerilla activities  insurrection  terrorism  changing retailer and consumer tastes and preferences with regard to our programming  differing degrees of protection of our intellectual property  cultural barriers  and potential instability of foreign economies and governments  and of which may adversely affect our international sales 
to date  we have not entered into foreign currency exchange contracts 
the majority of international revenues are generated by three sublicensees 
revenues generated from our international business segment are primarily derived from the manufacturing  marketing and distribution efforts of sony bmg  warner music group and digital site 
should any of sony bmg  warner or digital site default on their respective sublicense agreements with us or fail to successfully perform  an important part of our business strategy  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
we have direct and indirect foreign currency exchange risk 
although our sony bmg and digital site sublicense agreements are us dollar denominated  with these parties reporting to us and paying us in us dollars  the underlying sony bmg sales transactions are in euros and the underlying digital site sales transactions are in yen 
on june   the euro was equivalent to approximately us and the yen was equivalent to approximately us 
should the us dollar strengthen compared to either the euro or the yen  our sublicensors reported royalties to us on a title by title basis and in the aggregate would decline assuming consistent unit sales and thus reduce our revenues recognized 
we have an accumulated deficit and may incur additional losses 
we sustained a net loss for fiscal  and although we were profitable in fiscal  we also sustained net losses for the three fiscal years preceding fiscal our accumulated deficit at march   was million 
due to the inherent unpredictability of high profile content acquisition and competition for limited retail shelf space  we may incur losses again in the future 
inability to maintain relationships with our program suppliers and vendors may adversely affect our business 
we receive a significant amount of our revenue from the distribution of those dvds for which we already have exclusive agreements with program suppliers 
we can give no assurances  however  that titles in production which have been financed by us will be timely delivered as agreed or of the expected quality 
delays or inadequacies in delivery  including rights clearances  could negatively impact the performance of any given quarter or fiscal year 
we can give no assurance that such content will ultimately be purchased in internally forecasted quantities by our retail customers or ultimately desired by the end consumer 
we also cannot be sure that we will be able to renew these exclusive rights as existing agreements with program suppliers expire 
we also cannot assure you that our current program suppliers will continue to support the dvd format in accordance with our exclusive agreements  that our current content suppliers will continue to license titles to us on the current terms or on terms favorable to us  or that we will be able to establish new beneficial supplier relationships to ensure acquisition of exclusive titles in a timely and efficient manner 
the full exploitation of our rights requires us to conduct business in areas where our expertise is limited 
in order to fully exploit some of the rights we have acquired  we are required to conduct business in sectors eg internet  rental  broadcast  video on demand  in flight  satellite where we are not as experienced as we are in the dvd and home video sectors 
accordingly  when exploiting such sectors in which we are less experienced  we may realize a greater proportion of costs  or we may not realize as much of a proportion of revenue  as we would in the dvd and home video sectors 
failure to effectively implement our sales and marketing efforts may adversely affect revenues 
our sales team may be unable to continue to successfully compete against the more extensive and well funded sales operations of our current and future competitors  which could adversely affect our revenues 
loss of key personnel may adversely affect our business 
our success greatly depends on the performance of our executive management  including president and chief executive officer martin greenwald  chief operating officer david borshell  and chief financial officer jeff framer  as well as our five senior vice presidents responsible for the critical areas of content acquisition  legal  marketing product development  operations  and sales 
the loss of the services of key persons of our executive and senior management could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we may not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse and distribution facility  and our business could be harmed 
domestic wholesale distribution of our exclusive programming is fulfilled from a single warehouse and distribution facility in las vegas  nevada 
if we are unable to operate this facility for any reason  it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand 
because it is difficult to predict sales increases or declines  we may not manage our facility in an optimal way  which may result in excess inventory  warehousing and distribution problems 
our failure to handle inventory properly could result in unexpected costs  delays and harm to our business and reputation 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may adversely affect our business 
we maintain insurance to protect ourselves against various risks related to our operations 
this insurance is maintained in types and amounts that we believe to be reasonable depending upon the circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
however  we may elect to limit coverage or not to carry insurance for some risks because of the high premiums associated with insuring those risks or for various other reasons 
for example  we do not carry earthquake insurance in light of the steep increase in premiums in southern california after the northridge earthquake on january  occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our cash flows and overall profitability 
risks relating to our industry 
our success depends on the unpredictable commercial success of our programming 
operating in the entertainment industry involves a substantial degree of risk 
each music performance  feature film or other programming title is an individual artistic work  and unpredictable audience reactions primarily determine commercial success 
the commercial success of a title also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs or titles released into the marketplace  critical reviews  the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure activities  general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors  all of which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with certainty 
our success will depend in part on the popularity of our content which  in turn  depends on our ability to gauge and predict expected popularity 
even if a film achieves success during its theatrical release  the popularity of a particular program and its ratings may diminish over time  which may have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
timing and timeliness are also sometimes relevant to a program s success  especially when the program concerns a recent event or historically relevant material eg an anniversary of a historical event which focuses media attention on the event and accordingly spurs interest in related content 
decreasing retail shelf space may limit sales of our programming 
we face increasing competition from major motion picture studios  music labels and other independent content suppliers for limited retail shelf space and retailer open to buy dollars 
although the amount of retail shelf space for dvds had previously been growing in approximate correlation to the growth rate in penetration of dvd players  the leveling off of dvd player penetration has resulted in a similar leveling off in retail shelf space growth 
it is within this changing environment that our exclusive content competes for a finite amount of shelf space against a growing supply of entertainment content 
because the new dvd releases of major studios often have extremely high visibility and sales velocity in the millions of units  which typically require more shelf space to support  we may not be able to afford or obtain the product placement necessary to maximize sales  particularly among the limited number of major retailers that are our core customers  which could result in decreased revenues and gross margins 
see competition above 
dvd sales are not sustaining the same level of growth as before 
we believe that consumer interest in the dvd format is due partly to interest in building the consumer s personal dvd library of desired entertainment programming 
although our exclusive titles have generally shown stable sales over extended periods  as consumers build their dvd libraries  or with the introduction of new home entertainment formats  dvd sales may decline and adversely affect our operations 
in addition  the leveling off of dvd player penetration has clearly resulted in a similar leveling off in dvd sales growth 
see industry trends above 
our film production efforts may not be financially successful 
our co produced films are more expensive to create than our dvd co productions  and the time between our expenditure of funds and receipt of revenues is longer 
while much of our programming is sold to retailers on a sell through basis  the financial success of our filmed programming will depend on our ability to generate higher sales to retailers who primarily rent programming such as blockbuster  movie gallery  hollywood entertainment now a wholly owned subsidiary of movie gallery and netflix  as well as to mass merchants such as wal mart  costco and target 
our filmed programming may not ultimately be as desirable to our target customers as we would hope  which would lead to lower than expected sales  decreased profit margins or losses 
failure to effectively implement a transition to vendor managed inventory vmi may adversely affect our business 
larger retailers are starting to move toward a vmi system whereby independent suppliers like us would be responsible for monitoring  stocking and fulfilling directly to individual retail stores and outlets 
we currently have one major customer who is requiring vmi in the near future  and other customers are likely to follow suit 
we have fully implemented all the necessary vmi software and systems and are currently in the final stages of deploying our program at this retail customer expected to be fully deployed august  
we will evaluate additional opportunities to deploy our vmi system at other retail customers 
we cannot assure you that other implementations with other customers will be done in a timely and effective manner or that the vmi software we have implemented will be acceptable to other retail customers 
implementation of vmi requires capital expenditures for initial setup  installation and integration 
in addition  ongoing fees will be paid for software maintenance support  item planning  order management and picking  packing  labeling and shipping of product 
failure to implement vmi in a timely manner with other customers could result in decreased opportunities for shelf space or decreased margins  and may require us to sell to vmi customers indirectly through third parties who have already implemented vmi 
while we should be able to add other customers without significant additional costs or time once we implement vmi  there can be no assurance this will be the case  and vmi implementation may require additional freight charges as inventory is sent directly to retail stores and outlets in smaller packages with greater frequency 
conflicting high definition dvd formats may cause inefficiencies 
currently  two major platforms are competing to become the dominant high definition format  and talks to unify the platforms have been unsuccessful 
the hd dvd and blu ray disc platforms have both recently launched 
for many of our titles  we hold rights to both platforms  but simultaneously supporting both platforms will cause increased production costs and decreased efficiencies with respect to inventory management and sales 
moreover  competing platforms may cause a delay in high definition player market penetration  and mainstream acceptance of high definition dvd in general  as consumers may decide to wait and see which platform prevails before purchasing a player 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological advances 
the entertainment industry in general  and the music and motion picture industries in particular  are continuing to undergo significant changes  primarily due to technological developments 
because of the rapid growth of technology  shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment  it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on potential revenue from  and profitability of  distributing entertainment programming 
it is also impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on our ability to compete effectively in a changing market 
an increase in product returns may adversely affect our business 
as with the major studios and other independent companies in this industry  we experience a relatively high level of product returns as a percentage of our revenues 
our allowances for sales returns may not be adequate to cover potential returns in the future  particularly in the case of consolidation within the home video retail marketplace which  when it occurs  tends to result in inventory consolidation and increased returns 
our experience over two of the past three years has been one of increasing return rates  and we expect this trend to continue 
decreasing retail prices for dvds may negatively impact our revenues 
the home entertainment programming market in which we compete is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
many of our competitors  including major studios  are increasingly offering programming  particularly dvd programming  at lower prices 
they may be able to produce or secure content on more favorable terms and may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we are able to adopt 
while we strive to improve our operating efficiencies and leverage our fixed costs so that we can afford to pass along these savings to our customers in the form of lower prices  the industry trend of lowering prices may  over time  lead to higher levels of competition and  therefore  lost sales  decreased profit margins or decreased overall revenues 
illegal piracy may reduce our revenues 
the music industry is facing a major challenge in the form of illegal piracy resulting from internet downloading and or cd recorders 
this piracy has negatively affected industry revenues and profits 
although we currently derive only of our revenues from audio cds  we are hopeful that our proportional revenues in this sector will increase 
additionally  according to in stat  dvd recorders are gradually gaining greater market penetration shipments of personal video recorders pvr reached million in calendar  a increase over calendar as dvd recorders  pvrs and high speed internet connections become more popular  and the storage capacity of personal computers increases  we may face greater piracy concerns with respect to our core dvd business 
others failure to promote our programming may adversely affect our business 
decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support of programming which we license and distribute are important in determining the success of a particular music concert  feature film or related product 
we may not control the manner in which a particular artist  film or related product is marketed and promoted  and we may not be able to fully control our corresponding dvd or cd release 
although artists  record companies  studios and producers have a financial interest in the success of any such concerts or films distributed by us  any marketing or promotional decision or restriction by such persons may negatively affect the success of our titles 
additionally  the availability of retailer programs relating to product placement  co op advertising and market development funds  and our ability and willingness to pay for such programs  are also important with respect to promoting our exclusive titles 
if dvd cannot compete successfully with other formats of home entertainment  our revenues may be negatively impacted 
the dvd format competes with other formats of in home entertainment  such as network  syndicated  cable and pay per view television  and home satellite systems 
the dvd format also competes with new and emerging technologies in the entertainment industry  such as entertainment programming on the internet  video on demand  high definition television  digital videotape  and optical discs with greater storage capacity 
these alternate home entertainment formats and emerging content delivery technologies could negatively impact the overall market for our dvd sales  especially if we are unable to continue to adapt and exploit the development and advancement of such technology 
if we cannot continue to secure dvd license and distribution rights  our business may be materially adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to secure dvd and other license and distribution rights on terms acceptable to us 
see competition above 
major motion picture studios have normally not granted  nor are they expected to grant  exclusive dvd licenses to us for new releases and popular catalogue titles 
instead  the major motion picture studios will most likely continue to sell dvd titles directly to retailers 
we expect to continue to license exclusive dvd and other home entertainment format content  but we cannot assure you that we can remain competitive against licensing entities with greater financial resources or that independent program suppliers will not distribute their programming themselves 
in addition  our success will continue to be dependent upon our ability to identify and secure rights to exclusive content that appeal to consumers 
we may not possess satisfactory rights in our properties 
although we require satisfactory chain of title information to our exclusively licensed content  the risk exists that some programs may have a defective chain of title 
the validity and ownership of rights to some titles can be uncertain and may be contested by third parties 
our results of operations fluctuate based on seasonality and variability 
we have generally experienced higher sales of dvds and cds in the quarters ended december and march due to increased consumer spending associated with the year end holidays 
accordingly  our revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from period to period  and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results of any future periods 
in addition to seasonality issues  other factors have contributed to variability in our dvd and cd net revenues on a quarterly basis 
these factors include the popularity of exclusive titles in release during the quarter  late delivery or non delivery of dvd or cd content or rights clearances by our content providers  our marketing and promotional activities  our rights and distribution activities  the availability of retailer shelf space  the level of retailer open to buy dollars  the extension  termination or non renewal of existing license and distribution rights  and general economic changes affecting the buying habits of our customers  particularly those changes affecting consumer demand for home entertainment hardware  packaged media and digital content protecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our ability to compete in the home entertainment industry depends  in part  upon successful protection of our proprietary and intellectual property 
we protect our property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and media for limited durations 
despite these precautions  existing copyright and trademark laws afford only limited practical protection in some jurisdictions 
in some jurisdictions of our distribution  there are no copyright and or trademark protections available 
as a result  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions or portions or applications of our intended productions 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the resulting diversion of resources could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
from time to time  we may also receive claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
regardless of the validity or the success of the claims  we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against such claims  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our stock 
our second largest shareholder has nominated a competing slate of directors for our upcoming annual meeting 
lions gate entertainment corp 
is our second largest shareholder  holding approximately million shares representing approximately of the company 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission  lions gate states that it believes image s current board is not acting in the best interests of image and its stockholders in light of our independent committee s october   decision to reject lions gate s per share offer to purchase all of our outstanding shares 
on june   delaware s court of chancery ruled that the classification of our board of directors will be effective beginning with the upcoming annual stockholders meeting to be held on october  lions gate has nominated a complete slate of potential board members to compete for the six seats up for election 
should lions gate s slate obtain more votes than our existing slate of directors who are up for re election  then the composition of the board of directors will change  which will likely result in a change to our overall strategic direction 
lions gate s disclosure may encourage others to make similar or different proposals 
if such a transaction were to occur  owners of shares of our common stock would become owners of another company s stock  and be subject to all of the risks and uncertainties of that company including those disclosed in any public filings with the sec 
if our board of directors or its special committee determine the proposal is unfavorable  they may adopt additional defensive measures 
in addition  future purchases or sales of our stock by lions gate  or by third parties based on speculation  new reports  or future public filings relating to the proposal or our response  may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
lions gate may decide at any time to sell all or a significant portion of its shares of our stock  particularly if its slate of nominees is rejected by our stockholders  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall dramatically 
our stock price may be subject to substantial volatility  and you may lose all or a substantial part of your investment 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
there is a limited public float  and trading volume historically has been limited and sporadic 
over the last year  the closing price of our common stock ranged between and per share on volume ranging from  to over million shares per day 
as a result  the current price for our common stock is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our fair market value 
the price at which our common stock will trade may be highly volatile and may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including  without limitation  the number of shares available for sale in the market  quarterly variations in our operating results  and actual or anticipated announcements of new releases by us or competitors  including lions gate  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance  market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
any future sales of equity may significantly impact the market price of our common stock 
we currently have s and s registration statements for the issuance of our securities in exchange for either cash or other securities on file with the securities and exchange commission 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares that we may issue upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall 
we may incur increased costs as a result of laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters 
laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted or proposed by the securities and exchange commission and by nasdaq  will result in increased costs to us as we evaluate the implications of any new rules and respond to their requirements 
if our public float exceeds million at the end of our second fiscal quarter on september   we will become an accelerated filer and be subject to additional regulatory requirements  including section of sarbanes oxley which would require us to include in our annual report for the period ending march  a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
the additional costs and efforts to do so could be substantial 
if we remain a non accelerated filer  we will not have to comply until march  new rules could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs to comply with any new rules and regulations

acquisition and consolidation of home vision entertainment on august   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of public media  inc  a delaware corporation  dba home vision entertainment  from adrianne furniss and charles benton for million in cash  and changed its name to home vision entertainment  inc we completed the consolidation of all of home vision s operations into our existing facilities in chatsworth and las vegas and closed their chicago corporate headquarters and warehouse and distribution facility in october home vision was a privately held  chicago based publisher and distributor of home entertainment programming  specializing in independent  foreign and fine art films 
in addition to releasing its own exclusive titles under the home vision label it also co distributed with us the special edition dvd library of the criterion collection 
home vision was our first acquisition target with the corporate goal of enhancing our library of exclusive programming  distribution channels and sources of revenue 
we believe the acquisition offered us cost savings synergies by leveraging our infrastructure 
we believe the purchase price paid was fair considering the expected increase in revenue streams originating from the rights acquired  the net assets acquired  the expected cost savings our infrastructure afforded us and the expected increase in importance to retailers as a result of the added exclusive brands 
the home vision library contains over active titles  including the bbc productions of cs lewis classic books the chronicles of narnia  day of the dolphin starring academy award winner george c 
scott  allegro non troppo  george orwell s animal farm  the zatoichi collection aka the blind swordsman  and the yakuza papers 
in addition to acquiring the home vision library  we continue releasing new titles on a monthly basis under the home vision label 
the purchase price was financed by our existing revolving line of credit with wells fargo foothill 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the results of operations of home vision are included in our consolidated results of operations from august  we also entered into a consulting agreement with ms 
furniss  home vision s former president and chief executive officer  who assisted with our consolidation and will assist us in our content acquisition efforts 
payments under this agreement will total  for the three year term of the agreement 
we also entered into an employment and consulting agreement with home vision s former chief financial officer  who also assisted us with the consolidation 
payments under this agreement will total approximately  over the one year term of the agreement 
exclusive distribution agreement with the criterion collection on august   we also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with the criterion collection  a delaware corporation  to exclusively distribute their dvd titles in north america 
the agreement formalized previous distribution arrangements with us and home vision whereby we exclusively supplied different retailers with criterion s titles 
we now receive more favorable purchase discounts on criterion s dvd content as a consolidated purchaser  compared to when we purchased as separate entities with home vision 
we believe the criterion collection to be the world s premier producer of special edition home video programming  in which critically acclaimed domestic and foreign films are transferred to dvd with the highest quality of picture and audio  and special features including interviews with producers  directors and talent  behind the scenes footage  documentaries  featurettes  and more 
the criterion collection currently contains approximately active dvd titles in its library and releases an average of new titles each month 
the criterion collection has produced special editions of titles such as kurosawa s seven samurai and ran  scorsese s last temptation of christ  hunter s 
thompson s fear and loathing in las vegas  hoop dreams  and my own private idaho 
the criterion collection also controls the distribution of the merchant ivory collection  including howard s end starring anthony hopkins and vanessa redgrave  and maurice starring hugh grant and ben kingsley 
through its affiliate janus films  the criterion collection is also responsible for another library of excellent programming  including kurosawa s rashomon and cocteau s beauty and the beast 
pursuant to the distribution agreement  we are now the exclusive distributor for all of these programming lines and titles on dvd and all other optical disc formats 
we are paying criterion a million non recoupable distribution fee  payable monthly over the first twelve months of the term 
should we meet minimum purchase levels over the initial three years  the term continues through december  we also have the option to extend the term through december   with the payment of two additional  non recoupable payments on january  and if we suffer a major decline in purchases that cannot be attributed to a lack of titles  criterion has the right to terminate the agreement in years four and five  but we believe this is unlikely 
we have accrued the unpaid portion of the million fee as a component of royalty and distribution fee advances at march   and are amortizing the fee over the five year term to cost of sales in accordance with statement of position no 
amortization for the fiscal year ended march  was  lions gate proposal on august   we received an unsolicited proposal from lions gate entertainment corp 
to acquire all of our outstanding shares 
our board of directors formed a special committee to consider and evaluate the proposal 
after entering into a confidentiality agreement  we provided lions gate with extensive information with competitive information redacted to assist in its due diligence process  and lions gate made a revised proposal 
on october   the final proposal was rejected on the ground that it was substantially below what the special committee would find acceptable for stockholders 
stockholder rights plan on october   we adopted a stockholder rights plan 
the plan is intended to protect the interests of the stockholders from coercive  abusive or unfair takeover tactics 
many public companies and approximately half of the companies on the fortune list and two thirds of the companies on the fortune list have rights plans similar to the one we have adopted 
prior to adopting the rights plan  the board was concerned that a person or company could acquire control of the company without paying a fair premium for control or without offering a fair price to all stockholders and that  if a competitor acquired control of the company  the competitor would have a conflict of interest and could use any acquired influence over  or control of  the company to the detriment of our stockholders 
we consider the rights plan to be very valuable in protecting both our stockholders rights to retain their equity investment in the company and the full value of that investment 
we believe the rights plan represents a sound and reasonable means of addressing the complex issues of corporate policies 
issuance of the rights does not in any way adversely affect our financial strength or interfere with our business plan 
the issuance of the rights has no dilutive effect  will not affect reported earnings per share  is not taxable to the company or to stockholders  and will not change the way in which stockholders can trade our shares 
the rights will only become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain triggering events  and are then intended to operate to protect stockholders against being deprived of their rights so they can share in the full measure of our long term potential 
continuing our growth and maximizing long term stockholder value continue to be major goals of the board and management 
acceleration of vesting of outstanding unvested stock options on march   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved  and our full board ratified  the acceleration of vesting for all outstanding unvested stock options granted under the our equity compensation plans 
in connection with the vesting acceleration  the compensation committee and the board also imposed a holding period on the shares underlying the accelerated options  which would prevent the sale or other transfer of such shares until the date the shares would have vested under the original vesting schedule of the respective option  except that the holding period will end upon the close of a change in control transaction 
approximately  unvested stock options were accelerated with an exercise price below the closing price of on march  ie in the money  and approximately  unvested stock options were accelerated with an exercise price above the closing price ie out of the money 
the action to accelerate the vesting of unvested stock options enables us to minimize recognizing future compensation expense associated with our outstanding options upon our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the fair value of such stock based compensation that would have been recorded as compensation expense over the remaining vesting periods for the fiscal periods  had we not accelerated the vesting  totaled  approximately  for our fiscal year  beginning april   and approximately  over the remaining vesting period of the options 
potential acquisitions we continue to seek out viable acquisition targets to enhance our library of exclusive programming  distribution channels and sources of revenue 
on september   we filed a shelf registration statement that gives us the ability to sell our common stock in one or more offerings to raise cash for acquisitions  debt repayment or working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we also filed an acquisition shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to ensure that registered shares of our common stock are available to use as consideration in connection with our acquisition of the assets  bu sinesses or securities of other companies  whether by purchase  merger or other form of business combination 
the shares may be offered in separate transactions or  in the aggregate  in a single transaction 
subsequent event agreement in principle for a new disc replication agreement and related advance in june  we reached an agreement in principle with sonopress llc  for a five year replication agreement to act as our exclusive manufacturer of our dvd requirements 
this will include the hd dvd and blu ray disc high definition formats 
at our option  they may also replicate our cd requirements 
we will receive an interest free million advance against future replication from sonopress  to be repaid at per disc manufactured  plus payment of a administrative fee per disc manufactured until the advance is repaid 
all outstanding amounts under the advance are subordinated to all of our obligations outstanding to wells fargo foothill 
until the advance is repaid  sonopress will take a security interest in all the company s assets in second position behind foothill 
the proceeds from the advance will be used to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility with foothill 
the replication prices under this agreement are less than the current pricing under our current replication agreement with deluxe 
for future reporting periods  we will impute interest on the amounts outstanding under the advance during the periods and record such amount as interest expense with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital generally comes from two sources operating cash flows borrowing availability in december  we raised approximately million in net proceeds through the sale of our common stock 
in october  we received a recoupable but non refundable million royalty advance in connection with a new japan sublicense agreement 
we used the proceeds of the private placement and the royalty advance to repay our then outstanding borrowing under our revolving line of credit and term loan facilities with wells fargo foothill 
sony bmg recoupment we received a million initial royalty advance under the sony bmg agreement in march  fully recoupable from revenues generated by sony bmg against quarterly royalties due to us under the agreement 
based upon actual quarterly sales of our programming in the territories  sony bmg recoups quarterly royalties from the million previously advanced 
sony bmg had provided additional quarterly royalty advances such that for the first three years of the agreement term through december   the advance outstanding to us at any given time was maintained at million 
during the first three quarters of the fourth year of the term the nine months ending september   sony bmg will reduce  through recoupment  the outstanding royalty advance to million 
once the entire royalty advance is recouped  sony bmg will continue to pay quarterly royalties based on revenues generated 
during the fourth quarter of the fourth year of the term the quarter ending december   sony bmg may recoup the entire remaining balance of million by not re advancing royalties quarterly 
the agreement contains a formula to pay an additional lesser advance at the beginning of the fifth and final year of the term calendar which is to be recouped by sony bmg during that year 
we must repay any outstanding unrecouped royalty advance within days following the final sony bmg reporting at the conclusion of sony bmg s sell off period after expiration of the five year term 
at march   approximately million of the last million advance is classified as a component of deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet 
revolving credit and term loan facility on august   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement with wells fargo foothill 
the agreement replaces the existing loan and security agreement  dated december   as amended 
the more significant amended terms of the agreement are as follows  with other terms remaining generally unchanged the maximum revolving credit line limit was decreased to million from million actual borrowing availability remains substantially based upon eligible trade accounts receivable levels  the agreement term was extended two years through december   the prime and libor interest rate options on borrowings were reduced from prime plus or libor plus to a prime plus or libor plus if our average availability under the revolving line is less than million and b prime plus or libor plus for availability between million and million 
for availability greater than million rates drop to prime or libor plus the unused line fee was reduced to from  the clearance day charge and servicing fee were eliminated  allowable accounts receivable dilution  depending upon then availability  and customer receivable concentration limits were favorably increased  early termination fees were increased  the tangible net worth covenant was eliminated  and the minimum earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant was revised beginning with the quarter ended june   and a provision to the ebitda covenant was also added  such that we may not incur two consecutive fiscal quarters of ebitda losses  beginning with the quarter ending september  on november   at our request  foothill further amended the credit facility to provide for a higher maximum revolving credit limit during each monthly period from october through april during this period each year  the maximum borrowing limit under our revolving credit line will be increased from million to million actual borrowing availability remains substantially based upon eligible trade accounts receivable levels 
on june   at our request  foothill further amended the credit facility to waive our required compliance with the minimum ebitda requirement for the twelve months ended march  reduce the minimum ebitda covenant on a go forward basis  to million for the twelve months ending june   million for the twelve months ending september   millon for twelve months ending december  and march  and million of each twelve month ended quarterly measurement period thereafter amend the provision that we may not incur two consecutive fiscal quarters of ebitda losses  beginning with the quarter ending september  to also exclude the period ended march  and period ending june  consent allowing us to enter the new replication agreement with sonopress  receive the related advance as well as allow sonopress to take a subordinated security interest in our assets increase our early termination fees to on the maximum revolving credit amount either million or million as noted above and any outstanding borrowings under the capital expenditures line amount through june  and to through june  prior to the amendment  our early termination fees were through september  and thereafter 
at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of million and million  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities with foothill 
comparatively  at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of million  and million  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities 
at march   we had million borrowed under the line with million borrowed at prime plus at march  and million borrowed at libor plus ranging from to at march  
other sources and uses of working capital for fiscal we used cash flows from operations of million during fiscal  as compared with cash flows provided by operations of million for fiscal our pretax loss from operations was  for fiscal during fiscal as compared to fiscal we used substantial operating cash toward advance royalties  recoupable production costs and distribution fees for the acquisition of exclusive content for new release and future releases 
during fiscal  we advanced million upon execution of the exclusive distribution agreement with the criterion collection 
we also advanced and accrued approximately million in production funding for titles to be released in the future under our feature film co production agreements with dark horse  graymark  amicus and sisters wooster and advanced an additional million during fiscal for content to be released in the future under exclusive license and distribution agreements 
we will be able to recoup these advances against future royalties  distribution fees and profit participations payable 
gross trade receivables decreased over million as a result of increased collection efforts 
we incurred million in capital expenditures in our continuing effort to improve our information technology infrastructure 
we fully repaid our subordinated note payable to ritek and our capital lease obligations by million during fiscal we financed the august home vision acquisition of million and the above expenditures and repayments of debt from cash flows from operations  cash available on hand and through our revolving line of credit  borrowings under which increased to  at march   down from  at our third quarter ended december   and up from no outstanding borrowings at march  we believe that projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
should we find attractive corporate acquisitions  we may seek additional debt or equity financing in order to fund the transaction  in the form of bank financing  convertible debt  or the issuance of convertible preferred or common stock 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands thereafter total contractual obligations operating lease obligations licensing and exclusive distribution agreements employment agreements total advances and guarantees included in the table above  under licensing and exclusive distribution agreements  are prepaid and thus recoupable against future royalties  distribution fees and profit participations earned by our exclusive program suppliers in connection with revenues generated by those rights 
as we have historically  we expect to fund these commitments through recoupment of existing advances  our existing bank line of credit  and other working capital 
included in the table above under licensing and exclusive distribution agreements are approximately million in royalty  distribution fee and production advances which were accrued as a component of accrued royalty and distribution fee advances in the accompanying balance sheet at march  we do not expect our obligations for property and equipment expenditures  including information technology related expenditures  to exceed million per year 
vendor managed inventory vmi under a vmi system  product suppliers are responsible for monitoring  stocking  and fulfilling directly to individual retail stores and outlets 
larger retailers  who have been transacting business via vmi with the major studios for years  are starting to require smaller independents ie product suppliers other than major studios  music labels and mini majors to adopt this method of inventory management 
an existing large retail customer of ours plans to restrict content suppliers from shipping product directly to its stores unless they carry a required minimum number of national titles 
image  along with other independents  has formed a consortium of program suppliers to consolidate shipments in order to satisfy this retailer 
under this arrangement  each member of the consortium retains its existing direct selling and direct billing relationship with this retailer 
our vmi group is currently one of only three independent groups partnering with this retailer 
consortium shipments to this customer will consolidate products from all suppliers in this group  which will result in larger shipments with freight costs shared among the members 
we have fully implemented all of the necessary vmi software and systems  and are currently in the final stages of deploying our vmi program with this customer 
we expect our vmi system to be fully tested and deployed by august  we will evaluate the possibility of deploying our vmi system at other retail customers as opportunities arise 
implementation of vmi requires a capital expenditure of approximately  for initial setup  installation and integration 
in addition  ongoing fees will be paid for software maintenance support  item planning  order management and picking  packing  labeling and shipping of product 
for this initial retail customer  fixed software and services fees and variable inventory handling costs should be partially offset by reduced freight expenses from consolidated shipments 
at this time  we cannot accurately estimate the net increase in expenses as a result of this system 
with respect to long term benefits  we expect the implementation of vmi relationships with retail customers to sell more units and reduce returned items by better matching inventory to real time demand reduce potential overproduction by more accurately forecasting orders reduce processing and warehousing fees by maintaining a leaner supply chain increase our importance as a direct supplier to participating retail partners distribution agreement and related music publishing liability as of march   we have accrued approximately million for mechanical licensing fees for audio programs that we now believe have not been paid by one of our content providers as contractually required 
we have also recorded a corresponding recoupable music publishing advance for these anticipated music publishing payments  included as a component of royalty and distribution fee advances in the accompanying balance sheet  as of march  on february   we entered into an amended agreement with the content provider  which grants us the exclusive right to distribute as many additional content provider branded titles as necessary to fully recoup any outstanding unpaid mechanical licensing and other unrecouped costs 
we will continue to receive our standard distribution fee on all units sold 
the amended agreement gives us the right but not the obligation to discharge any unpaid music publishing fees required 
all related litigation and arbitration proceedings have been dismissed 
we believe we will recover all of the million in advances through profit participations from future titles and future sales of previously released titles from this content provider 
long term debt long term debt at march  and consisted of the following in thousands subordinated note payable ritek taiwan current portion of long term debt long term debt less current portion our subordinated note payable to ritek was fully repaid in accordance with its terms by march  debt instruments and related covenants our loan agreements with wells fargo foothill require us to comply with minimum financial and operating covenants 
on august   the minimum ebitda covenant was revised beginning with the quarter ended june  a provision to the ebitda covenant was also added  such that we may not incur two consecutive fiscal quarters of ebitda losses  beginning with the quarter ending september  on june   at our request  foothill further amended the credit facility to waive our required compliance with the minimum ebitda requirement for the twelve months ended march  reduce the minimum ebitda covenant on a go forward basis 
the required minimum ebitda was amended to million for the twelve months ending june   million for the twelve months ending september  million for the twelve months ending december  and march  and million of each twelve month ended quarterly measurement period thereafter amend the provision that we may not incur two consecutive fiscal quarters of ebitda losses  beginning with the quarter ending september  to also exclude the period ended march  and the period ending june  we were not in compliance with the covenant establishing a minimum ebitda  as defined by foothill  of  for the twelve months ended march  our ebitda  as defined by foothill  was  or  short of the required minimum 
at our request  foothill has waived this minimum ebitda requirement for the month measurement period ended march  and reduced the ebitda covenant minimums on a go forward basis 
we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants at march   and expect to be in compliance with all covenants for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that involve significant uncertainties  require judgments or estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  or that may produce materially different results when using different assumptions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon meeting the recognition requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from home video distribution are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns  as well as related costs  in the period in which the product is available for sale by our customers at the point that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is generally upon receipt by the customer  and in the case of new releases  after street date restrictions lapse 
we recognize revenues from domestic and international broadcast licensing and home video sublicensing  as well as associated costs  when the titles are available to the licensee and other recognition requirements of sop are met 
we defer fees received in advance of availability  usually in the case of advances received from sony bmg  digital site  warner music group and other international home video sublicensees  and for broadcast  until other revenue recognition requirements have been satisfied 
provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided at the time of sale 
as of march   deferred revenue totaled  up from  at march  royalty and distribution fees for each reporting period  we estimate the ultimate total revenues to be received throughout a title s exclusive license or distribution period from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while we charge royalty and distribution fee advances to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenues are important in determining whether we should record additional royalty and distribution fee expense as cost of sales in any given reporting period 
we amortize royalty and distribution fee advances to expense in the same ratio that the current period revenues for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenues for that title 
additionally  in circumstances required by sop  we recognize additional amortization to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
we base our estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title  similar titles and specific genre performance 
we attempt to reflect in our estimates the most current available information on the title 
we update such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s revenue performance 
estimates of ultimate revenues on a title by title basis are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting future actual performance include focus from the sales and marketing department including advertising  promotions and price reductions  availability of retail shelf space  retail customer product placement and advertising  maintenance of adequate inventory levels  concert touring by the artist in the case of music related dvds and cds  retail sell through  and ultimately continued end user consumer demand 
any of the above factors can contribute to a title s actual performance exceeding our expectations prior to release or failure to meet pre release expectations 
overestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized at a slower rate or a delay in adjusting costs to their fair value until such time estimates are reduced  causing unamortized costs to be overstated and increased amortization of costs in a later period 
underestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized more quickly until ultimate revenue estimates are increased  causing unamortized costs to be understated and decreased amortization of costs in a later period 
inventory valuation for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by title  format and genre  and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write down inventories that are considered obsolete or overstocked 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value  and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
future demand will be dependent upon the continued retail customer acceptance of our content  future demand by end user consumer  advertising  promotions and price reductions  market conditions either favorable or unfavorable and future warehouse storage limitations 
should projections of future inventory demand be overstated  the value of inventory would be overstated and current cost of sales understated  with future cost of sales overstated 
conversely  should projections of future demand be understated  the value of inventory would be understated and the current cost of sales overstated  with future cost of sales understated 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable for each reporting period  we evaluate product sales and accounts receivable to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns  sales allowances and other credits given and delinquent accounts 
our estimates of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected require the exercise of judgment and affect reported revenues and net earnings 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  we analyze historical returns quantity of returns and time to receive returned product  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  including reorder activity 
based on this information  we reserve a percentage of each dollar of product sales where the customer has the right to return such product and receive a credit memo 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
estimates of future sales returns and other credits are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting actual returns include retailer financial difficulties  the perception of comparatively poor retail performance in one or several retailer locations  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  inadequate advertising or promotions  retail prices being too high for the perceived quality of the content or other comparable content  the near term release of similar titles  and poor responses to package designs 
underestimation of product sales returns and other credits would result in an overstatement of current revenues and lower revenues in future periods 
conversely  overestimation of product sales returns would result in an understatement of current revenues and higher revenues in future periods 
similarly  we evaluate accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on this information  we reserve an amount that we believe to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions were to worsen  additional allowances might be required in the future 
underestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be overstated and current period expenses to be understated 
overestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be understated and current period expenses to be overstated 
valuation of deferred income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year 
establishment of valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets 
we have a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which are composed primarily of net operating loss nol carry forwards  resulting in income tax expense of  for the year ended march  even though we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable should we have future earnings 
to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carry forwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carry forward periods 
as of march   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes of  and  respectively  which are available to offset taxable income through and  respectively 
although we had a pretax loss of less than  for fiscal and pretax earnings of  for fiscal  we do not possess a strong earnings history 
we enjoyed the benefits of a strong schedule of new dvd and cd releases during fiscal in light of the extremely strong retail success of a relatively few individual titles  we cannot provide assurances that our fiscal dvd and cd new releases will perform as well as  or better than  our fiscal and releases 
results of operations net revenues approximately of consolidated net revenues were generated from our worldwide sale of dvds during fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
cds contributed approximately of consolidated net revenues for fiscal  compared to and of fiscal and  respectively 
the following table presents consolidated net revenues by reportable business segment for the fiscal years ended march change change in thousands in thousands net revenues domestic international consolidated fiscal compared to and domestic revenue net revenues were down primarily due to weakness in the retail dvd marketplace during the first six months of our fiscal year coupled with fewer fiscal breakout dvd new releases 
we began fiscal having to compete with our record revenue performance in fiscal in fiscal  we benefited from new releases of stand up comedy shows we produced featuring blue collar comedians larry the cable guy  ron white and bill engvall  and a combined two titles in one dvd from a fourth blue collar comedian  jeff foxworthy 
these four then new release titles generated over million in net sales during fiscal compared to million generated as catalogue titles in fiscal our then perennial best selling music dvd catalogue title eagles hell freezes over  to which our rights expired in june  contributed million in net revenues in fiscal but only minimal revenues in fiscal we were able to make up much of this deficit in fiscal though increased revenues associated with our acquisition of home vision in august and some higher performing new releases during the fiscal year 
through the home vision acquisition  we acquired the exclusive rights to the bbc production of cs lewis classic books the chronicles of narnia which contributed over million for fiscal the criterion collection contributed million to fiscal net revenues  a increase over fiscal the criterion collection net revenue performance during the last eight months of fiscal  starting from the august effective date of our exclusive distribution agreement with them  is up compared to the same time period in the prior year when distribution was shared with home vision 
net revenues generated from the criterion collection were million for the eight months ended march   up from million for the same period in the prior year 
in february  walt disney pictures and walden media announced that they will release the chronicles of narnia prince caspian as the next theatrical installment of the narnia chronicles 
this should bode well for us as our chronicles box set includes the bbc production of prince caspian 
criterion s new release schedule for fiscal should be strong and we expect continued strong performance from their catalog of previously released dvd programming 
our cd revenues were down  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  due to weaker performance of our catalogue cd titles  especially during the first six months of the fiscal year 
cd revenues were million for fiscal our audio department plans to focus specific attention during fiscal on setting up catalogue promotions to stimulate retailer demand for our audio titles in hopes of reversing this trend with retail 
our top ten new release dvd and cd titles contributed approximately  and of domestic net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
included in the top ten new release titles for fiscal were both the dvd and cd releases of ron white you can t fix stupid  chicago and earth wind fire live at the greek dvd  kiss rock the nation live dvd  the original twilight zone tv series seasons  and dvd  the source presents hip hop hits vol 
cd  beef dvd and mint condition livin the luxury brown cd 
our inventory returns  as a percentage of our gross distribution revenues  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we are selling more programming to larger retailers  who tend to return a higher percentage of their purchases  both to us and to the major studios 
many of these retailers have chosen not to process their own store returns at their own distribution center level  but instead return them to their vendors  including us  for credit 
a retailer may return a title from one store while ordering the same title for another store 
we have increased our allowances for sales returns in expectation of this trend continuing for the foreseeable future 
we have also provided increased market development funds to our customers for which are taken as a credit against revenues and are recorded by us as a reduction in revenues 
these market development fund expenditures totaled   and  or  and of net domestic revenues  before reduction for such market development funds  for fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenue our internationally generated revenues have significantly decreased over the last several years due to lower royalty revenues reported by our international sublicensees 
because of language barriers and cultural differences  much of our successful new release programming particularly urban and comedy titles has not been released internationally or has not sold as well as in north america 
only our high profile non urban music event dvd programming is performing well overseas 
our international revenues for fiscal were negatively affected by the loss of our then perennial best selling international title eagles hell freezes over as of june  our international net revenues from the sale of our eagles titles during fiscal were  or of international net revenues 
we believe internal restructuring at sony bmg associated with their merger in and management reshuffling in early had a negative impact on the sales performance of our titles in europe  the middle east and africa during the last half of fiscal and throughout fiscal we continue our efforts to acquire programming that sells well not only domestically  but also internationally 
music related dvds have done well internationally and we believe the urban music and documentary genres have revenue growth potential overseas 
our uk office  while primarily acquiring content for north american distribution  is also beginning to seek worldwide exclusive distribution rights 
broadcast sales increased to  for fiscal  up from  for fiscal and down from  for fiscal cost of sales the following table presents consolidated cost of sales by reportable business segment and as a percentage of related segment net revenues for the fiscal years ended march in thousands in thousands cost of sales domestic international consolidated change change as a percentage of segment net revenues domestic international consolidated we are now classifying production cost amortization as a component of cost of sales and therefore a reduction to gross profit margins for all periods presented 
we previously reported amortization of production costs as a separate line item within operating costs and expenses 
because we disclose programming production costs as a component of inventory  we believe classification of the related expense of such costs as a component of cost of sales is more meaningful 
amortization of domestic and international non recoupable production costs  as a percentage of net revenues  for the three years ended march   were  and  respectively 
fiscal compared to domestic gross margins domestic gross margins  as a percentage of segment net revenues  decreased by to for fiscal  from for fiscal and from for fiscal the decrease in segment gross profit margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to multiple factors we experienced a significant increase in net revenues generated by the criterion collection dvds for fiscal criterion contributed approximately of fiscal domestic net revenues  significantly up from approximately for fiscal we recognize a gross margin of approximately on criterion net revenues  bringing down the average gross margin on fiscal net sales 
we increased the amount of market development funds provided to our customers  which is recorded as a reduction of revenues and thus has a negative effect on gross margins 
these market development fund expenditures  as percentages of domestic net revenues  were and  before reduction for such market development funds  for fiscal and  respectively 
we expect the trend of increasing market development funds paid to customers to continue for the foreseeable future 
we increased the comparable fair value write downs of royalty and distribution fee advances as a result of lower ultimate revenue forecasts for some of our exclusive programming in accordance with sop by  for fiscal over we amortized approximately  of the million fee resulting from the new criterion exclusive distribution agreement 
we increased the comparable write down to the lower of cost or market value for inventories by  for fiscal over amortization of non recoupable production costs increased by  for over as a result of incremental amortization of titles acquired in the home vision acquisition as well as increased amortization of costs associated with titles produced in the umd format  which we believe has a short product life cycle 
during the fourth quarter we reversed an overaccrual of music publishing liabilities on a dvd series  partially offsetting the decline in gross margins 
during the fourth quarter we were notified by a content holder that the actual negotiated music publishing rate for dvd titles licensed from this content supplier was lower than the estimated rate at which we accrued 
without the actual rate known at the time of release of the related dvds  we accrue music publishing liability at an estimated maximum rate as we sell the programs 
accordingly  we reversed approximately  in accrued music publishing as a credit to cost of sales during the fourth quarter to reflect the comparably lower actual negotiated music publishing rate 
fiscal compared to the increase in segment gross profit margins for fiscal was primarily due to increased net revenues from sales of exclusively licensed programming  which typically generates higher gross margins than exclusively distributed programming 
offsetting the increase in domestic gross margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal were increases in market development funds offered to our retail customers 
these market development fund expenditures were and of net domestic revenues  before reduction for such market development funds  for fiscal and  respectively 
international gross margins gross margins for the international segment are based upon royalty income generated by sales of our exclusive programming by our sublicensees 
the gross margins we report will fluctuate depending upon the sales mix of titles sold by our sublicensees  the sales programs they have in place during the period  and royalty rates to our content suppliers based upon those reported royalties 
we expect gross margins for this segment to continue to fluctuate higher and lower in future periods as a result of the factors mentioned above 
selling expenses the following tables present consolidated selling expenses by reportable business segment and as a percentage of related segment net revenues for the fiscal years ended march change change in thousands in thousands selling expenses domestic international consolidated as a percentage of segment net revenues domestic international consolidated fiscal compared to and domestic selling expenses domestic selling expenses for fiscal reflect a continuing trend of higher advertising expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
we incurred a  increase in expenses for television and radio advertising as well as a  increase in co operative advertising expenses 
we saved  by switching to internet delivery of sell sheets instead of paper sell sheets delivered via mail 
we also reduced our print advertising by  personnel costs  including wages  benefits and internal sales commissions  were up  for fiscal over fiscal due to added sales personnel and annual raises 
egami selling expenses were  for fiscal  its first full year of operation  composed primarily of personnel costs 
print  television  radio and co operative advertising increased  and special event audio and video promotions and publicity consultant expense increased  for fiscal as compared to the prior year 
personnel costs  including wages  benefits and sales commissions  were up  for fiscal over fiscal due to added sales personnel and annual raises 
sales commissions paid to outside consultants increased by  for fiscal  primarily as a result of a significant increase in fiscal sales to target 
rent expense allocated to the domestic selling department in excess of fiscal was  lastly  travel and entertainment expenses were higher by  over that of fiscal print  television  radio and cooperative advertising  audio and in store promotions are increasingly important to our retail customers and influence the size and breadth of their initial orders for our titles 
the likelihood of our larger retailers placing an order for our dvd and cd titles in a significant quantity is enhanced with a convincing outlay of marketing funds to increase product awareness and sales to the end consumer 
it is common and increasingly necessary to spend from seventy cents to in excess of one dollar per unit in order to effectively promote the availability of a higher profile title at retail 
we spent approximately  or of net revenues   or of net revenues and  or of net revenues  for title promotion and advertising in fiscal   and  respectively  almost entirely for domestic wholesale distribution 
in fiscal  we significantly expanded our sales and marketing department personnel infrastructure in certain key areas in an effort to increase sales opportunities with wal mart specific focus on catalogue product promotion and sales specifically product in release over one year face to face sales coverage of key national customers marketing and sales efforts to grow our audio only brands marketing and sales efforts to grow our feature film genre  specifically rental customer sales sales of urban and latin content sales administration for the above initiatives international selling expenses our international selling expenses reflect increased international promotion of our titles 
fiscal segment selling expenses were significantly lower than fiscal because sony bmg  digital site and warner music group  our primary international sublicensees  are responsible for the majority of selling expenses relating to sales of our programming internationally 
our segment expenses for the fiscal period reflect a full period of sony bmg sales and marketing responsibility  whereas fiscal did not 
general and administrative expenses the following tables present consolidated general and administrative expenses by reportable business segment and as a percentage of related segment net revenues for the fiscal years ended march change change in thousands in thousands general and administrative expenses domestic international consolidated as a percentage of segment net revenues domestic international consolidated fiscal compared to and domestic general and administrative expenses in our third quarter we incurred a bad debt charge of million as a result of the january   bankruptcy filing of musicland 
we also incurred an impairment charge for the cumulative cost of a third party software program totaling  we also incurred increases in legal expenses of  with approximately  relating to the lions gate legal matter and incurred increased personnel costs of  due to additional personnel and annual raises 
additionally  the general and administrative expenses of egami and image uk totaled  and  respectively  for fiscal  their first full year of operation 
expenses for egami are primarily personnel and expenses for image uk are primarily personnel and rent and utilities associated with the leased office space 
the overall increased expenses were offset  in part  by reduced expenses of  for consulting and professional services in connection with information technology systems and accounting  net of increased investment banking fees and reduced expenses of  due to the lack of performance based bonuses for fiscal the musicland charge reflects the net expense after reversing royalties and distribution fees otherwise payable by us had we collected the musicland trade receivable 
we have written off as uncollectible the entire musicland trade receivables balance at march  the bad debt charge represents 
per diluted share for fiscal for fiscal  musicland accounted for less than of our net revenues 
we believe the bankruptcy will continue to negatively impact our short term revenues  but we also believe the bankruptcy should not have a long term negative effect on our revenues as we expect traditional and online retailers to absorb musicland s share of the dvd and cd market 
trans world music entertainment corporation  a customer of ours  received united states bankruptcy court approval for the asset acquisition of musicland 
it has been reported that trans world retained approximately of musicland s best performing stores and liquidated the remaining stores 
the remaining stores not acquired by trans world of the more than stores that musicland operated were closed through the bankruptcy process 
in fiscal  we accrued performance based bonuses of  compared to none for fiscal rent expense for our then new headquarters in excess of rent for our old headquarters in fiscal was  we incurred increased depreciation expense of  for fiscal  resulting from our increased capital expenditures in the areas of information technology  furniture  leasehold improvements and equipment 
expenditures on information technology and accounting and royalty consulting and temporary support contributed  of the increase in fiscal  primarily attributable to the support of the first and second phases of our oracle implementation implemented in fiscal  and the fiscal implementation of order management software  including accounting and information technology infrastructure support 
lastly  personnel costs were up  for fiscal  largely due to annual raises 
offsetting the fiscal increases were lower legal expenses of  in the prior year we had higher litigation expenses relating to our efforts to protect our rights from infringers 
other income and expenses other income for fiscal was minimal 
other expenses for fiscal consisted primarily of losses on disposal of fixed assets 
other income for fiscal primarily consisted of foreign currency transaction gains and a minority interest in the net loss of aviva 
interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  for fiscal increased to  or of consolidated net revenues  from  or of consolidated net revenues for fiscal the increase was attributable to a higher weighted average interest rate for fiscal interest expense for fiscal was  or of consolidated net revenues 
the decrease in fiscal from was attributable to lower weighted average outstanding debt levels during fiscal compared to fiscal  principally as a result of paying down our revolving credit facility with proceeds from our december private placement 
income taxes we recorded federal and california state alternative minimum tax for fiscal  and we utilized net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable earnings which resulted in a federal and california alternative minimum tax due to limitations on the utilization of these net operating losses 
we also recorded a texas state tax expense for fiscal income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year

requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  be considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
sfas no 
further provides that cumulative losses in recent years are significant pieces of negative evidence to overcome when determining whether it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized in the future by reducing future income taxes payable 
such cumulative losses from prior years must be considered on a pretax consolidated basis from all operations 
in addition to fiscal pretax losses for both continuing and discontinued operations  we also incurred aggregate net pretax losses for fiscal years and accordingly  during fiscal we established a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which were composed primarily of operating loss carry forwards  resulting in a fiscal tax expense of  although in fiscal we had pretax earnings of  we did not possess a strong earnings history 
we enjoyed the benefits of a strong schedule of new dvd and cd releases during fiscal which we rightfully believed that we would be challenged to duplicate or exceed in fiscal we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at march  even though we have fully reserved our net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable  should we have future earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations 
at march   we had outstanding borrowings of  subject to variable interest rates 
we do not use derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure is linked to the prime rate and libor 
we believe that moderate changes in the prime rate or libor would not materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
a increase in the prime rate or libor would increase our annual interest expense by  based on the outstanding variable interest borrowings at march  foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
at march   approximately  of our accounts receivable related to international distribution and were denominated in foreign currencies subject to future foreign exchange rate risk 
we distribute some of our licensed dvd and vhs programming internationally through subdistributors and sublicensees 
additionally  we exploit international broadcast rights to our licensed entertainment programming 
we believe that moderate changes in the foreign exchange rates for those agreements denominated in foreign currencies will not materially affect our operating results or financial condition 
for example  a change in exchange rates would result in an approximate  impact on pretax income loss based upon those outstanding receivables at march  although our sony bmg and digital site sublicense agreements are us dollar denominated  with these parties reporting to us and paying us in us dollars  the underlying sony bmg sales transactions are in euros and the underlying digital site sales transactions are in yen 
should the us dollar strengthen compared to either the euro or the yen  our sublicensees reported royalties to us on a title by title basis and in the aggregate would decline  assuming consistent unit sales  and thus reduce our revenues recognized 
to date  we have not entered into foreign currency exchange contracts
