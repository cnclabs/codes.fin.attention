item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with an overview of our corporate strategy to provide a view of the goals of our business 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
following that  beginning on page  we discuss our results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet financing arrangements 
forward looking statements this portion of our annual report contains forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors  including those factors described in risk factors beginning on page readers should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements  and we assume no obligation to and do not intend to update any forward looking statements 
corporate strategy overview our goal is to be the leading provider of optimization solutions for discrete product development and manufacture in industries that work with complex processes  with a particular focus on companies working with injection molded plastics 
we help companies manufacture less expensive and more reliable products by increasing the effectiveness of their product and mold design process and manufacturing operations as well as improving efficiencies across their entire design through manufacture process 
we believe that our key competitive strength is our extensive domain knowledge in the fields of materials science and characterization  numerical methods and predictive modeling through simulation and analysis  coupled with our expertise in packaging and delivering this knowledge to our customers in easy to use software applications and hardware systems that optimize the manufacture process 
we develop software products internally and through cooperative research relationships with a number of public and private educational and research organizations around the world 
in addition  some of our products are developed by commercial contractors 
because of the strong body of intellectual property and knowledge that we have created over the course of twenty eight years in serving the product design  engineering and manufacturing markets  we have become the leading provider of highly sophisticated predictive software applications for the plastics design  engineering and manufacturing communities 
our growth strategy is derived from these strengths 
we continue to increase the business value of our products for our customers by improving the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release  and developing products addressing specific vertical market needs in each of our target market segments 
in the design phase  for example  we provide applications which address the process of microchip encapsulation  a process which is involved in the manufacture of semiconductors 
in the manufacturing phase  we offer solutions to the die cast market  a conversion process that is similar to the plastics injection molding process 

table of contents expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy 
we believe that the rapidly growing economies in china  india  eastern europe  south america and other developing regions present significant longer term growth opportunities for our business 
our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs 
international development  however  also involves significant costs and challenges  including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive significant revenue in areas where laws regarding intellectual property are not in place or not effectively enforced 
a significant part of our growth strategy is directed toward increasing customer loyalty and further developing opportunities within our large installed customer base 
we receive approximately to of our overall revenues from repeat customers 
we deliver product releases on a regular and timely basis which incorporate significant functionality improvements to ensure that our customers have access to the latest technology developments 
we focus on customer satisfaction through programs aimed at involving our customers in the future direction of our products  enhancing their ease of use and user experience  and providing multiple points of contact within the company to ensure that their needs are met 
our uses of cash include capital expenditures to support our operations and product development  mergers and acquisitions  investments in growth initiatives  and repurchases of our outstanding common stock 
we continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities to the extent they support our strategy and growth objectives 
reporting periods our fiscal year end is june references to  or mean the fiscal year ended june  unless otherwise indicated 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses and the related disclosures 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  asset valuation allowances  acquisition accounting  impairment accounting  income tax accounting  capitalization of software development costs  stock option accounting and restructuring 
management has reviewed these policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
a discussion of the company s analysis of the uncertainties involved in applying these policies at any given time or the variability that is reasonably likely to result from their application over time follows 
see note to our consolidated financials statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for a general discussion of the method of accounting we use to apply these critical accounting policies and other accounting policies that are significant to us 
a 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from three principal sources license fees for packaged software products  product fees for our collaborative production management products  and service fees from maintenance and support contracts  consulting  implementation  training and material testing services 
for revenue derived from license fees for packaged software products and for product fees derived from our collaborative production management products except for hot runner process controllers  we follow american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
for revenue derived from sales of hot runner process controllers  a subset of our collaborative production management products  and other hardware components with insignificant embedded software  we apply the guidance of emerging issues task force 
table of contents eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
the application of all such guidance requires judgment  including whether or not sufficient evidence of a sales arrangement exits  whether or not the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  whether or not legal title has passed to the customer  whether or not all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and whether or not the collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and free of contingencies 
the amount of recognized and unrecognized revenue could be materially impacted by changes in these judgments 
in addition  maintenance and support contracts are often entered into at the same time as the sale of software licenses 
we consider these to be multiple elements of a single arrangement 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue from arrangements like these with one or more elements to be delivered at a future date  when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements  such as implementation and maintenance services  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria has been fulfilled 
the deferred revenue related to these services is then recognized ratably over the related contract period or as the services are performed 
we determine vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value vsoe of undelivered elements based on the prices that are charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
the fair value of maintenance and support services may also be determined based on the price to be paid upon renewal of that service in accordance with the optional renewal terms offered contractually to a customer 
the determination of the existence of multiple elements and the sufficiency of evidence of fair value of those elements involves significant judgment  changes in which could materially impact the amount of recognized and unrecognized revenue 
if sufficient evidence of the fair value of an undelivered element does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized upon delivery of that element or at the time that fair value can be established for the undelivered element 
b 
asset valuation allowances we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing historical bad debts  changes in customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  changes in customer payment patterns and current economic trends 
changes in these factors may materially impact how we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and thus  the amount of earned revenue and income 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
changes in actual demand and market conditions could materially impact our inventory write downs 
we also provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 
we believe that the net deferred tax asset represents its best estimate  based upon the weight of available evidence  of the deferred tax asset that will be realized 
if such evidence were to change  based upon near term operating results and longer term projections  the amount of the valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets may be decreased or increased 
c 
acquisition accounting we allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  if any  at their fair value on the date of acquisition 
in all cases  any excess purchase price over amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
valuation methodologies as well as the determination of subsequent amortization periods involve significant judgments and estimates 
d 
impairment of acquired intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or 
table of contents circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
e 
income tax accounting sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in addition  our effective tax rate estimates may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory tax rate  as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets  changes in tax law and potential acquisitions 
further  our tax rates may fluctuate within a fiscal year  including from quarter to quarter  due to items arising from discrete events  including settlement of tax audits and assessments  acquisitions of other companies  and changes in gaap or other events 
f 
capitalization of software development costs we apply sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which requires that costs associated with the development of computer software and related products be expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility  and capitalized thereafter until commercial release of the software products 
both the assessment of the amount of costs required to be capitalized and the determination of subsequent amortization periods involve significant judgments and estimates 
g 
stock option accounting we apply sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to expense the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors and other forms of stock based compensation 
the impact of expensing employee and director stock awards on our earnings is material and is further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  stock option and incentive plans 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
h 
restructuring from time to time we may record charges resulting from restructuring our operations  including the consolidation of our operations  changes in our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs or other events 
for these charges  we apply sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 costs associated with exit or disposal activities are determined and recognized at their fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date we commit to an exit or disposal plan 
the recognition of these restructuring charges require us to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent our actual 
table of contents restructuring results differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
restructuring charges may include such costs and charges as those related to employee severance  termination benefits  the write off of assets  professional service fees and costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of any estimated income from subleases 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose

typically  our customers pay an up front  one time fee for our products 
for our packaged software applications  the amount of the fee depends upon the number and type of software modules licensed and the number of the customer s employees or other users who can access the software product simultaneously 
for our collaborative product management systems  the amount of the fee depends upon the number and type of software modules licensed with the system  if any  and the system s hardware components 
in addition  we receive royalty payments from developers of other software products related to the bundling of our software with their design software programs 
we record these payments as revenue as well  but such amounts have been immaterial to date 
our total product revenue was million for both fiscal and fiscal the absence of growth in fiscal was partially attributable to the softness in our north american market  in particular in the automotive industry 
compared to the prior year  product revenue derived from our asia australia region for the full fiscal year increased  while our european region increased and our americas region decreased 
for the full year  currency movements had a negative impact on product revenue when compared to fiscal year 
table of contents we added approximately new customers in fiscal  compared to approximately and new customers in and  respectively

design analysis solutions product revenue product revenue from our das products was million in compared to million in and million in we sold seats of das products in fiscal  compared to and seats of these products in and  respectively 
in fiscal  our das product revenue increased by from fiscal product revenue derived from our mpi product line increased from the previous year  a result of increasing sales of those products in the united kingdom  china and taiwan 
we believe the increase in revenue from those countries represents the realization of investments made in the direct sales teams in those geographies in fiscal and partially offsetting the effects of the increased mpi sales was a decline in revenue from our mpa product line  and  to a lesser extent  the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the reduction in mpa revenue compared to the prior year was primarily due to our introduction of new mpa modules in late fiscal and fiscal  which resulted in more add on sales to existing customers in that year compared to that which was experienced in fiscal we continue to develop new markets for our products and add sales representatives to address those markets in growing economic regions of the world  including such places as india and south america 
in fiscal  some of our planned investments in these geographies were slightly delayed  which contributed to the overall decline in product revenue growth rate in compared to the previous fiscal year 
in fiscal  the increase in product revenue from was primarily due to strong sales results in japan  korea and taiwan driven primarily by significant follow on orders from large customers in the electronics sector 
in addition  we experienced overall increased sales into european automotive and electronics industries and also into the us consumer goods and specialty molding industries 
these increases were primarily the result of new product introductions  which included mpa version and mpi version and other software applications designed to expand our product offerings into additional market segments  and  to a lesser extent  a result of continued economic recoveries in certain of our key markets and favorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
manufacturing solutions product revenue product revenue from our ms products was million in  compared to million in and million in we sold  seats of our ms products in fiscal  compared to  and seats of ms products in and  respectively 
the decrease in ms product revenue in was primarily attributable to slower than expected conversion of potential orders into recognizable sales 
we believe these longer sales cycles were a result of increasing complexity in our customers businesses  which delayed capital spending on our products 
in addition  despite selling more seats of our ms products compared to the prior fiscal year  the average selling price of each seat was less than the previous year due to the mix of products sold  which reduced our overall product revenue 
also  during fiscal  we restructured our ms division  which disrupted the normal operations of this business unit and reduced its overall sales productivity 
the actions associated with the restructuring were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in product revenue from fiscal to was due to the acquisition of american msi corporation amsi

services revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  compared to and of our total revenue in and  respectively 
revenue derived from services increased by in fiscal compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily due to increased sales of maintenance contracts related to our das products  especially in asia australia  which was the result of growth in our installed customer base arising from software license sales made during the reporting period and in prior years 
cost and operating expenses effective in fiscal  we adopted sfas no

provision for income taxes we are subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions worldwide with varying statutory rates  and the use of estimates is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  and income taxes  respectively  for further information regarding our income tax accounting and valuation allowance policies 
the american jobs creation act of the ajca was enacted in october the ajca created a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed earnings from their foreign subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain foreign earnings 
the company repatriated million a million of foreign subsidiary earnings from australia to the united states under the provisions of the ajca in fiscal  incurring additional tax expense of  our fiscal tax provision is million on income before tax of million resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately  increasing from an effective tax rate of in fiscal in fiscal  the significant reconciling items between the us federal statutory income tax rate and the effective tax rate included the following  of tax expense related to the company s repatriation of foreign earnings in accordance with the provisions of the ajca mentioned above   of tax expense related to an increase in our valuation allowance 
table of contents and  related to non deductible stock based compensation expenses 
the impact of the above items was partially offset by a  favorable tax rate differential between the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have established a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets  consisting principally of net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences in certain jurisdictions  including the united states 
at june   we had total net deferred tax assets of  which represented the excess of million gross deferred tax assets  over a million valuation allowance and deferred tax liabilities of  we believe that the company will earn sufficient taxable income in the future to realize our net deferred tax assets 
in the first quarter of fiscal  one of the company s australian subsidiaries became subject to an audit by the australian tax office ato 
for the years of  and  the amount of liabilities assessed to date by the ato  including tax penalties and interest  is approximately million a million 
payments of million a million have been made to date with respect to these assessed amounts in order to limit the interest that may accrue on these amounts from the date of assessment through the ultimate resolution of these matters 
these payments have been recorded as current assets as of june  the tax authority has agreed to defer any action to recover the remaining assessed tax amount outstanding and that no portion of the remaining interest and penalty charges need to be paid pending resolution of the dispute 
the liability amount of approximately million a million referred to above represents the company s maximum potential exposure  but does not reflect the potential tax benefits of such payments  which might serve to mitigate the net expense that would be reflected in the company s results of operations 
during fiscal we may continue to make cash payments related to interest that is accruing on the amounts due 
any such payments would be recorded as current assets 
we believe that the positions taken in our tax returns with respect to these matters have merit 
we will continue to take steps to preserve our rights through the ato s objection process and believe that our positions will ultimately be sustained 
accordingly  we have not recorded any liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet related to any amounts of additional tax  penalty or interest that have been assessed to date or that may be assessed by the ato in the future 
because the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain  it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  professional fees related to these matters have been and may continue to be significant 
business combinations we acquired american msi corporation amsi in january the acquisition of amsi provided us advanced hot runner process controller products that assure that materials are kept in an optimal state until injected into the part cavity during the manufacturing process

as of june   we had no outstanding debt 
at june   our marketable securities consisted of corporate bonds with maturities from the date of purchase in excess of three months 
investments in marketable securities are made in accordance with our corporate investment policy 
the primary objective of this policy is the preservation of capital 
investments are limited to high quality corporate debt  government securities  municipal debt securities  money market funds and similar instruments 
the policy establishes maturity limits  liquidity requirements and concentration limits 
at june   we were in compliance with this internal policy 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in and million in the decrease in cash generated from operations in fiscal compared to was primarily the result of payments of million related to obligations arising from our restructuring plans  lower net income and an increase in our inventories  prepaid expenses  and other current assets  which totaled million 
the most significant component of the million was our payment of million dollars of cash to the ato related to audits of the fiscal  and tax years of our australian subsidiary 
these amounts  which were recorded as current assets  were paid to limit interest that may accrue on the amounts in question from the date of assessment through the ultimate resolution of these matters 
in both and  cash was primarily provided by net income as adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense 
investing activities generated million and million of cash in and  respectively  and consumed million of cash in in  sales and maturities of marketable securities generated million of cash  which was partially offset by million of cash invested in marketable securities  million of cash used to acquire fixed assets  and  of costs that were capitalized related to the development of software products 
our financing activities generated cash of  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  million of cash was generated by exercises of stock options and was partially offset by the use of million of cash to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
in fiscal and  this cash was generated by exercises of stock options and proceeds received for common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
on may   our board of directors terminated the september stock repurchase plan  which originally authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common stock  and simultaneously authorized the repurchase of up to  shares under a new stock repurchase plan 
in may and june  pursuant to the plan  the company acquired  shares for million  an average purchase price of per share 
all of these shares remained in treasury as of june  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months following the date of this annual report 
capital expenditure requirements for fiscal are expected to be approximately million  primarily for the purchase of fixed assets 
we also expect to continue to capitalize costs related to our software development activities in an amount greater than or similar to fiscal long term cash requirements  other than normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the continued development of new 
table of contents products  financing anticipated growth and the possible acquisition of businesses  software products or technologies complementary to our business 
on a long term basis or to complete acquisitions in the short term  we may require additional external financing through credit facilities  sales of additional equity or other financing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such financing can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as liabilities at june  payments due by period less more than than total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle  in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly adopted accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s fiscal year 
the company will determine the impact of this standard on its condensed consolidated financial statements when and if an accounting change or error correction occurs

 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas no 

this statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument containing an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  and broadens a qualified special purpose entity s qspe permitted holdings to include passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to other derivative financial instruments 
sfas no

sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing 
table of contents liabilities be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  and permits the entities to elect either fair value measurement with changes in fair value reflected in earnings or the amortization and impairment requirements of sfas no 
for subsequent measurement 
the subsequent measurement of separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value eliminates the necessity for entities that manage the risks inherent in servicing assets and servicing liabilities with derivatives to qualify for hedge accounting treatment and eliminates the characterization of declines in fair value as impairments or direct write downs 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year  provided the entity has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements for any period of that fiscal year

in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
requires recognition of tax benefits that satisfy a greater than probability threshold 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin no

will have on our financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that our revenue and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe that our revenue and results of operations will be significantly impacted by inflation in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop our products in research centers in australia  the united kingdom  france and the united states 
we sell our products globally through our direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  a significant portion of our sales transactions are denominated in foreign currencies  which exposes us to foreign exchange risk 
in addition  we are exposed to other primary market risks  including changes in interest rates and credit risk 
in the future  we expect to increase our international operations in our existing markets and in geographic locations where we do not have any operations now 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign exchange risk we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and our invested cash balances 
at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents invested in foreign currency denominated accounts 
our consolidated cash position will continue to be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use currency options  zero cost collars and other combinations of options that constitute net purchased options to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales and a portion of our foreign currency denominated intercompany research and development payments over a period of up to twelve months to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
however  we cannot be sure that any efforts we make to hedge our exposure to currency exchange rate changes will be successful 
using sensitivity analysis  we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of for all currencies could be experienced over the next fiscal year 
if the change had occurred  it would have resulted in an adverse impact on operating income of approximately million at june   and million at june  the adverse impact at june  and june  is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately million for each 
table of contents year from currency options and collars put in place throughout the year 
the decrease in the amount of adverse impact between fiscal and fiscal is due to a lower foreign currency balance in the euro for fiscal interest rate risk our invested cash balances are subject to interest rate risk and  as a result  changes in interest rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
we invest our excess cash balances in highly liquid  interest bearing instruments  including government and corporate bonds 
at june   the fair value and principal amounts of our marketable securities portfolio amounted to million  with a yield to maturity of 
our investments are limited to high grade corporate debt securities  government issued debt  municipal debt securities  money market funds and similar high quality instruments 
in a declining interest rate environment  we would experience a decrease in interest income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment 
our interest income will continue to fluctuate based upon changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
however  given the relatively short maturities and investment grade quality of our marketable securities portfolio  a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of these instruments 
these instruments potentially expose us to credit risk  however  we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
those guidelines limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
using sensitivity analysis  we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced over the next fiscal year 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have had a material adverse impact on the company in fiscal and fiscal primarily because we do not invest in debt securities with maturities greater than six months 
credit risk our accounts receivable from our customers expose us to credit risk 
we believe that such credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers comprising our accounts receivable and their broad dispersion over geographic regions and industries 
our accounts receivable carrying values approximate their fair value
