all subsequent written or oral forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
the following should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
executive summary we are one of the oldest mutual fund and asset management firms in the country  with expertise in a broad range of investment styles and across a variety of market environments 
one of our distinctive qualities is that we are a significant distributor of investment products  conducting our business in two channels the advisors channel and the wholesale channel 
in the advisors channel  we have a network of over  financial advisors providing personal financial planning services to our clients across the united states focusing on investment strategies for retirement  education funding  insurance  estate planning and other specific needs 
in our wholesale channel  we distribute the ivy funds through a national wholesale effort to broker dealer  registered investment advisor and k retirement channels 
we also distribute products in the wholesale channel through institutional  strategic partnerships and through legend  our florida based retirement planning subsidiary 
our earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent on financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly united states equity markets  can have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we derive our revenues primarily from providing investment management  distribution and administrative services to the funds and institutional and separately managed accounts 
investment management fees  a substantial source of revenues  are based on the amount of average assets under management and are affected by sales levels  financial market conditions  redemptions and the composition of assets 
underwriting and distribution revenues  another substantial source of revenues  consist of commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products  distribution fees on certain variable products  and fees earned on fee based asset allocation products  as well as advisory services 
the products sold have various commission structures and the revenues received from sales of products vary based on the type and amount sold 
rule b service and distribution fees earned for servicing and or distributing certain mutual fund shares are based upon a percentage of assets and fluctuate based on sales  redemptions and financial market conditions 
other service fees include transfer agency fees  custodian fees for retirement plan accounts and portfolio accounting 
we experienced progress and change throughout as we took steps designed to take advantage of opportunities 
the year was marked by the resolution of several legal disputes 
we also focused on building a resolute culture of compliance  putting in place new leadership and ensuring that we conduct our business in accordance with fast changing regulatory standards and that we rise to the highest standards of compliance on behalf of our clients 
while financial markets faced a number of challenges in  consumers and the economy remained fairly resilient 
whatever the short term challenges and external factors  we believe that  over time  our consistent and disciplined investment management style will bring strong results to investors 
that held true in  as our funds performance ranked among the most competitive in the industry 
these results substantiate our belief that our core strength is our investment management team  who average years of industry experience and years of tenure with us 
our fund families cover virtually all major asset classes and range of investment styles 
our investment strategy generally emphasizes investments at attractive valuations in companies that our portfolio managers believe can produce above average growth in earnings 
our portfolio managers also strive for consistent long term performance while seeking to provide downside protection in turbulent markets 
our advisors channel underwent major changes during  as we introduced new management and carried out a number of initiatives designed to address negative net sales trends 
we substantially strengthened the support that our headquarters provides to each division office and  ultimately  to each advisor 
specific steps taken included enhancing product education and financial planning training programs through a dedicated national wholesaling team and providing a full time  in house staff of planning process experts that assist advisors daily 
we were very encouraged by improved sales trends throughout and anticipate even more improvements as we look toward our non proprietary efforts have begun to fulfill our strategic objective of capturing sales in our investment products at a rate far greater than would be possible through distributing them solely through the advisors channel 
sales in the non proprietary segment of our wholesale channel continued to grow in  particularly sales of certain specialty sub advised funds 
sales of sub advised funds generate lower profit margins since a portion of the management fees earned on these assets are paid to a third party sub adviser 
the successful sales growth of sub advised products has allowed us to showcase our own managed products  which have excellent track records 
recent trends show improvement in the percentage of sales of our products managed in house compared to those that are sub advised and we plan to significantly broaden sales into more funds in the coming years 
continued asset growth in the wholesale channel should provide for increased operating leverage  particularly if we are able to maintain redemption levels and fund performance rankings 
key developments leadership changes effective may   keith a 
tucker  the company s chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors resigned after serving nearly years with the company 
consistent with emerging best practices in corporate governance  the company separated the position of chairman of the board of directors from that of the chief executive officer 
the company s president and former chief investment officer  henry j 
herrmann  a year veteran of the company  was named chief executive officer  while the position of independent  non executive chairman of the board of directors was filled by alan w 
kosloff  an independent member of the board of directors 
mr 
tucker will continue to serve the company as a consultant for a period of eight years 
on june   michael l 
avery  a year veteran of our investment management team was appointed chief investment officer 
mr 
avery succeeds mr 
herrmann in leading an investment management team of over professionals  with mr 
herrmann remaining chairman of the investment policy committee 
significant leadership changes in our advisors channel were implemented during the first quarter of thomas w 
butch  senior vice president and chief marketing officer  assumed executive respon sibility for all retail sales  adding to his existing responsibilities for marketing and non proprietary sales 
we also appointed steven e 
anderson as our national sales manager and bradley d 
hofmeister as associate national sales manager 
both individuals served as regional vice presidents and have been with the company for several years 
throughout their careers  each has established a proven track record in sales management 
accelerated vesting of stock options on april   the compensation committee of the board of directors the compensation committee approved the accelerated vesting of all then outstanding unvested stock options previously awarded to employees  financial advisors  officers and directors 
this resulted in the accelerated vesting of options to purchase  shares of common stock of the company 
of these options   were in the money options having an exercise price less than the then current market price of the company s common stock and a weighted average exercise price of per share 
in order to prevent unintended personal benefits to directors and executive officers holding such options  the compensation committee imposed restrictions on any shares received through the exercise of accelerated options held by those individuals 
these restrictions prevent the sale of any stock obtained through exercise of an accelerated option prior to its original vesting date  other than the disposition of stock as payment for the exercise price of options and associated income taxes  if any 
the compensation committee approved the accelerated vesting of these options based on the belief that it was in the best interest of the stockholders to reduce future compensation expense that the company would otherwise be required to report in its statement of operations upon adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of subsequent to the compensation committee s decision to accelerate the vesting of these options  the separation from employment of our former chief executive officer triggered the remeasurement of compensation cost  and as a result  we incurred additional compensation expense of million during we anticipate that all other holders of in the money accelerated options will remain employed with the company throughout the original vesting term of such options  and therefore  no expense will be recorded for these options unless option holders are able to exercise an option that would have expired unexercisable pursuant to its original terms 
change in method of reporting for rule b service fees we collect rule b service and distribution fees pursuant to sales and servicing plan agreements compensatory and or reimbursement with the funds  primarily from the advisors funds class a reimbursement plan 
these plans allows for reimbursement to us of certain rule b eligible expenses  not to exceed a maximum of basis points of average daily net assets under management 
rule b service and distribution fees are collected for costs related to the servicing and distribution of mutual fund shares such as sales commissions paid to financial advisors  advertising  sales brochures and costs for providing ongoing services to mutual fund shareholders 
effective in the second quarter of  we changed our method of reporting rule b service fee revenue to the gross basis of presentation 
previously  we used the net basis of presentation  whereby such service fee revenue was recorded as an offset against related underwriting and distribution expenses and presented as a reduction of expenses in underwriting and distribution expenses 
we believe that with this change  our presentation reflects the predominant industry practice for reporting rule b service fee revenues and expenses 
the revised presentation had no effect on gross margin dollars  net income  cash flows  working capital or stockholders equity amounts previously reported  and will not affect such amounts in future periods 
results of operations net income net income decreased in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for the same period in the decrease can be attributed to current year legal and regulatory settlements of million and million in costs related to the separation of employment of our former chief executive officer and severance and restructuring costs in our advisors channel 
net income in fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for the same period in the increase in net income of approximately million was primarily a result of charges of million recorded during related to a tender offer for out of the money employee stock options and million recorded for various legal matters

revenues from the management of institutional and separate accounts make up the remaining components of management fee revenue 
during  revenues from the management of fund assets increased million  or  to million as average mutual fund assets under management increased to billion 
during  revenues increased million  or  to million as average assets under management increased to billion 
during  higher management fee rates were earned because of increased assets under management in the ivy funds portfolios  which typically carry higher fees due to scale 
during  we observed a shift in the composition of our assets under management  moving away from fixed income funds toward equity funds  which generally carry a higher management fee rate 
the increases in average assets under management during and can be primarily attributed to appreciation in fund assets 
the acquisition of billion in assets from securian in the latter part of also contributed to an increase in average assets during revenues from investment advisory services for institutional and separate accounts were million in both and overall growth in assets under management during was constrained by the loss of one block of client assets moving to an index fund  which was unrelated to performance or service issues  and also performance driven outflows at acf  resulting in a decline in acf s average assets under management of during the year 
revenues increased to million during compared to due mainly to market appreciation in assets from institutional and separate accounts 
institutional and separate account business growth is sporadic by nature and assets are typically obtained in large blocks but less frequently when compared to our retail mutual fund business 
the long term redemption rate  which includes our funds and institutional and separate accounts  but excludes money market funds  was  a decrease compared to last year s rate of 
we also track the redemption rate by our two distribution channels 
the advisors channel long term redemption rate improved to compared to during the long term redemption rate in the non proprietary segment of our wholesale channel decreased from in to in we expect the advisors channel long term redemption rate to remain lower than that of the wholesale channel due to the personal and customized nature in which our financial advisors provide service to their clients 
underwriting and distribution revenues and expenses the advisors channel is the primary source of underwriting and distribution revenue  given that a significant amount of wholesale mutual fund sales are load waived  with the exception of investment product sales by legend retirement advisors 
the majority of underwriting and distribution fee revenues are derived from sales commissions charged on front end load products sold by our financial advisors that include mutual fund class a shares those sponsored by the company and those underwritten by other non proprietary mutual fund companies  variable annuities and financial planning fees 
to a lesser extent  underwriting and distribution revenues are received from rule b asset based distribution and service fees earned on both load and deferred load products sold by our financial advisors and third party intermediaries  asset based fees earned on our asset allocation products  and commissions earned on the sale of other insurance products 
we divide the costs of underwriting and distribution into two components direct costs and indirect costs 
direct selling costs fluctuate with sales volume  such as advisor commissions and commission overrides paid to field management  advisor incentive compensation  commissions paid to third parties and those paid to our own wholesalers  and related overrides in our wholesale channel 
indirect selling costs are discretionary costs that do not necessarily fluctuate with sales levels 
indirect costs include expenses incurred by our home office and field offices such as wholesaler salaries  marketing costs  promotion and distribution of our products through the advisors and wholesale channels  support and management of our financial advisors such as field office overhead  sales programs  technology infrastructure  and costs of managing and supporting our wholesale efforts through technology infrastructure and personnel 
we recover certain of our underwriting and distribution costs through rule b service and distribution fees  which are paid by the funds 
rule b service and distribution fees are received predominantly from the advisors funds class a shares under a sales and servicing reimbursement plan agreement 
this agreement allows reimbursement to us from the advisors funds class a shares of certain rule b eligible expenses  not to exceed a maximum of basis points of average daily net assets under management 
we also have compensatory or reimbursement rule b service and or distribution plans for the ivy funds  target funds  invested  and advisor funds 
all b service and distribution fee revenue received from the funds is recorded on a gross basis

we intend to continue our focus on ways to create meaningful sales improvement in the advisors channel in long term redemption rates for the advisors channel were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  well below the industry average for redemptions

in  a full year of costs associated with marketing and distributing the ivy funds  including sales brochures  prospectuses and other publicity  training for wholesalers  business meetings and travel expenses  systems support  and the addition of employees  including internal and external wholesalers and support staff  collectively contributed almost entirely to the increase in indirect expenses

these sub advisory relationships were in place when we acquired certain businesses  and are with asset managers who specialize in some investment styles not offered by the company 
sub advisory expenses for the years ended  and were million  million and million  respectively 
significant sales growth in our wholesale channel throughout and  particularly sales of two of our sub advised specialty mutual fund products  has driven increased expenses 
as this expense is a function of sales  redemptions and market action for sub advised assets  a continuation of the growth trend for these assets would likely result in future increases to sub advisory expenses 
other income and expenses investment and other income investment and other income for increased by million over the same period in the prior year  primarily reflecting increased interest on short term commercial paper investments of million due to a combination of a higher balances and interest rates

investment income in included a gain of million from the sale of mutual funds  net of other investment losses 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  to million for compared to  primarily reflecting an increase of million from interest paid on our senior notes due to higher variable rates paid on our interest rate swap 
average interest rates on these senior notes rose from in to during this increase was offset by a decrease in interest paid on short term money market loans of million due to a decline in average borrowings for the year 
on january   we issued million in principal amount senior notes due we expect our effective interest rate on the new notes to be approximately  which includes the impact of underwriting discounts  deferred gains on hedge transactions associated the issuance of the notes  and other transaction costs 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for compared to this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in interest recorded on long term debt due to an increase in variable interest rates paid on the interest rate swap during the compared to average borrowings and rates on money market loans were also higher during  resulting in a increase in interest expense compared to income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and  in  and  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounting for intangible assets and goodwill as of december   our total intangible assets and goodwill was million  or  of our total assets 
two significant considerations arise with respect to these assets that require management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation of impairment 
in connection with all of our acquisitions  an evaluation is completed to determine reasonable purchase price allocations 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgments as to expectations for the various products  distribution channels  and business strategies 
for example  certain growth rates and operating margins were assumed for different products and distribution channels 
if actual growth rates or operating margins  among other assumptions  differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could be subject to charges for impairment in the future 
we complete an ongoing review of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets using a fair value based approach on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
intangible assets with indefinite lives  primarily acquired mutual fund advisory contracts  are tested for impairment annually by comparing their fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
we consider mutual fund advisory contracts indefinite lived intangible assets as they are expected to be renewed without significant cost or modification of terms 
factors that are considered important in determining whether an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets might exist include significant continued underperformance compared to peers  the likelihood of termination or non renewal of a mutual fund advisory or sub advisory contract or substantial changes in revenues earned from such contracts  significant changes in our business and products  material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends  or other factors specific to each asset or subsidiary being evaluated 
because of the significance of goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated balance sheets  the annual impairment analysis is critical 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of taxable income for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  including the determination of any valuation allowances that might be required for deferred tax assets 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of the current reporting period based on our belief that operating income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trend of positive operating income changes  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
pensions and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement employee benefits costs opeb and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we use certain assumptions including  but not limited to  the selection of i the discount rate used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  ii the expected return on plan assets  and iii the expected health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year 
the expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected future market conditions 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates  future pension costs and funding requirements may change materially 
the effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the company s retirement benefit plans would be as follows in thousands of dollars december  december  assumptions change increase decrease pbo apbo increase decrease expense in thousands  except percentage data pension discount rate bps expected return on assets bps opeb discount rate bps health care cost trend rate bps projected benefit obligation pbo for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo for opeb plans 
pre tax impact on service cost  interest cost and amortization of gains or losses 
deferred sales commissions we pay upfront sales commissions to our financial advisors and third party intermediary broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of mutual fund shares sold without a front end sales charge 
these costs are capitalized and amortized over the period during which the shareholder is subject to a cdsc  not to exceed five years 
we recover these costs through rule b distribution plan payments fees  which are paid by the applicable share classes of the advisors funds  ivy funds and invested portfolios  along with cdsc s paid by shareholders who redeem their shares prior to completion of the required holding periods 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and cdsc  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we periodically review the recoverability of deferred sales commission assets as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of deferred sales commission assets may not be recoverable and adjust the deferred assets accordingly 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of the other than temporary decline in the value of our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies the likelihood that a loss contingency exists is evaluated using the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
through consultation with legal counsel 
a loss contingency is recorded if the contingency is considered probable and reasonably estimable as of the date of the financial statements 
in addition  it is the company s policy to record legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency net of insurance recoveries 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  revised sfas r 
sfas r requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  normally the vesting period 
this revised statement allows entities to restate previously issued financial statements or adopt the provisions on a prospective basis 
if restatement is chosen  the expense shown for prior periods will be the same amounts previously calculated and reported in their pro forma disclosures that had been required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we have continued to apply the accounting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for our stock based compensation plans until the effective date of sfas r 
had we implemented the provisions of sfas no 
r our diluted earnings per share would have been reduced to and for fiscal and  respectively 
on march   the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payments sab  which expresses the staff s views regarding the application of sfas r 
the impact of sab and the adoption of sfas r cannot be accurately estimated at this time  as it is dependent on the amount of share based awards in future periods 
however  had the company adopted sfas r and implemented sab in a prior period  the impact would approximate the pro forma impact to net income and earnings per share under sfas s fair value method of accounting for employee stock plans as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires that tax benefits received in excess of amounts attributable to compensation cost recognized in the financial statements be reclassified from an operating cash flow to a financing cash flow in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
this change in classification will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle  unless impracticable  in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the statement provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable 
the statement also addresses the reporting of a correction of error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
seasonality and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations  however  we have historically experienced increased sales activity in the first and fourth quarters of the year due to funding of retirement accounts by our clients 
the company has not suffered material adverse affects from inflation in the past 
however  a substantial increase in the inflation rate in the future may adversely affect customers purchasing decisions  may increase the costs of borrowing  or may have an impact on the company s margins and overall cost structure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments with certain inherent market risks  primarily related to interest rates and securities prices 
the principal risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed relate to interest rates on debt and marketable securities 
generally  these instruments have not been entered into for trading purposes 
management actively monitors these risk exposures  however  fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
as a matter of policy  we only execute derivative transactions to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for speculative or trading purposes 
the following information  together with information included in other parts of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which are incorporated herein by reference  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to us 
interest rate sensitivity our interest sensitive liabilities include our long term fixed rate senior notes and obligations for any balances outstanding under our credit facility or other short term borrowings 
increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decrease in the fair value of the senior notes and an increase in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
decreases in market interest rates would generally cause an increase in the fair value of the senior notes and a decrease in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
we had no short term borrowings outstanding as of december  on january   we issued million in principal amount of fixed rate senior notes due proceeds from the new senior notes were used to pay down our million in senior notes which matured on january  on march   our million fixed rate senior notes maturing in january the notes were effectively converted to variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we agreed with another party to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and various floating rate interest amounts  calculated using a notional amount of million 
the difference in the floating rate interest paid and the fixed rate interest received is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense during the period that the related debt is outstanding 
as of december   the floating rate being paid was 
the average floating rate paid on the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet by adjusting the carrying amounts of the notes by an offsetting amount for the swap 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas we account for the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the notes 
this interest rate swap is considered effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the notes arising from changes in interest rates  and accordingly  there has been no impact on earnings resulting from any ineffectiveness associated with this transaction 
as of december   the company recorded an increase to other assets of million to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap and an increase to long term debt of million to reflect the fair value of the notes 
no fair value adjustment was necessary for the swap at the end of during  the company entered into two forward starting interest rate swap agreements that had five year fixed swap rates of and  respectively  on notional amounts of million for each swap 
the swaps were put in place to hedge against changes in forecasted interest payments attributable to changes in the libor swap rate between the time we entered into the swap agreement and the time we anticipated refinancing the notes in january we assessed the effectiveness of the swaps as hedges at their inception and at december   and we consider these swaps to be completely effective cash flow hedges under sfas as of december   net unrealized gains attributed to the forward swap cash flow hedges were approximately million and were included as a component of other comprehensive income 
on january   the company terminated these forward interest rate swap agreements upon the completion of its new offering in january of million in principal amount senior notes due january in connection with the termination of the swap agreements  the company received a net cash settlement of million 
the company s gain on this transaction will be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized into earnings as a decrease to interest expense over the five year term of the new notes 
available for sale investments sensitivity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade debt securities and equity mutual funds 
a substantial portion of investments are classified as available for sale investments 
at any time  a sharp increase in interest rates or a sharp decline in the united states stock market could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary by management  the cost basis of the individual security or mutual fund is written down to fair value 
conversely  declines in interest rates or a significant rise in the united states stock market could have a material positive impact on our investment portfolio 
however  unrealized gains are not recognized on available for sale securities until they are sold 
we do not currently hedge these exposures 
securities price sensitivity our revenues are dependent on the underlying assets under management in the funds to which investment advisory services are provided 
the funds include portfolios of investments comprised of various combinations of equity  bond and other types of securities 
fluctuations in the value of these securities are common and are generated by numerous factors  including  without limitation  market volatility  the overall economy  inflation  changes in investor strategies  availability of alternative investment vehicles  government regulations and others 
accordingly  declines in any one or a combination of these factors  or other factors not separately identified  may reduce the value of investment securities and  in turn  the underlying assets under management on which our revenues are earned 
these declines have an impact in our investment sales  thereby compounding the impact on our earnings
