item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company designs  manufactures  and markets institutional furniture 
the company s current product lines consist of multipurpose room furniture and healthcare seating 
in addition  the company continues to pursue development of new products and the acquisitions of product lines or companies that will be complementary to the company s businesses 
multipurpose room furniture 
the company s multipurpose room furniture line consists of lightweight  durable  folding leg tables  stacking and folding chairs  lecterns  portable partitions  and other related products 
these products are used in multipurpose rooms of educational  recreational  hotel and hospitality  government  office  healthcare  religious and other public assembly facilities 
historically  growth in this segment has come from an expanding base of new customers  from increasing sales to existing customers and from expansion of the company s multipurpose room product line 
the current and future growth of the company s multipurpose room furniture operations is largely dependent upon its ability to successfully introduce and market new product lines of multipurpose room furniture and its ability to profitably increase its market penetration into existing and new markets 
multipurpose room furniture outlook 
after three years of declines in the institutional furniture marketplace due to the downturn in the domestic and international economy  the institutional furniture marketplace started to grow again in calendar year this accelerated in calendar year and has continued so far in for the company s fiscal year ending march   the company experienced growth of percent in its multipurpose room furniture segment which was slightly higher than the industry growth during the same time period of percent 
for the current calendar year  industry analysts are estimating that shipments will slow down from the fast pace of the prior year and are estimating growth for the year of percent for calendar year as compared to calendar year the company is encouraged by these forecasts as well as the strengthening of the economy in general  and is cautiously optimistic that the industry will continue its rebound and that the company s multipurpose room sales volumes will likewise continue to grow 
in january  the company announced its intention to cut off funding on its current next generation table 
the company had been working on developing a table with improved performance characteristics than its existing table 
with the decision to discontinue funding on the new table  the company has refocused its efforts on the existing table to enhance its performance as well as attempt to further drive down costs 
the company is also focused on increasing its chair offering and has added four new chair lines during the last fiscal year 
the company is also pursuing uses for the rotational molding facility built for production of the new table 
the company has started using the facility for the manufacture of fence panels and posts  which are outside of its current institutional furniture market 
the company is encouraged by the response from customers who have purchased the product  as well as the response from potential customers who have viewed and handled the product 
the company plans to continue building its capacity and refining its manufacturing techniques as it breaks into this marketplace and is hopeful that fencing will contribute to its sales growth in the upcoming year 
however  the company cannot guarantee that it will be successful in marketing these fencing products or in utilizing its existing capacity 
during the past few years  chair sales have begun to make up a larger portion of the sales of the company s multipurpose room operations 
although table sales still predominate the volume of this operation  much of the increases in sales can be attributed to increases in chair sales 
during the upcoming fiscal year  the company anticipates launching at least one additional chair line to complement its existing chair lines as well as enhancing its current offering 
beyond the upcoming year  the company anticipates developing additional complementary chair lines to continue to grow this portion of its business as well as further penetrating its existing marketplace with its current lines of chairs 
however  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to successfully develop and launch such chair lines or further penetrate its existing marketplace 
healthcare seating 
through broda  the company markets a line of healthcare seating products primarily to customers in canada and the united states 
broda s operations are based in waterloo  ontario  canada 
broda focuses on providing products which assist long term care patients with advanced needs due to a debilitating condition or disease  and has developed a line of premium priced geriatric seating products 
broda chairs are serving a very specific niche in the healthcare market and thus are not competing in the commodity oriented general healthcare seating market 
healthcare seating outlook 
the company believes that the specialty healthcare seating market is less subject to economic pressures than the company s multipurpose room furniture operations 
however  the medical and healthcare industry is more subject to regulatory changes that could affect the demand for broda s products 
the company is not aware of any regulatory changes in the near future that would have a substantial and negative impact on this business 
the company s healthcare seating operation s future growth depends largely upon increasing its market penetration into the us market and other foreign markets as well as its ability to successfully introduce new product lines 
general near term outlook 
based on the reasons stated above  the company anticipates that sales volumes during the quarter ending june  will be up to percent higher as compared to the prior year s first quarter 
despite these expectations  the company  for a variety of reasons including those described in item a risk factors  may not be successful in achieving this sales level in the first quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and footnotes 
the critical accounting policies for the company which require management to make judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the reserve for obsolete inventory  accruals for warranty expense  assets related to the discontinued next generation table line see note  impairment of assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  notes receivable  income taxes  and revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company exercises considerable judgment in determining the ultimate collectability of its accounts receivable 
several factors are used in making these judgments including the customer credit quality  historical write off experience and current economic trends 
the company reviews these factors quarterly  and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  an additional allowance may be required 
reserve for obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
additionally  the company evaluates its inventory reserves in terms of excess and obsolete exposures 
this evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover and ultimate product sales value see note in the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for warranty expense the company s warranty service costs for fiscal years ended march    and totaled percent of net sales or  percent of net sales or  and percent of net sales or  respectively 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
this warranty obligation is affected by failure rates  the introduction of new products  and the costs of material and labor to repair or replace the product 
the company regularly assesses the adequacy of its accrual for warranty expense based upon historical warranty rates and anticipated future warranty rates 
assets related to the discontinued next generation table line due to the decision by the board of directors in january to discontinue the next generation table project  the company has impaired certain long term assets during the quarter ending march  the company utilized an outside specialist to help management establish the fair value of the assets which involved considerable judgment 
this resulted in an impairment charge of million related to the fixed assets see note in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews annually the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill arose from the broda and versipanel acquisitions 
the other intangible asset at march  was intellectual property related to certain rights the company obtained to utilize new technology in its next generation table product development efforts 
during the quarter ended june  the company annually reviews the goodwill related to the broda and versipanel acquisitions and the intellectual property related to the startup development company 
this review is performed by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
no impairment charges have been recorded related to the broda or versipanel goodwill 
however  due to the decision by the board of directors in january to discontinue the next generation table project  the company fully impaired the other intangible asset related to this intellectual property during the quarter ended march  this resulted in an impairment charge of  related to other intangible assets see note in the consolidated financial statements 
notes receivable the company reviews its notes receivable to determine likely collectability 
since the notes are with entities without a long history of an ability to create future cash flows  the company bases its belief in their collectability upon its understanding of what the liquidation value of the operation would be and the likelihood of the company being able to recover the outstanding balances 
due to the level of uncertainty in the success of these entities  these notes receivable ultimately may not be fully realized 
income taxes the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets based upon expected future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future earnings will be sufficient to recover deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as revised by sab no 
sales are recorded when title passes and collectability is reasonably assured under its various shipping terms 
revenue is normally recognized upon shipment of goods to customers 
in certain circumstances revenue is not recognized until the goods are received by the customer based on the terms of the sale agreement 
discounts directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
recently issued financial accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
sfas no 
r  as amended by the securities exchange commission  will be effective for the company s first quarter in its fiscal year beginning april   and requires the use of the modified prospective application method 
under this method  sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
in addition  companies may use the modified retrospective application method 
this method may be applied to all prior years for which the original sfas no 
was effective or only to prior interim periods in the year of initial adoption 
if the modified retrospective application method is applied  financial statements for prior periods shall be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards on a consistent basis with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods under the original sfas no 
the company anticipates using the modified prospective application method 
the company has not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of sfas no 
r  but it is expected that the new standard will result in significant stock based compensation expense 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of opinion are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
although such pro forma effects of applying original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas no 
r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by the company to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method as described below chosen for adopting sfas no 
r 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company intends to adopt sfas no 
on april  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin no 
an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 
 as amended  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
fin no 
applies in the first year or interim period ending after december  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company does not have an interest in any variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no 
did not impact the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

impact of inflation and environmental regulations during the fiscal year ended march   the company experienced inflation on several of its raw materials including steel  plastic and wood

during these two fiscal years  the company has implemented price increases on its products in response to these increases and has been able to recover part of its increased costs 
however  the company has been unable to fully maintain its previous margins 
the company plans to continue to implement these price increases and is hopeful to regain its previous position with respect to margins  but can give no assurance that it will be successful in doing so 
the company estimates that the effects of inflation on its material costs has been to increase the costs of materials as a percent of sales by less than one percentage point during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the prior fiscal year

however  significant increases in the price of raw materials could occur and have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company believes that compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not materially affected the company s operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manufactures its products in the united states and canada and sells its products in those markets as well as in other countries 
the majority of the company s sales and expenses are transacted in us dollars with limited transactions occurring in canadian dollars or other foreign currencies 
for the years ended march  and  approximately percent of the company s net sales  percent of the company s cost of products sold  and percent of the company s operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for the year ended march   approximately percent of the company s net sales  percent of the company s cost of products sold  and percent of the company s operating expenses were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on the financial results of the company during fiscal the company s healthcare chair operations have occasionally entered into forward contracts for specific us dollar denominated accounts receivable 
as of march    and  no forward contracts were outstanding 
the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
the company estimates that a percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates could have reduced operating profit by as much as   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and as mentioned above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility of other effects that may offset such adverse change
