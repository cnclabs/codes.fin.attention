item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that relate to future plans  events  financial results or performance 
you can identify forward looking statements by those that are not historical in nature  particularly those that use terminology such as may  will  should  could  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan  project  predict  intend  potential  continue or the negative of these or similar terms 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections 
these risks and uncertainties include  among others  such factors as general and industry economic trends  uncertainties arising from global events  consumer confidence  effectiveness of our advertising and promotional efforts  our ability to secure suitable retail locations  our ability to attract and retain qualified sales professionals and other key employees  consumer acceptance of our products  product quality  innovation and brand image  our ability to continue to expand and improve our product line  industry competition  warranty expenses  the outcome of pending litigation  including consumer class action litigation  our dependence on significant suppliers  and the vulnerability of any suppliers to recessionary pressures  labor negotiations  liquidity concerns or other factors  rising commodity costs  and increasing government regulations  including new flammability standards for the bedding industry 
additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained under the caption risk factors in this annual report on form k 
overview select comfort is the leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of premium quality  adjustable firmness beds 
the air chamber technology of our proprietary sleep number bed allows adjustable firmness on each side of the mattress and provides a sleep surface that is clinically proven to provide better sleep quality and greater relief of back pain compared to traditional mattress products 
in addition  we market and sell accessories and other sleep related products which focus on providing personalized comfort to complement the sleep number bed and provide a better night s sleep to the consumer 
we generate revenue by selling our products through four complementary distribution channels 
three of these channels retail  direct marketing and e commerce  are company controlled and sell directly to consumers 
our wholesale channel sells to leading home furnishings retailers  specialty bedding retailers  the qvc shopping channel and to several end users such as radisson hotels and resorts 
the proportion of our total net sales  by dollar volume  from each of our channels during the last three years is summarized as follows retail direct marketing e commerce wholesale total the components of sales growth  including comparable store sales increases  are as follows channel increase channel increase channel increase retail comparable store sales increase new closed stores  net retail total direct marketing e commerce wholesale there were weeks in fiscal and and weeks in fiscal comparable store sales and sales growth rates have been adjusted and reported as if each year had the same number of weeks 

table of contents the number of company operated retail stores during the last three years and independently owned and operated retail partner stores  are summarized as follows company owned retail stores beginning of year opened closed end of year retail partner stores we anticipate opening to new retail stores and closing up to five existing stores in we also expect to increase the number of stores in our retail partner program by more than in our growth plans are centered on increasing the awareness of our products and stores through expansion of media  increasing distribution primarily through new retail store openings and supplemented with sales through other mattress retailers  and through improvement and expansion of our product lines 
our primary market consists of the sale of products directly to consumers in the us we believe that opportunities exist longer term for sales internationally and to commercial markets 
in december we entered the canadian market through a retail partner with locations in major canadian markets 
increases in sales  along with controlling costs  have provided significant increases to operating income and operating margin 
the majority of operating margin improvement has been generated through leverage in selling expenses increased sales through the existing store base and leverage of our existing infrastructure general and administrative expenses 
we expect any future improvements in operating margin to be derived from similar sources 
our target is to sustain same store sales growth between and  total annual sales growth rates of to and annual earnings growth rates of between to earnings growth targets are before incremental stock option expense in 
future accounting requirements in the first quarter of fiscal we are required to adopt sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
the pro forma disclosures we have previously made as permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
our pro forma disclosures reported the cost of share based compensation payments as having an annual impact to diluted earnings per share in the range of to for fiscal years through we expect that share based compensation expense under sfas r will reduce our diluted earnings per share by approximately to in 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our results of operations expressed as dollars and percentages of net sales 
figures are in millions except percentages and earnings per share amounts 
of net sales of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative store closings and asset impairments total operating expenses operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net income per share basic diluted weighted average number of common shares basic diluted net sales we record revenue at the time product is shipped to our customer  except when beds are delivered and set up by our home delivery employees  in which case revenue for products and home delivery services is recorded at the time the bed is delivered and set up in the home 
we reduce sales at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns 
this estimate is based on historical return rates  which are reasonably consistent from period to period 
if actual returns vary from expected rates  revenue in future periods is adjusted  which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments to the financial statements due to changes to these estimates 
cost of sales cost of sales includes costs associated with purchasing materials  manufacturing costs and costs to deliver our products to our customers 
cost of sales also includes estimated costs to service warranty claims of customers 
this estimate is based on historical claim rates experienced during the warranty period 
because this estimate covers an extended period of time  a revision of estimated claim rates could result in a significant adjustment of estimated future costs of fulfilling warranty commitments and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
from time to time we have revised our estimates of warranty reserves to reflect changes in projected claim rates and projected costs of fulfilling warranty claims 
however  these estimate revisions have not historically materially affected our annual results 
gross profit our gross profit margin is dependent on a number of factors and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
these factors include the mix of products sold  the level at which we offer promotional discounts to purchase our products  the cost of materials  delivery and manufacturing and the mix of sales between wholesale and company controlled distribution channels 
sales of products manufactured by third parties  such as accessories and our adjustable foundation  generate lower gross margins 
similarly  sales directly to consumers through company controlled channels generally generate higher gross margins than sales through our wholesale channels because we capture both the manufacturer s and retailer s margin 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include advertising and media production  other marketing and selling materials such as brochures  videos  customer mailings and in store signage  sales compensation  store occupancy costs and customer service 
we expense all store opening and advertising costs as incurred 

table of contents advertising expense was million in  million in  and million in future advertising expenditures will depend on the effectiveness and efficiency of the advertising in creating awareness of our products and brand name  generating consumer inquiries and driving consumer traffic to our points of sale 
we anticipate that full year advertising expenditures in will increase by more than to over million 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with management of functional areas  including information technology  human resources  finance  sales and marketing administration  investor relations  risk management and research and development 
costs include salaries  bonus and benefits  information hardware  software and maintenance  office facilities  insurance  shareholder relations costs and other overhead 
store closings and asset impairments store closing and asset impairment expenses include charges made against operating expenses for store related or other capital assets that have been written off when a store is underperforming and generating negative cash flows 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including leaseholds and fixtures in existing stores and stores expected to be remodeled  based on expected cash flows through the remainder of the lease term after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements and marketing programs 
expected cash flows may not be realized  which could cause long lived assets to become impaired in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
store assets are written off when we believe these costs will not be recovered through future operations 
quarterly and annual results quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in comparable store sales  the timing  amount and effectiveness of advertising expenditures  any changes in sales return rates or warranty experience  the timing of new store openings and related expenses  net sales contributed by new stores  the timing of promotional offerings  competitive factors  rising commodity costs  any disruptions in supplies or third party services  seasonality of retail sales  timing of qvc shows and wholesale sales  consumer confidence and general economic conditions 
furthermore  a substantial portion of net sales is often realized in the last month of a quarter  due in part to our promotional schedule and commission structure 
as a result  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner  and our business  financial condition and operating results may be significantly harmed 
our historical results of operations may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any future period 
comparison of and net sales net sales in increased to million from million in  due to a increase in mattress unit sales and higher average selling prices 
the average selling price per bed in our company controlled channels was  an increase of approximately from the higher average selling price resulted primarily from a price increase introduced at the beginning of and improvements in product mix 
the increase in mattress unit sales was driven primarily by growth in same store sales and distribution expansion 
the increase in net sales by sales channel was attributable to i a million increase in sales from our retail stores  including an increase in comparable store sales of million and an increase of million from new stores  net of stores closed  ii a million increase in direct marketing sales  iii a million increase in sales from our e commerce channel and iv a million increase in sales from our wholesale channel 
gross profit gross profit decreased to in from in  primarily due to changes in channel mix ie  increased percentage of our total net sales from our lower margin channels  higher warranty reserves  increased product and delivery costs resulting from rising commodity and fuel costs  offset partially by sales price increases and favorable sales return rates 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses in increased to million from million in and decreased as a percentage of net sales to from for the comparable prior year period 
the million increase was primarily due to additional media investments  increased number of stores and variable costs due to higher sales 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was comprised primarily of a percentage point ppt increase in leverage of media investments  ppt of other marketing leverage and a ppt leverage of fixed costs occupancy  base sales compensation and certain marketing 
table of contents expenses over higher sales 
with additional sales growth  we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales to decline in as we achieve greater leverage from our base sales compensation and occupancy costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses in increased to million from million in and increased as a percentage of net sales to from for the comparable prior year period 
the dollar increase in g a was primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense of million resulting from our all employee incentive compensation program  increased compensation and benefits expenses related to additional headcount of million  increased professional fees of million  and million in additional depreciation and maintenance expense from information technology infrastructure investments 
we generally expect future g a growth rates to be lower than the rate of sales growth due to leveraging the fixed component of g a expenses across a higher sales base  excluding stock option compensation expense in other income  net other income increased million to million in from million in the improvement is primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher average balances of invested cash and higher interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million to in from in principally due to higher pre tax income 
the effective tax rate was in and in comparison of and net sales net sales in increased to million from million in  due to a increase in mattress unit sales and higher average selling prices 
the additional week in fiscal reduced sales growth in by approximately 
the average selling price per bed in our company controlled channels was  an increase of approximately from the higher average selling price resulted primarily from growth in unit sales at higher price points following the introduction of a new luxury mattress model at the upper end of our model line up 
the increase in net sales by sales channel was attributable to i a million increase in sales from our retail stores  including an increase in comparable store sales of million  an estimated million reduction in sales due to a rd week in and an increase of million from new stores  net of stores closed  ii a million increase in direct marketing sales  iii a million increase in sales from our e commerce channel and iv a million increase in sales from our wholesale channel

the dollar increase in g a was 
table of contents primarily due to higher headcount related expenditures of million  increased professional fees of million  and million in additional depreciation and maintenance expense from information technology infrastructure investments  offset by a reduction in incentive compensation expense of million 
other income  net other income increased million to million in from million in the improvement is primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher average balances of invested cash and higher interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million to in from in due to higher pre tax income and effective tax rates 
the effective tax rate was in and in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  of which million is classified as a current asset 
as of january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  of which million is classified as a current asset 
working capital totaled million at the end of compared to million at year end the decrease in working capital was due primarily to an increase in accrued compensation and benefits reflecting an increase in the company s all employee incentive compensation program 
the million improvement in cash and marketable securities balances were the result of generating million of operating free cash flow million of cash provided by operating activities  reduced by million of capital expenditures  offset by million of cash used in financing activities 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future  while not anticipating significant additional working capital requirements 
we generated cash from operations of million in and million in the million year to year improvement in cash from operations resulted primarily from improved net income of million  reductions in net operating assets and liabilities of million  higher depreciation expense of million and a decrease in deferred tax assets of million 
capital expenditures amounted to million in  compared to million in in both periods our capital expenditures related primarily to new and remodeled retail stores and investments in information technology 
in  we opened retail stores  while in  we opened retail stores and completed the marquee and design upgrade of approximately stores 
we anticipate opening to new stores in and relocating approximately existing stores 
we will fund the investment in new and upgraded stores with cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we expect our new stores to be cash flow positive within the first months of operations and  as a result  do not anticipate a negative effect on net cash provided by operations 
management expects capital expenditures in fiscal to total between and million for distribution expansion  manufacturing productivity enhancements and technology improvements  including infrastructure supporting our long term plans for expansion into international markets 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  compared to million in the million increase in cash used in financing activities was comprised of a million increase in repurchases of common stock under our board authorized common stock repurchase program offset by an increase of million received for exercises of stock options and warrants and for employee purchases of common stock 
additional purchases of select comfort stock may be made from time to time  subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices  through open market purchases 
repurchased shares will be retired and may be reissued in the future for general corporate or other purposes 
total outstanding authorization as of february  was million 
we may terminate or limit the stock repurchase program at any time 
cash generated from operations should be a sufficient source of liquidity for the short and long term and should provide adequate funding for capital expenditures and common stock repurchases  if any 
in addition  our business model  which can operate with minimal working capital  does not require significant additional capital to fund operations 
in  we obtained a million bank revolving line of credit to provide additional cash flexibility in the case of unexpected significant external or internal developments 
the line of credit is a three year senior secured revolving facility expiring may the interest rate on borrowings is calculated using libor plus to with the incremental rate dependent on our leverage ratio  as defined by the lender 
we are subject to certain financial covenants under the agreement  principally consisting of minimum liquidity requirements  working capital and leverage ratios 
we have remained and expect to remain in the foreseeable future in full compliance with the financial covenants 
while we have not had borrowings outstanding under this 
table of contents credit agreement  we expect to obtain a new line of credit with expanded borrowing capacity prior to expiration of the agreement 
the table below represents the scheduled maturities of our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total year years years years operating leases inventory purchase commitments total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could materially affect the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies relate to share based compensation  revenue recognition  accrued sales returns  accrued warranty costs  and store closing and long lived asset impairment expenses 
in certain instances  us generally accepted accounting principles allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
one such significant accounting policy involves the selection from alternative methods of accounting for stock options 
share based compensation two alternative methods currently exist for accounting for stock options the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
we use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the financial statements for options granted to employees  or for the discount feature of our employee stock purchase plan 
in accordance with sfas r  we are required to change our accounting practice for stock options to the fair value method by the first quarter of fiscal  beginning january  revenue recognition we record revenue at the time product is shipped to our customer  except when beds are delivered and set up by our home delivery employees  in which case revenue is recorded at the time the bed is delivered and set up in the home 
accrued sales returns we reduce sales at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns 
this estimate is based on historical return rates  which are reasonably consistent from period to period 
if actual returns vary from expected rates  revenue in future periods is adjusted  which could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
accrued warranty costs the estimated costs to service customer warranty claims is included in cost of sales 
this estimate is based on historical claim rates during the warranty period 
because this estimate covers an extended period of time  a revision of estimated claim rates and or rising commodity costs could result in a significant adjustment of estimated future costs of fulfilling warranty commitments and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
from time to time we have revised our estimates of warranty reserves to reflect changes in projected claim rates and projected costs of fulfilling warranty claims 
historically  these estimate revisions have not materially affected our annual results 
store closing and asset impairment expenses we evaluate our long lived assets  including leaseholds and fixtures in existing stores  based on expected cash flows through the remainder of the lease term after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements and marketing programs 
expected cash flows may not be realized  which could cause long lived assets to become impaired in future periods and could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
store assets are written off when we believe these costs will not be recovered through future operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments 
the counterparties to the agreements consist of government agencies and various major corporations of investment grade credit standing 
we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk of non performance by these counterparties because we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and any one type of investment
