to insure that a new restaurant opens with the high quality of service for which the company is known  the company has a select group of employees  known as new restaurant openers  who travel to new restaurants for that purpose

package goods sales are also expected to increase due to continued increases in same store sales 
franchise royalties are expected to increase due to the new restaurant in wellington  florida  the anticipated opening of the new restaurant in pinecrest  florida and continued increases in same store sales for the limited partnerships and franchises

the company intends to open additional restaurants as suitable locations become available  using limited partnerships  of which it is the general partner  to raise funds to own and operate the same

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimate of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
management estimates the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
consolidation of limited partnerships the company operates restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants 
additionally  the company expects that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in the company operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest the company also purchases limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  the company consolidates the operations of these limited partnerships with those of the company despite the fact the company does not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the minority interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share 
income taxes financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
for discussion regarding the company s carryforwards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal other matters impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had any material effect during the past three fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes  but as of october  holds one equity security  at a cost of  for dividend payments 
even if the price of the equity securities decreased by below its cost  results of operations would be reduced by  an amount management considers immaterial 
interest rate risk at october   the company has two debt arrangements which have a variable interest rate 
for one of these instruments  a mortgage note  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk 
the mortgage note has an outstanding principal balance at october  of  for the other instrument  an unsecured promissory note in the principal amount of  the variable interest rate is at prime  so even if interest rates increased by  results of operations would be reduced by less than  an amount management also considers immaterial

any decrease in interest rates will have a negative effect on the company s earnings
