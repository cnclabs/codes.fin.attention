information pertaining to the company s business segments is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis 
insurance premium revenue recognition and policy charges life traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits  primarily term and whole life insurance products 
premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due 
annuities and interest sensitive life contracts  such as universal life and interest sensitive whole life  are contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed 
premiums from these policies are reported as funds on deposit 
policy charges consist of fees assessed against the policyholder for cost of insurance mortality risk  policy administration and early surrender 
these revenues are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
policies that do not subject the company to significant risk arising from mortality or morbidity are considered investment contracts 
deposits received from such contracts are reported as other policyholder funds 
policy charges for investment contracts consist of fees assessed against the policyholder account for maintenance  administration and surrender of the policy prior to contractually specified dates  and are recognized when assessed against the policyholder account balance 
health premiums for short duration medical insurance contracts are intended to cover expected claim costs resulting from insured events that occur during a fixed period of short duration 
the company has the ability to cancel the annual contract or to revise the premium rates at the beginning of each annual contract period to cover future insured events 
insurance premiums from annual health contracts are collected monthly and are recognized as revenue evenly as insurance protection is provided 
premiums related to long term and short term disability contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses including legal  other fees  and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment function for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are in accordance with gaap 
many factors could affect these reserves  including economic and social conditions  frequency and severity of claims  medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation 
therefore  the company s reserves are necessarily based on estimates  assumptions and analysis of historical experience 
the company s results depend upon the variation between actual claims experience and the assumptions used in determining reserves and pricing products 
reserve assumptions and estimates require significant judgment and  therefore  are inherently uncertain 
the company cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that will be paid for actual claims or the timing of those payments 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
loss reserves differ for short duration and long duration insurance policies  including annuities 
reserves are based on approved actuarial methods  but necessarily include assumptions about expenses  mortality  morbidity  lapse rates and future yield on related investments 
all of the company s short duration contracts are generated from its accident and health business  and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
life for traditional life insurance products  the company computes insurance reserves primarily using the net premium method based on anticipated investment yield  mortality  and withdrawals 
these methods are widely used in the life insurance industry to estimate the liabilities for insurance reserves 
inherent in these calculations are management and actuarial judgments and estimates that could significantly impact the ending reserve liabilities and  consequently  operating results 
actual results may differ  and these estimates are subject to interpretation and change 
policyholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products  such as universal life  interest sensitive life and annuities 
policyholder funds are comprised primarily of deposits received and interest credited to the benefit of the policyholder less surrenders and withdrawals  mortality charges and administrative expenses 
interest credited interest credited to policyholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest sensitive life policies and investment policies 
amounts charged to operations including interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances are reported as insurance benefits  claims and reserves life and annuity 
credit rates for certain annuities and interest sensitive life policies are adjusted periodically by the company to reflect current market conditions  subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates 
health the company believes that its recorded insurance reserves are reasonable and adequate to satisfy its ultimate liability 
the company primarily uses its own loss development experience  but will also supplement that with data from its outside actuaries  reinsurers and industry loss experience as warranted 
to illustrate the impact that projected net loss ratios have on the company s loss reserves and related expenses  each hypothetical change in the net loss ratio for the health business ie  the ratio of benefits  claims and settlement expenses to earned health premiums for the year ended december   would increase reserves in the case of a higher ratio or decrease reserves in the case of a lower ratio by approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
depending on the circumstances surrounding a change in the net loss ratio  other pre tax amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations could also be affected  such as amortization of deferred acquisition costs and commission expense 
the company s health reserves by segment at december  are as follows in thousands policy claim total health claims reserves reserves medical stop loss fully insured health group disability credit a h individual a h and other medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss segment is comprised of employer stop loss  hmo reinsurance and provider excess 
all of the company s medical stop loss policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
the two primary assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying pricing assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net loss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is set using pricing assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible as is the case with the underwriting year which deviated by ten net loss ratio points  based on a review of historical net loss ratios experienced by the company  the reasonably likely deviation from the expected net loss ratio was between three and five net loss ratio points 
therefore  based on its experience to date  it was reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected pricing net loss ratio 
the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately mi llion with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to the company s underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than first dollar medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected net loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying pricing assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
reserves for hmo reinsurance and provider excess are adjusted on a policy by policy basis 
because of the small number of hmo reinsurance and provider excess policies it writes  the company is able to evaluate each policy individually for potential liability by reviewing open claims with each hmo or provider group and applying completion factors using historical data 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured reserves is that historical claim development patterns are representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in time delay in submission of claims  and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impacts of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
group disability the company s group disability segment is comprised of long term disability ltd and disability benefits law dbl 
the two primary assumptions on which group disability reserves are based are i morbidity levels  and ii recovery rates 
if morbidity levels increase  for example due to an epidemic or a recessionary environment  the company would increase reserves because there would be more new claims than expected 
in regard to the assumed recovery rate  if disabled lives recover more quickly than anticipated then the existing claims reserves would be reduced  if less quickly  the existing claims reserves would be increased 
advancements in medical treatments could affect future recovery  termination  and mortality rates 
with respect to ltd only  other assumptions are i changes in market interest rates  ii changes in offsets  iii advancements in medic al treatments  and iv cost of living 
changes in market interest rates could change reserve assumptions since the payout period could be as long as years 
changes in offsets such as social security benefits  retirement plans and state disability plans also impact reserving 
as a result of the forgoing assumptions  it is possible that the historical trend may not be an accurate predictor of the future development of the block 
as with most long term insurance reserves that require judgment  the reserving process is subject to uncertainty and volatility and fluctuations may not be indicative of the claim development overall 
while the company believes that larger variations are possible  the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its primary assumptions would have a material effect 
credit accident and health a h the primary assumptions used in estimating the credit a h reserves relate to i the mix of ages of the insured  ii the rate of disability  and iii the rate of mortality of disabled lives 
if the mix is skewed towards older age groups the probability of disability increases 
if the rate of disability increases  the company would increase reserves 
if mortality of disabled lives improves  the company would have to pay benefits for a longer period of time 
ranges are not used to determine the ultimate amount of reported reserves for credit a h 
management records its best estimate based on the company s experience 
credit a h policies are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported 
the company establishes reserves for benefit claims that i have been reported  but not paid  and ii have been incurred  but not reported 
individual a h and other this segment is a combination of closed lines of business as well as certain small existing lines 
while the assumptions used in setting reserves vary between these different lines of business  the assumptions would generally relate to the following i the rate of disability  ii the morbidity rates on specific diseases  and iii accident rates 
the reported reserves are based on management s best estimate for each line within this segment 
general uncertainties that surround all insurance reserving methodologies would apply 
however  since the company has such few policies of this type  volatility may occur due to a small number of claims 
deferred acquisition costs costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring insurance policies and investment type contracts are deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
these costs are principally broker fees  agent commissions  and the purchase prices of acquired blocks of business 
dac is amortized to expense and reported separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
all dac within a particular product type is amortized on the same basis using the following methods life for traditional life insurance and other premium paying policies accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amortization of dac is charged to expense over the related premium revenue recognition period 
assumptions used in the amortization of dac are determined based upon the conditions as of the date of policy issue or assumption and are not generally revised during the life of the policy 
for long duration type contracts accounted for under sfas no 
 such as annuities and universal life business  amortization of dac is charged to expense over the life of the book of such contracts based on the present value of the estimated gross profits egps expected to be realized over the life of the book of contracts 
egps consist of margins based on expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  and other revenues and expenses 
the company regularly evaluates its egp s to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
if the company determines that the current assumptions underlying the egps are no longer the best estimate for the future due to changes in actual versus expected mortality rates  persistency rates  interest rate spreads  or other revenues and expenses  the future egps are updated using the new assumptions an d prospective unlocking occurs 
these updated egps are locked into for future amortization calculations 
the total amortization recorded to date is adjusted through a current charge or credit to the consolidated statement of operations 
health for credit health insurance policies accounted for under sfas no 
 amortization of dac is charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
investments the company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in either accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
the company has approximately million and million in trading accounts at december  and  respectively 
net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as net realized losses 
the factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions  and the company s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
for securities within the scop e of emerging issues task force issue  such as purchased interest only securities  an impairment loss is recognized when there has been a decrease in expected cash flows combined with a decline in the security s fair value below cost

the million increase in insurance reserves life and annuity is primarily due to the acquisition of policy blocks 
the million increase in funds on deposit is primarily a result of the purchase of individual annuity policies in the second quarter of the million increase in total stockholders equity is primarily due to net income generated in the year ended december  and issuances of common shares  partially offset by an increase in net unreal ized losses on investments  dividend payments and purchases of the company s common stock 
the company had net receivables from reinsurers of million at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from the company s affiliate  independence american  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary at december  as of december   the balance due from independence american is million 
asset quality the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable statutes and regulations  which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the insurance group s investment assets  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed maturities  resale agreements  policy loans and cash and cash equivalents at december  also at such date  approximately of the insurance group s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   approximately of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in diversified non investment grade fixed maturities investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greater risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any mortgage loans or non performing fixed maturities at december  investment impairments the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an insignificant realized loss for other temporary impairments 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a realized loss for other than temporary impairments of 
million of which 
million related to certain interest only securities io securities resulting from unexpected prepayments of the mortgage obligations underlying the io securities due to falling interest rates 
at december   the company had no investments in io securities 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled million at december  substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the company holds all fixed maturities as available for sale securities and  accordingly  marks all of its fixed maturities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
the unrealized losses on all available for sale securities have been evaluated in accordance with the company s policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  health reserves the following table summarizes the prior year amount incurred in according to the year to which it relates  together with the reserve at the beginning of the year to which it relates in thousands reserves at december  prior year amount incurred total reserves and prior total the following sections describe  for each segment  the deficiency unfavorable development or redundancy favorable development experienced in  together with the key assumptions and changes therein affecting the reserve estimates 
medical stop loss the company experienced net unfavorable development of million in the medical stop loss segment 
the net unfavorable development is based on million negative development in the reserves  partially offset by positive development of million related to prior years 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below this ratio 
the company sets its pricing and underwriting guidelines at the beginning of each treaty year based on its evaluation of its own experience and current market conditions 
changes in market conditions through the treaty year have unexpected effects on the underwriting and rating decisions of its mgus and produce results which vary from the expectations implicit in its pricing 
with respect to the reserves  the d eviation above the company s estimated projected net loss ratio was ten net loss ratio points 
the higher deviation for was largely a result of i the soft medical stop loss market continuing longer than anticipated  ii deviations from underwriting guidelines and disclosure protocols by certain of its mgus and producers as a result of the soft market  which were detected by the company in its underwriting audits  and iii an unanticipated continuation of historically high inpatient hospital cost trends 
this larger than expected deviation was magnified for reserves because of an overall increase in the company s risk retention in that year 
with respect to the and prior reserves  the positive deviation resulted from loss development being much lower than anticipated based on the company s historical loss development patterns 
this resulted from actual loss development from more recently appointed mgu s during this period and therefore their deve lopment patterns were not included in historical company loss development statistics 
group disability the group disability segment had a favorable development of million 
this amount consists of a favorable development of million on the reserves primarily due to dbl and an unfavorable development of 
million for all other years due to ltd 
due to the long term nature of ltd  in establishing loss reserves the company must make estimates for case reserves  incurred but not reported reserves ibnr  and reserves for loss adjustment expenses lae 
case reserves generally equal the company s best estimate of the present value of the liability for future benefits to be paid on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the lae reserve is calculated based on an actuarial expense study 
since the ltd block of policies is relatively small  results can vary from year to year solely on the basis of one or two policies 
it is not uncommon for a reserve of several hundred thousand dollars to be associated with one policy 
if a small number of claimants with large policy reserves were to recover or a few large claims were incurred  the results could distort the company s reserve estim ates from year to year 
however  there were no individual factors in that caused the unfavorable development in ltd 
with respect to dbl  reserves for the most recent quarter of earned premium are established using a net loss ratio methodology 
the net loss ratio is determined by applying the completed prior four quarters of historical net loss ratios to the last quarter of earned premium 
reserves associated with the premium earned prior to the last quarter are established using a completion factor methodology 
the completion factors are developed using the historical payment patterns for dbl 
the favorable development in the dbl line is due to lower than expected claims 
there were no changes in the company s experience factor or the ibnr factor for group disability 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to credit a h the credit a h unfavorable development for was 
million which relates to reserves 
there were no changes in the company s experience factor or the ibnr factor for credit a h used in the reserving process from to individual a h and other the individual a h and other segment had a favorable development of 
million for the favorable development was not due to a change in assumptions  but rather the volatility of having a relatively small block of business 
the reserving process used by management was consistent from to capital resources due to its strong capital ratios  broad licensing and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the insurance group remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in november  december and march  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively  through pooled trust preferred issuances by subsidiary trusts 
in september  the company entered into a million line of credit  all of which was drawn down 
the cash proceeds of the line of credit and the trust preferred securities issued in were used to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item ihc enters into a variety of contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of its operations 
these obligations  as of december   are set forth in the table below 
however  we do not believe that our cash flow requirements can be fully assessed based upon an analysis of these obligations 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  also will vary based upon our future needs 
although some outflows are fixed  others depend on future events 
the company had the following expected contractual obligations relating to debt  trust preferred securities junior subordinated debt  non cancelable leases  insurance reserves and funds on deposit at december  junior funds subordinated insurance on debt debt leases reserves deposit total and thereafter totals in accordance with sfas no 
 the company may carry its portfolio of fixed maturities either as held to maturity carried at amortized cost  as trading securities carried at fair market value or as available for sale carried at fair market value 
the company has chosen to carry all of its debt securities as available for sale 
in  the company experienced an increase in unrealized losses of million which  net of deferred tax benefits of million and net of deferred policy acquisition costs of million  decreased stockholders equity by million reflecting net unrealized losses of million at december  compared to net unrealized losses of million at december  
from time to time  as warranted  the company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
outlook ihc has historically been a life and health insurance holding company for two insurance companies  standard security life insurance company of new york standard security life and madison national life insurance company  inc madison national life  which relied on independent general agents  managing general underwriters mgus and administrators to perform the majority of all marketing  underwriting  claims and administrative functions for its two primary product segments m edical s top l oss and g roup disability  life  annuities and dbl 
for  ihc s business plan is to i improve the profitability of its core lines of business  in particular medical stop loss  while expanding distribution  ii diversify its product mix by accelerating its expansion into the fully insured health insurance sector  and thereby reduce the volatility of its portfolio and reduce its exposure to market cycles  and iii continue to acquire blocks of life and annuity business  and blocks of fully insured health and dental 
the following summarizes what ihc has accomplish ed and the outlook for and beyond by segment 
historic core lines of business the company s operating results have been heavily dependent on the results of its medical stop loss line of business  particularly as ihc h as increased its risk retention in recent years 
the company emphasizes underwriting profits and not top line growth 
however  medical stop loss is excess business  which is more volatile and tends to be more cyclical in nature than fully insured health business 
when an excess product experiences several consecutive years of underwriting profitability  it is not unusual for there to be more competitors entering that line  which can increase pressure on pricing and create a softer market 
the medical stop loss market began to soften in  and less favorable conditions continued through despite these market conditions  the company produced net loss ratio s of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  from its medical stop loss line 
while still profitable in  the company does not consider this to be an acceptable net loss ratio 
in  the company increased rates and made changes in its underwriting guidelines in response to the results of its underwriting audits 
based on currently available information  business incepting in  of which a material portion will be earned and recorded in  is projected to achieve a net loss ratio that is lower than the previous year 
with respect to distribution  standard security life writes medical stop loss in all states through mgus 
madison national life  which began writing medical stop loss in after it was upgraded to a excellent by am best  writes this line in states through five mgus 
of these mgus  the company has a significant ownership interest in nine mgus including those owned by amic  which produced million of ihc s medical stop loss premium in as a result of these changes and competitors willingness to write business at profit margins lower than those acceptable to ihc  the company s gross premiums from medical stop loss were reduced by approximately million in in late  the company appointed three new independent mgus that are expected to add substantial premiums in the company does not anticipate significant growth or shrinkage in its other historic core business  including group life and disability  dbl  and credit life and disability 
expansion of fully insured health segment through the acquisitions of hpa and grouplink  which is owned by ihc  in and iac in  ihc has expanded into multiple new fully insured health first dollar health product s  including short term medical st m  group major medical including consumer driven health plans cdhps  dental and vision the fully insured health products 
these products are now approved in the majority of states  although the company does not anticipate writing cdhps in the northeastern and certain other states 
ihc will further expand its f ully i nsured h ealth p roducts in to include major medical for individuals and families including cdhps and limited medical 
collectively  ihc will administer  manage and distribute its fully insured health products to  general agents  agents and brokers producers in the majority of states 
ihc believes this will be one of the largest networks of producers focusing on the sale of fully insured health products in the country 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the company acquired of cais  which will market major medical for groups  individuals and families including cdhps  stm and dental products on behalf of ihc 
cais has announced that it has signed a definitive agreement subject to certain closing conditions to acquire a block of approximately million of small group major medical business including cdhps and key personnel of a marketing and administrative company 
it is anticipated that most of this million block of small group medical business will be trans ition ed to madison national life as of august  the company believes that in the next several years  its fully insured health premiums may exceed its medical stop loss premiums 
the f ully i nsured h ealth market is a much larger market than the excess market  estimated at billion compared to a medical stop loss market of approximately billion 
as a result of its multiple product filings  distribution sources  and the sheer size of the market  the company is optimistic that its f ully i nsured health business will grow rapidly while yielding profitable results  which will help balance the more volatile and cyclical m edical s top l oss business 
expansion of life annuity block acquisitions ihc will continue to look for financially viable life and annuity acquisitions during although the source and timing of new acquisitions is unpredictable  the company believes that there exists an ample supply of acquisition prospects for the remainder of it is doubtful that ihc would make a major life and annuity acquisition during the first half of but the probability increases during the second half of the addition of grouplink has now made it possible to acquire blocks of dental business  and the company made its first such acquisition in the first quarter of the company is also exploring the possibility of leveraging the administrative capabilities of iac and grouplink to administer large blocks of life and annuities for other carriers for whom this is not a core business 
in summary  the company anticipates improved operating performance in as a result of i increased premiums and fee income from multiple fully insured health products distributed through greatly expanded distribution channels as a result of the acquisitions during and the first quarter of of iac  hpa  grouplink  and cais  ii improved profitability of its medical stop loss business through corrective actions instituted for the business incepting in and increases in production due to the appointment of additional mgus  iii reduced susceptibility to market cycles due to a better balance between excess and fully insured health business  and iv continued acquisitions of blocks of business

the fsp also addresses accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment loss on a debt security  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp replaces the impairment guidance in eitf issue no

under the fsp  an impairment loss must be recognized in earnings in an am ount equal to the entire difference between the security s cost and its fair value at the financial statement date  without considering partial recoveries subsequent to that date 
the fsp also requires that an investor recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when a decision to sell a security has been made and the investor does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company does not expect that the application of the fsp will have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or financial statement disclosures

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a portfolio with a duration and average life that falls within the band of the duration and average life of the applicable liabilities 
options may be utilized to modify the duration and average life of such assets  see note f iv of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes the estimated pre tax change in fair value based upon hypothetical parallel shifts in the us treasury yield curve of the fixed income portfolio assuming immediate changes in interest rates at specified levels at december  estimated estimated change change in interest rates fair value in fair value in millions basis point rise basis point rise base scenario basis point decline basis point decline the company monitors its investment portfolio on a continuous basis and believes that the liquidity of the insurance group will not be adversely affected by its current investments 
this monitoring includes the maintenance of an asset liability model that matches current insurance liability cash flows with current investment cash flows 
this is accomplished by first creating an insurance model of the company s in force policies using current assumptions on mortality  lapses and expenses 
then  current investments are assigned to specific insurance blocks in the model using appropriate prepayment schedules and future reinvestment patterns 
the results of the model specify whether the investments and their related cash flows can support the related current insurance cash flows 
additionally  various scenarios are developed changing interest rates and other related assumptions 
these scenarios help evaluate the market risk due to changing interest rates in relation to the business of the insurance group 
in the company s analysis of the asset liability model  a to basis point change in interest rates on the insurance group s liabilities would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the company 
with respect to its liabilities  if interest rates were to increase  the risk to the company is that policies would be surrendered and assets would need to be sold 
this is not a material exposure to the company since a large portion of the insurance group s interest sensitive policies are burial policies that are not subject to the typical surrender patterns of other interest sensitive policies  and many of the insurance group s universal life and annuity policies were acquired from liquidated companies which tend to exhibit lower surrender rates than such policies of continuing companies 
additionally  there are charges to help offset the benefits being surrendered 
if interest rates were to decrease substant ially  the risk to the company is that some of its investment assets would be subject to early redemption 
this is not a material exposure because the company would have additional unrealized gains in its investment portfolio to help offset the future reduction of investment income 
with respect to its investments  the company employs from time to time as warranted investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures
