item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tennant company is a world leader in designing  manufacturing and marketing solutions that help create a cleaner  safer world 
we provide equipment  parts and consumables and floor coatings to contract cleaners  end user businesses  healthcare facilities  schools and local  state and federal governments 
we sell our products through our direct sales and service organization and a network of authorized distributors worldwide 
geographically  our customers are primarily located in north america  europe and other international markets including the middle east  asia  japan  latin america and australia 
we strive to be an innovator in our industry through our commitment to understanding our customers needs and using our expertise to create innovative solutions 
tennant achieved significant improvements in our results with record net sales of million and a increase in diluted earnings per share to 
current year growth in net sales of was complemented by a year over year improvement of in operating profit to million  driven in part by a percentage point increase in gross margin 
sales of new products  launched primarily in  contributed about half of the growth in net sales 
our continued efforts to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs enabled us to leverage this growth in net sales into improved profitability 
the improvements in profitability were accomplished despite rising costs for raw materials and other purchased components  as we were able to successfully mitigate the impact of cost increases through price increases 
a decrease in the effective tax rate of percentage points also contributed to the improved profitability 
partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in selling and administrative expenses of  primarily due to higher performance based incentive compensation 
tennant s financial position remains strong  allowing us to continue to reinvest in innovative product development and new systems capabilities 
we ended with a debt to capital ratio of and million in cash and cash equivalents 
we generated operating cash flows of million during  an increase of over we closed the year with h 
chris killingstad assuming the chief executive officer role after serving as the vice president of north america since april in addition  we launched our corporate priorities that focus on leveraging our global cost structure through expansion in china  global sourcing  creating a lean enterprise  continuous process improvement as well as growth through innovation and expanded market coverage 
during the fourth quarter of  we launched initiatives to establish a manufacturing facility in china and rationalize our global manufacturing footprint 
during  we expect to incur million in costs associated with these initiatives 
in connection with the manufacturing footprint rationalization  the company anticipates selling its maple grove  minnesota facility 
while the company cannot estimate the impact of selling this facility in because of the uncertainty of the transaction price and timing  the company anticipates a substantial gain on the sale 
through these initiatives and by establishing asia as a key source for parts and components  we expect to broaden our global sourcing capabilities  reduce product costs and improve operating efficiencies over the next three to five years 
in addition  we will continue our efforts to transform tennant into a lean enterprise 
through the adoption of lean manufacturing principles and continuous focus on process improvement  we will strive to become more efficient  better employ automation and lower our operating costs 
during  we plan to further invest in our systems capabilities to enhance customer relationship management  global supply chain and financial analysis capabilities 
lastly  we believe we can continue to grow our revenue through innovation in both the products and services we offer and expansion of our market coverage 
in  new product launches are planned for all market segments 
we plan to continue our efforts to build a profitable growth platform in europe and expand our market coverage in our other international markets including china  eastern europe  brazil  india and mexico 
these initiatives should also support our efforts to meet the business challenges we face 
current challenges facing tennant include successful mitigation  primarily through price increases  of continued cost increases for raw materials and other purchased components due to rising commodity costs 
although management believes that steel prices have stabilized  we expect to see a continued trend of rising oil and gas prices driving increases in our cost of fuel and petroleum based products in macro economic indicators for our industry showed general improvement in  however  the global economy remains unpredictable and somewhat volatile 
the relative strength or weakness of the global economies in may impact demand for our products and services in the markets we serve in our results continue to be impacted by changes in value of the us dollar primarily against the euro  the australian and canadian dollars  the british pound and the japanese yen 
in  we will also begin to have a foreign currency exchange impact related to the chinese yuan 
to the extent the applicable exchange rates weaken relative to the us dollar  the related direct foreign currency exchange effect would have an unfavorable impact on our results 
if the applicable exchange rates strengthen relative to the us dollar  our results would be favorably impacted 
historical results the following compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and in dollars and as a percentage of net sales dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net sales   cost of sales   gross profit   research and development expenses   selling and administrative expenses   profit from operations   other income expense interest income    interest expense  net foreign currency transaction gains losses miscellaneous expense income  net total other income expense profit before income taxes   income tax expense   net earnings    earnings per diluted share consolidated financial results in  net earnings increased to million or per diluted share 
net earnings were impacted by growth in net sales of to million  driven by increases in all three geographic regions north america  europe and other international and all product categories equipment  service  parts and consumables  and floor coatings 
growth in equipment sales was attributable to volume growth  primarily from new products  as well as price increases in certain geographic regions 
gross profit margin improvement of percentage points to 
increases in s a expenses of million primarily resulting from an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense including additional expense resulting from modifications to our management compensation program 
expanded sales and service market coverage  primarily in europe  an increase in bad debt expense  senior management transition costs  higher fuel costs and sarbanes oxley compliance costs also contributed to the increase 
a decrease in the effective tax rate of percentage points to  driven by the resolution of certain state  federal and foreign tax matters 
in  net earnings decreased to million or per diluted share 
net earnings were impacted by growth in net sales of to million partially due to the acquisition of walter broadley which contributed about to net sales and a positive direct foreign exchange impact of approximately 
the balance of the increase was related to growth in north american net sales driven by new product introductions  an improved economy and price increases  including surcharges on certain products  as well as volume growth in our other international markets 
a workforce reduction charge of million after tax million pretax  or per diluted share  related to actions to reduce selling and administrative costs as a part of a continuing effort to improve profitability 
the charge consists primarily of severance and outplacement benefits and is included within s a expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
other increases in s a expenses of million resulting primarily from an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense  an increase in marketing expenses to support product launches in the latter half of  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  increased expenses associated with our expanded market coverage in europe and the inclusion of expenses associated with the acquired operations of walter broadley 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in warranty expense primarily due to improved claims experience and a decrease in expense for specific warranty claims in  as well as benefits from prior restructuring actions 
direct foreign currency effects added approximately million to s a expenses for the year 
we use economic profit as a key indicator of financial performance and the primary metric for performance based incentives 
economic profit is based on our net operating profit after taxes less a charge for the net assets used in the business 
the key drivers of net operating profit we focus on include net sales  gross margin  operating expenses and the effective tax rate 
the key drivers we focus on to measure how effectively we utilize net assets in the business include accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and capital expenditures 
these key drivers are discussed in greater depth throughout management s discussion and analysis 
net sales in  consolidated net sales of million increased from consolidated net sales of million in increased from million in in  growth was driven by increases in all three geographic regions and all product categories 
growth in equipment sales was attributable to volume growth  primarily from new products  as well as price increases in certain geographic regions 
positive direct foreign currency exchange fluctuations  resulting primarily from a weakened us dollar compared to the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and canadian and australian dollars  increased net sales by approximately in and approximately in in  the acquisition of walter broadley in january increased net sales approximately million  or for the year 
the following table sets forth for the years indicated net sales by geography and the related percent change from the prior year dollars in thousands north america   europe    other international    total    north america in  north american net sales increased to million compared with million in growth in net sales was driven by increases in all product categories 
the growth in equipment sales was primarily driven by volume increases from the continued success of new products launched in the latter part of and expanded market coverage as well as price increases 
growth in service and parts and consumables also contributed to the increase in north american net sales when compared to in  north american net sales of million increased compared to growth in net sales was driven by volume increases in equipment sales resulting from a stronger north american economy  new product introductions as well as price increases including surcharges on certain products to help offset the higher cost of steel and other materials 
growth in service and parts and consumables also contributed to the increase in north american net sales when compared to europe european net sales in increased to million compared to this increase was driven by growth in service  parts and consumables and equipment sales 
increases in service and parts and consumables were primarily due to expanded market coverage  while increases in equipment sales were driven by volume increases resulting from new products  price increases and expanded market coverage 
in addition  the shipment of a large order to a new customer in the fourth quarter of contributed about to europe s net sales similar to the large order which occurred in the first quarter of positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased european net sales by approximately in european net sales in were million  up compared to net sales of million 
the acquisition of walter broadley in january added about to europe s net sales growth 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased european net sales by approximately in the shipment of a large order to a new european customer  primarily in the first quarter of  contributed approximately to europe s net sales growth 
other international other international net sales for totaled million  up from overall growth in net sales was primarily driven by volume growth due to new products as well as stronger sales in certain markets resulting from strengthening economies 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased net sales in other international markets by approximately in other international net sales in were million  an increase of over net sales of million 
positive direct foreign currency exchange effects increased net sales in other international markets by approximately in the remaining increase resulted from stronger sales in several international markets primarily driven by stronger local economies as well as new product introductions 
gross profit gross profit margin improved percentage points to 
gross profit margin in was favorably impacted by operating efficiencies including cost reduction actions taken in  improved overhead absorption  and decreased net logistics costs as well as favorable foreign currency exchange 
also contributing to gross margin improvement was a favorable sales mix of products sold  including a higher percentage of direct sales which have higher gross margins 
in addition  price increases implemented in the latter part of and early in have neutralized the impact of higher steel costs that had adversely affected gross margins 
gross profit margin in was compared to in gross profit margin in was unfavorably impacted by the increases in material costs including steel and petroleum based materials and purchased components 
selling price surcharges on certain products in north america were implemented in  which partially mitigated the impact of the increasing material costs on gross profit margins 
the net unfavorable impact was offset by favorable direct foreign currency exchange effects 
future gross profit margins could continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and other product components  competitive market conditions  the mix of products both within and among product lines and geographies  and foreign currency exchange effects 
operating expenses research and development expenses we strive to be the industry leader in innovation and are committed to investing in research and development 
this has been demonstrated through the success of products including readyspace carpet cleaning technology  t series automatic scrubbers  and fast technology 
however  a focus on innovation also carries certain risks that new technology will be slow to be accepted by the marketplace 
management seeks to mitigate this risk through our focus on and commitment to understanding our customers needs and requirements 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to and increased to as a percentage of net sales in research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to  but declined as a percentage of net sales in compared to we expect to maintain our spending on research and development at approximately percent of net sales annually 
selling and administrative expenses s a expenses increased to million from million in the increase in s a expenses was primarily due to an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense  including additional expense resulting from modifications to our management compensation program which discontinued annual employee stock option grants 
our modified program is primarily comprised of performance based shares that are expensed over the performance period instead of stock option grants  for which there is currently no expense 
previously issued but unvested stock options will be expensed beginning in as discussed under new accounting pronouncements 
s a expense also increased in due to expanded sales and service market coverage  primarily in europe  an increase in bad debt expense reflecting increased collection risk for certain customers  senior management transition costs  higher fuel costs for sales and service fleet vehicles and sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
s a expenses increased by million  or  in compared to s a expenses increased partly due to the pretax workforce reduction charge of million discussed previously and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining increase in s a expenses primarily reflects an increase in performance based incentive compensation expense  an increase in marketing expenses to support product launches in the latter half of  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  increased expenses associated with our expanded market coverage in europe and the inclusion of expenses associated with the acquired operations of walter broadley 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in warranty expense primarily due to improved claims experience and a decrease in expense for specific warranty claims in  as well as benefits from prior restructuring actions 
approximately million of the increase in s a expenses is due to direct foreign currency exchange effects 
other income expense the change in other income expense primarily results from a decrease in interest expense due to a reduction in debt outstanding and an increase in interest income  partially offset by an increase in miscellaneous expense due to a million contribution to the tennant foundation 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for the years  and  respectively 
the resolution of certain outstanding state  federal and foreign tax matters favorably impacted the effective tax rate 
in the future  we may experience changes in our effective tax rate based on our ability to utilize the available foreign net operating loss carryforwards and changes in mix of taxable earnings by country 
during each of the past three years  we had a favorable impact from the extraterritorial income exclusion act eti act  a us tax law  of approximately on our effective tax rate 
on october   the american jobs creation act of was signed into law  which will phase out the eti act tax benefit during and in addition  the new law established a manufacturing deduction for profits on us manufactured product to be phased in over six years 
for  the phase out of the eti act tax benefit was substantially offset by the phase in of the us manufacturing deduction 
we expect the impact in will be similar to for to  we expect the change in the us tax law will have a negative impact on our effective tax rate since the eti act is phased out more quickly than the phase in of the us manufacturing deduction 
the american jobs creation act of also had a provision to allow companies to repatriate earnings from their foreign subsidiaries at a favorable tax rate 
we do not plan to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources during  our financial condition continued to strengthen 
our debt to total capital ratio was at december   compared with at december  at december   our capital structure was comprised of million of current debt  million of long term debt and million of shareholders equity 
as of december   we had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling million  with terms generally one year or less  and a million letter of credit outstanding 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million at december   up from million as of december  approximately million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries 
wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed 
our current ratio was at december   and at december   based on working capital of million and million  respectively 
if the global economy deteriorates  it could have an unfavorable impact on the demand for our products and  as a result  our operating cash flow 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  present capital resources and available financing sources are more than sufficient to meet cash requirements for our contractual cash obligations and commitments at december   are summarized in the following table in thousands total after on balance sheet obligations notes payable capital leases    residual value guarantee total on balance sheet obligations    off balance sheet arrangements operating leases     purchase obligations    total off balance sheet obligations     total contractual obligations     on balance sheet obligations our debt obligations totaling million as of december   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  are primarily comprised of capital lease obligations  collateralized borrowings and notes payable 
cash obligations in the table above do not include obligations associated with our collateralized borrowings as these transactions represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions in europe accounted for as borrowings under sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas no 

we do not expect to have to fund these obligations 
in addition  we have other long term liabilities on the balance sheet which represent our obligations associated with long term employee benefit arrangements  primarily retirement benefit plans and unfunded deferred compensation arrangements 
our retirement benefit plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations 
as a result  these obligations  which totaled million as of december   are not included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
we expect to contribute approximately million in total to our us retiree  us nonqualified  uk pension and the german pension plans in we do not expect that a contribution will be required to our us pension plan for the foreseeable future 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled million as of december  we expect to distribute approximately million of this obligation in we cannot predict the timing or amounts of the remaining obligation as it is dependent upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections 
our remaining long term employee benefit arrangements are comprised of long term incentive compensation arrangements with certain key management  foreign defined contribution plans and other long term arrangements totaling million 
we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments associated with these arrangements  as a result  these obligations are not included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating lease commitments for office and warehouse facilities  vehicles and office equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements as well as unconditional purchase commitments 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  these obligations are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
unconditional purchase obligations include purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business and contractual purchase commitments 
during july  we amended our purchase commitment with a third party manufacturer to extend the terms of the agreement from september to september the remaining commitment under this agreement totaled million as of december  this purchase commitment has been included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table along with purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we have a cancellation clause with our third party logistics provider which would require payment of a cancellation fee in the event we elect to cancel the agreement prior to the contract expiration date 
this fee  which approximated million at december   declines on a straight line basis through in addition  in the event that we elect to cancel the agreement  we would be required to assume the underlying building lease for the remainder of its term 
we have applied the provisions of eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and have determined that our agreement with our third party logistics provider contains an operating lease under sfas no 
as a result  we have included the future minimum lease payments related to the underlying building lease in our operating lease commitments in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions  which would become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value 
of those leases that contain residual value guarantees  the aggregate residual value at lease expiration is million  of which we have guaranteed million 
as of december   we have recorded a liability for the fair value of this residual value guarantee of million 
cash requirements operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the cash provided by operating activities in was impacted by strong net earnings and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues 
the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenues was primarily attributable to higher accruals for annual performance based incentive payments and timing of payments 
partially offsetting these sources of cash was an increase in receivables and a decrease in other current noncurrent assets and liabilities 
the increase in receivables was driven by higher fourth quarter sales volumes while the decrease in other current noncurrent assets and liabilities was primarily due to a large  lump sum payment of deferred compensation in in  cash provided from operating activities was impacted by a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by an increase in receivables 
the decrease in inventories is primarily attributable to actions associated with inventory reduction initiatives 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue increased primarily due to the timing of payments and higher accruals for annual performance based incentive payments  rebates and the workforce reduction charge 
the increase in receivables was a result of higher fourth quarter sales volumes 
as discussed previously  two metrics used by management to evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets are accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and days inventory on hand dioh  on a fifo basis 
these metrics for the years indicated were as follows in days dioh dso the improvement in dioh of days in reflects a continued focus on inventory reduction initiatives and the introduction of lean manufacturing principles 
this follows an improvement in dioh of days in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in cash used in investing activities in was driven by capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from disposition of property  plant and equipment and sales of short term investments 
capital expenditures were million during compared to million in capital expenditures in included investments in new product tooling and expansion of our information system capabilities 
capital expenditures in were higher than expenditures of million primarily due to the installation of a new powder paint system and the purchase of additional system components to provide a platform to expand the capabilities of our information systems 
proceeds from dispositions of property  plant and equipment in include million in proceeds from the sale of a distribution center in holland  michigan 
in  capital spending is expected to approximate to million 
significant capital projects planned for include continued expansion of our information systems capabilities and investments in new product tooling as well as china expansion initiatives 
capital expenditures in are expected to be financed primarily with funds from operations 
in january  we acquired all of the stock of walter broadley for million in the form of cash and debt as well as assuming million in outstanding debt  of which million was immediately retired 
the cost of the acquisition was paid for in cash with funds provided by operations 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  significant uses of cash included a million scheduled debt repayment and million in repurchases of common stock related to our share repurchase program 
during  million of assumed walter broadley debt was repaid 
in  proceeds from issuance of common stock were million driven by employee stock option exercises due to an increase in our stock price and senior management transitions during the year 
cash dividends increased for the th consecutive year to per share in  an increase of per share over in november  an additional  shares were authorized under the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in may shares repurchased during  and approximated   and  respectively 
the average repurchase price was during  during and during at december   approximately  shares were authorized for repurchase 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments at the time of issuance 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
the effect of the standard will be to require entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock awards based on its grant date fair value and to recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide services for the award 
we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january   as required  using the modified prospective transition method for our existing stock based compensation plans 
under the modified prospective transition method  the fair value based accounting method will be used for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the adoption date 
compensation cost related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
under this method  we estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in approximately million to million of stock based compensation expense in related to stock options  including reload grants 
beginning in  we modified our management compensation program replacing annual employee stock option awards with performance based share awards 
during  compensation expense under this program was recognized over the performance period  with adjustments to expense for changes in the market price of tennant stock and for the actual achievement against established targets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r in january  compensation expense associated with these performance based share awards will be fixed at the grant date fair value of the award and recognized over the remaining performance period based on actual achievement against performance targets 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of net sales were in and in and as of december   we had million reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
our reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory is based on inventory levels  expected product lives and forecasted sales demand 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed according to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded and adjusted as a part of our cycle counting and physical inventory procedures 
the reserve amount is based on historical loss trends  historical physical and cycle count adjustments as well as inventory levels 
changes in the reserve result from the completed cycle counts and physical inventories 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 
deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future tax impact of temporary differences between book and taxable income 
deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance and income tax charge are recorded when  in management s judgment  realization of a specific deferred tax asset is less likely than not 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance for foreign tax loss carryforwards at december   was million

it is not possible to anticipate or foresee all risk factors  and investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive or complete list of all risks or uncertainties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
in  we will also begin to have a foreign currency exchange impact related to the chinese yuan 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of approximately million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel or oil and gas 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation  weather related factors and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  our freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
during  our purchased material and other costs were unfavorably impacted by higher oil and gas prices
