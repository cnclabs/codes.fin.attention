financial overview we reported a net income of million for the year  as compared to a net income of million in the decrease in net income of million was mainly due to a million reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance in december for  we reversed the remaining million balance of our deferred tax valuation allowance  resulting in a net provision for income taxes of million 
both reversals were due to our positive outlook regarding our expected profitability in the coming years 
the reversal was also caused by the change in new jersey tax law that allows a full deduction for net operating loss carryovers beginning in income from operations amounted to million in as compared to million in  an increase of million or in  as compared to the increase in sales combined with a point decrease in our gross margin percentage resulted in an increase in gross profit of million 
we invested million in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses to achieve this growth 
the company s sales  gross profit and results of operations have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the condition of the software industry in general  shifts in demand for software products  industry shipments of new software products or upgrades  the timing of new merchandise and catalog offerings  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in postage  paper  shipping and printing costs and in merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect response  distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays  and changes in the company s product offerings

if revenues do not meet expectations in any given quarter  operating results may be materially adversely affected

gross margin as a percentage of net sales has consistently decreased in the last several years 
this is a result of the strong demand for our core products that typically have lower margins 
on a forward looking basis  gross profit margin in future periods may be less than that achieved in we have several initiatives to increase gross margin percentages  including increased management control over pricing  a focus on high margin products and or markets and selling services 
however  we do not expect these initiatives to have an immediate positive impact on our gross margin percentages 
the objective of these initiatives is to slow the decline in our gross margin percentage 
we foresee possible pressure on gross profit margins as a result of various factors  including the continued participation by vendors in inventory price protection and rebate programs  product mix  including software maintenance and third party services  pricing strategies  market conditions and other factors  any of which could result in a reduction of gross profit margins below those realized in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses for were million as compared to million for  an increase of million or

facility related expenses increased by million as a result of the opening of the satellite sales office in hauppauge  new york 
page of the remaining million was mainly related to a bad debt expense of  as the result of a bankruptcy filing by amherst technologies  llc 
on a forward looking basis  we do not expect to increase our sg a expenses significantly 
we have several initiatives in place to actually increase control over sg a expenses 
our sg a expenses have increased over on a yearly basis for the last two years 
the objective of these initiatives is to slow this continued increase in sg a expenses

for the year ended december   the company recorded a net deferred tax benefit in the amount of million dollars related to a reversal of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance
