management discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  impairment of intangible assets  including goodwill  and valuation of deferred tax assets  which are summarized below 
in addition  note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company provides services under time and materials  cost reimbursable  and fixed price including fixed fee per transaction contracts to both government and commercial customers 
each contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  requiring the company to make judgments and estimates about recognizing revenue 
revenue is recognized as services are performed 
under time and materials contracts  as well as certain government cost reimbursable and certain fixed price contracts  the contractual billing schedules are based on the specified level of resources the company is obligated to provide 
as a result  for these level of effort contracts  the contractual billing amount for the period is a measure of performance and  therefore  revenue is recognized in that amount 
revenue under government fixed price and certain commercial contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimated costs 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  the estimated losses are recognized immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenues and costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and anticipated changes in estimated salaries and other costs 
estimates of total contract revenues and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
when revisions in estimated contract revenues and costs are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
for commercial fixed fee per transaction contracts  revenue is recognized during the period in which services are delivered in accordance with the pricing outlined in the contracts 
for other commercial fixed price contracts which typically involve a discrete project  such as development of training content and materials  design of training processes  software implementation  or engineering projects  the contractual billing schedules are not based on the specified level of resources the company is obligated to provide 
these discrete projects generally do not contain milestones or other reliable measures of performance 
as a result  revenue on these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract 
the company believes this methodology is a reasonable measure of proportional performance since performance primarily involves personnel costs and services are provided to the customer throughout the course of the projects through regular communications of progress toward completion and other project deliverables 
in addition  the customer typically is required to pay the company for the proportionate amount of work and cost incurred in the event of contract termination 
certain of the company s fixed price commercial contracts contain revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company applies the separation guidance in emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  for these types of contracts 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables can be divided into more than one unit of accounting 
for contracts determined to have more than one unit of accounting  the company recognizes revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above  that is  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with work performed and costs incurred  with fee being allocated proportionately over the service period 
within each multiple deliverable project  there is objective and reliable fair value across all units of the arrangement  as discounts are not offered or applied to one deliverable versus another  and the rates bid across all deliverables are consistent 
as part of the company s on going operations to provide services to its customers  incidental expenses  which are commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses  are billed to customers  either directly as a pass through cost or indirectly as a cost estimated in proposing on fixed price contracts 
out of pocket expenses include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals and telecommunication charges 
the company s policy provides for these expenses to be recorded as both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
valuation of accounts receivable provisions for allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on specific collection risks identified by the company 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of the historical loss experience of the company and its subsidiaries  judgments about customer credit risk and the need to adjust for current economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  impairment of intangible assets  including goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the goodwill impairment test requires the company to identify its reporting units as defined in sfas no 
and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
the company uses a third party valuation firm to estimate the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
these estimates are formed by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
for the years ended december    and  the estimated fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their respective carrying values  indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the estimated fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any reporting unit below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this would require a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the reporting unit s goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon these factors  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance relates to both foreign and domestic net operating loss carryforwards for which the company does not believe the benefits will be realized 
as of december   the company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire during and accounting standards issued we discuss recently issued accounting standards in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs internal processes to manage its exposure to interest rate  market risks and currency fluctuations 
the company s objective in managing its interest rate risk is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company estimates that the fair value of its long term debt approximates its carrying amount as the stated interest rates approximate prevailing market rates 
the company is exposed to the impact of currency fluctuations because of its international operations 
the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiaries  including intercompany balances  at december  was not significant  and accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency do not have a material impact on the company s financial position 
the company s revenues and profitability are related to general levels of economic activity and employment in the united states and the united kingdom 
as a result  any significant economic downturn or recession in one or both of those countries could harm our business and financial condition 
a significant portion of the company s revenues is derived from fortune level companies and their international equivalents  which historically have adjusted expenditures for external training during economic downturns 
if the economies in which these companies operate weaken in any future period  these companies may not increase or may reduce their expenditures on external training  which could adversely affect the company s business and financial condition
