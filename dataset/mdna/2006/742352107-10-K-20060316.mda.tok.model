item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the princeton review provides educational products and services to students  parents  educators and educational institutions 
these products and services include integrated classroom based and online instruction  professional development for teachers and educators  print and online materials and lessons  and higher education marketing and admissions management 
we operate our businesses through three divisions  which correspond to our business segments 
the test preparation services division derives the majority of its revenue from classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses and tutoring services 
additionally  test preparation services receives royalties from its independent franchises who provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand 
since  this division has also been providing ses programs to students in public school districts 
this division has historically accounted for the majority of our overall revenue and accounted for approximately of our overall revenue in the test preparation services division s revenue increased from levels 
during  the fastest growing areas for this division were its ses courses  sales of which have increased in response to the increased emphasis on state assessments  and institutional sales  which is partially attributed to the new sat test introduced in tutoring and retail classroom revenues also contributed to the overall growth in this division 
the k services division provides a number of services to k schools and school districts  including assessment  professional development  intervention materials workbooks and related products and face to face instruction 
as a result of the increased emphasis on accountability and the measurement of student performance in public schools in this country and the centralization of school districts purchasing of assessment  professional development and supplemental educational products and services  this division continues to see growing demand by the public school market for its products 
during k services introduced its sidestreets after school intervention materials 
we believe this material will allow us to be more responsive to school districts needs and less reliant on providing custom made content 
the k services division experienced revenue growth of  as compared to levels 
as this division has grown over the last several years  we have begun to enter into more and more large  multiple element contracts with schools  school districts  municipal agencies  and other governmental bodies  requiring us to deliver a combination of products and services  including online and print based assessment  professional development  and face to face instruction 
the approval processes of some of our customers in this area  which are required for formal contract execution  are lengthy and cumbersome 
these contracts therefore present several types of risks and uncertainties  including reducing our ability to effectively predict our operating performance  increasing variability in our cash balances and increasing credit risk 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail under the heading risk factors in this form k 
while we see continued strong revenue growth in this division  operating results are difficult to predict accurately  due to the foregoing factors and the fact that each contract entered into by this division has its own  unique product mix 
because our various products in this division have different gross margins professional development and live course instruction products typically have lower gross margins than fees for assessment products and printed materials  contracts with varying product mix could significantly alter this division s operating results from period to period 
primarily due to changes in product mix  gross margins in this division declined from in to in our admissions services division currently derives most of its revenue from the sale of web based admissions and application management products and marketing services to educational institutions 
in  this division represented of our overall revenue 
in  the division s performance was again below management s expectations  primarily due to a lack of increase in demand for subscription based admissions and application management services 
for the third consecutive year  revenue in this division did not grow appreciably over the prior year 
we are currently in the process of refocusing this division s overall direction  with the goal of changing the way we charge post secondary academic institutions for our marketing services 
we are moving from a model of pricing for various bundles of marketing services  to a model where payment is based upon actual leads we generate 
we believe this model will allow us to better capitalize on the popularity of our web site with college and graduate school bound students 
to support this change in our marketing services model  we re launched our web site with a view to optimizing our ability to match the right prospects with the post secondary institutions looking to attract them 
additionally  we expanded our counseling services in this division by signing a multi year contract with several schools in texas 
we believe that we will need to further increase revenues before this division will show sustainable operating profits  and it is management s hope that this new direction of providing lead generation and college counseling services will provide the needed momentum to do so 
revenue test preparation services 
the test preparation services division derives revenue primarily from classroom based and online test preparation courses and tutoring services  which consists of tuition and fees paid to our company operated sites 
we recognize revenue from tuition paid for our courses over the life of the course  which is usually from five to weeks depending on the course type

income taxes as a result of the effect under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  on the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets  we decided to record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax benefits 
in  a deferred tax benefit of million was offset by a further valuation allowance of the same amount  resulting in no net tax expense in during  as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets we recorded an income tax expense of million for income tax expense was million for our effective income tax rate was for  for  and for we currently have significant deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that will reduce taxable income in future years 
our loss in and and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represents sufficient evidence under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
although management expects these assets will ultimately be fully utilized  future performance cannot be assured 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in future periods 
results of operations three months ended december  compared to three months ended december revenue for the three months ended december  total revenue for the company increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is driven by an increase of million in retail  institutional and tutoring revenue  reflecting strong enrollment in sat  lsat  and mcat courses and an increase of million in ses revenue 
k services revenue increased by  or  from million in to million in this increase is primarily driven by million of growth in assessment services and the receipt of  in prior year license fees

the key drivers of this reduction relate to  in revenue credits driving approximately of the decline  as well as approximately in consulting mix and another attributed to the cost base

sale of rights to franchises during the third quarter of  we sold the right to provide ses programs to four of our independent franchisees for  comparison of years ended december  and overall  results for were below expectations in all three divisions 
after returning to profitability in  we incurred a net loss of million in in the test preparation services division  weakness in enrollments in lsat and gmat courses offset growth in online courses  ses programs and tutoring  resulting in annual revenue growth of only 
despite revenue growth for the year of  the k services division experienced a longer sales cycle in closing on contracts 
the admissions services division  despite rolling out a new counseling product  failed to grow revenue for the second year in a row  primarily due to weak demand for subscription based services from its post secondary institution customers 
gross margins for the company as a whole slipped from in to in  due primarily to higher costs combined with lower enrollment in test preparation services and a less profitable product mix in k services 
on the expense side  professional fees  including those relating to sarbanes oxley compliance  were significantly higher than expected  and a bad debt expense relating to the write off of aged accounts receivable in the admissions services and k services divisions further hurt our bottom line 
additionally  we recorded a valuation allowance relating to our net deferred tax assets as of december   of approximately million  resulting in a tax charge of million in  and incurred an million impairment charge relating to the write down of goodwill 
revenue our total revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
test preparation services revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  comprised primarily of an increase of approximately million in revenue from our company owned operations 
the increased revenue from company owned operations resulted from an increase of approximately  in revenue attributable to the operations acquired from our former franchisee  princeton review of north carolina  inc  and an increase of approximately million in course and tutoring revenue at our other locations 
this million increase is attributable to an increase in our tutoring  online course and ses revenue totaling million  which was partially offset by a decrease in retail classroom revenue of approximately million  primarily due to a drop in lsat and gmat course fees 
k services revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
this increase resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in revenue from schools for assessment tests  printed materials  professional development and homeroom subscriptions  due to additional contracts signed in  as well as increased revenue from contracts signed in which were in effect for the full year in the increase in revenue from schools was partially offset by a decrease in fees from mcgraw hill 
admissions services revenue decreased from million in to million in  representing a decrease 
the approximate  in sales of college counseling services to high schools  a new product offering in by this division  was offset by a decrease in revenues from post secondary institutions 
cost of revenue our total cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
test preparation services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  primarily as a result of increasing the number of tutoring sessions and ses programs delivered 
cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased due to reduction in the average class size due to reduced enrollment  primarily in our lsat courses  as well as an increase in the relative cost of teachers and course materials 
k services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in costs incurred to service increasing numbers and increasingly complex contracts with school based customers 
the percentage increase in cost of revenue was significantly higher than the increase in revenue in this division primarily because of the increased revenues from the lower margin professional development services 
admissions services cost of revenue increased from million in to million in  representing a increase  primarily due to increased customer support costs  including the new high school counseling product 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  representing a increase 
this increase resulted from the following a write down of goodwill related to the acquisition of embark of approximately million  an increase of approximately million in salaries and payroll taxes  resulting primarily from increased headcount  an increase of approximately million attributable primarily to personnel related costs  including office rent and expenses  travel and entertainment  employee benefits and recruiting fees  an increase of approximately million in professional fees  comprised primarily of legal  accounting and consultant fees  relating to sarbanes oxley compliance  an internal corporate reorganization and other miscellaneous matters  an increase of approximately million in web site technology and development expenses  an increase of approximately million in bad debt allowance expense primarily due to an increase in aged accounts receivable in the admissions services and k services divisions  and an increase of approximately  in depreciation and amortization expenses  due primarily to increased amortization expense relating to the k services division s web site development costs 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand and collections from customers 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
the million decrease in cash from the december  balance is primarily attributed to investing activities of million million in furniture  fixtures  equipment and software development and million in capitalized content along with million related to financing activity that more than offset the million cash increase provided by operating activities 
our test preparation services division has historically generated  and continues to generate  the largest portion of our cash flow from its retail classroom and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs 
increasingly  however  across all of our divisions  we are generating a greater percentage of our cash from contracts with institutions such as the schools and school districts serviced by our k services division and the post secondary institutions serviced by our admissions services division  all of which pay us in arrears 
typical payment performance for these institutional customers  once invoiced  ranges from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles and or delays in purchase order generation with some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts 
cash provided by operating activities is our net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for  an increase of million 
the increase is primarily attributed to the year over year increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in deferred income of million and an increase in inventory  primarily sidestreets instruction books  of million during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million used during this increase is driven by increases of million in capital expenditures due primarily to the oracle implementation  an increase of million in content expenditures related to the development of sidestreets content and an increase of million in leasehold improvements 
financing cash flows consist primarily of transactions related to our debt and equity structure 
we used approximately million in compared to net proceeds of million during during  we repaid approximately million of the debt we had borrowed in under a bank credit facility  and we repaid approximately million in other debt 
in  we raised approximately million net of issuance costs  from the sale of series b preferred stock and repaid approximately million of other debt 
our current cash balances and operating cash flow  will be sufficient to cover our normal operating requirements for the next months as we implement a number of restructuring initiatives designed to significantly improve operating cash flow 
we also expect to shortly secure a revolving line of credit in an amount of million to million to support any further working capital requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our long term office and classroom leases  obligations under promissory notes entered into in connection with acquisitions  employment agreements and several capital leases of computer equipment 
as of december   we operated from leased premises in new york  alabama  arizona  california  colorado  georgia  illinois  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  missouri  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  south carolina  texas  virginia  washington  washington dc  and canada 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments set forth therein as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations consist of payments required under employment agreements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas r  only the pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic share based payment which addresses the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sfas r is effective for our first quarter of and the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is expected to result in pre tax stock based compensation expense of between million and million in our fiscal year in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
sfas amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb  that was issued in the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  apb required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset  or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset  should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions of sfas were effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   and there was no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year and is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the estimates  methods and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective and difficult judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairment expense  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margins when we record the impairment of assets or accelerate their depreciation  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision and  to a lesser extent  revenue recognition requirements  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we review our aged receivables monthly 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for uncollectible accounts if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill and territorial marketing rights 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
no impairment was indicated in or in  we recorded an impairment expense of million against goodwill in our admissions services division due to the continued poor performance of this division 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
income taxes 
in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  primarily relating to our net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in varying amounts between and realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the united states prior to expiration of these loss carryforwards 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset because our loss in and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represented sufficient evidence under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in general our revenue recognition policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective  with the possible exception being the recognition of revenue for separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue for each product or service by each of the segments 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
however  as ses revenues increase  we expect to recognize these revenues primarily in the first and fourth quarters 
the electronic application revenue recorded in our admissions services division is highest in the first and fourth quarters  corresponding with the busiest times of year for submission of applications to academic institutions 
our k services division experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenue  with the first and fourth quarters corresponding to the school year expected to have the highest revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our portfolio of marketable securities includes primarily short term money market funds 
the fair value of our portfolio of marketable securities would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due primarily to the short term nature of the portfolio 
all of our currently outstanding long term debt bears interest at fixed rates
