genelabs technologies  inc  referred to as genelabs or the company  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of pharmaceutical products to improve human health 
the company has built drug discovery capabilities that can support various research and development projects 
the company is currently concentrating these capabilities on discovering novel compounds that selectively inhibit replication of the hepatitis c virus  or hcv  and advancing preclinical development of compounds from this hepatitis c virus drug discovery program  while also exploring options for development of a late stage product for lupus 
a number of key events impacted the business of genelabs during beginning with drug discovery  we expanded our research capacity and capability by hiring additional scientists 
we have focused our hiring activities on our hcv polymerase non nucleoside drug discovery program and a separate effort focused on a target encoded by the nsa region of the hcv genome 
in addition  we continued our work on the hcv nucleoside program in collaboration with gilead sciences  inc  or gilead 
in the non nucleoside program we completed one and seven day toxicology studies in two rodent species on two different non nucleoside compounds from separate chemical families 
based on the results of these studies  we contracted with an outside manufacturer to perform scale up synthesis and production of additional quantities of the compounds which would enable further toxicology and other studies necessary to file an investigational new drug  or ind  application in the united states 
depending on resource constraints and test results  the company may proceed with scale up manufacturing of one  both or neither of the preclinical compounds 
if the manufacturing proceeds smoothly and the requisite tests are conducted efficiently with positive results  the company believes that it may file an ind or similar application during there can be no assurance that manufacturing and testing will be successful or that the company will file an ind within such time frame 
in drug development  we focused on defining possible paths forward for our investigational drug for women with lupus  prestara tm 
patients who completed our phase iii clinical trial  designated study gl  were eligible to enroll in a month open label continuation study which was designated study gl this follow on trial assessed the effect of prestara on bone mineral density of the study gl participants over an additional months 
preliminary results of study gl indicated that patients who received mg of prestara per day increased their bone mineral density  or bmd  at the lumbar spine by approximately during the months they were enrolled in study gl results of study gl also indicated that patients who received a lower dose of prestara  mg per day  did not increase their bmd during the clinical trial  and in fact lost a measurable amount of bmd at the lumbar spine over the month period of study gl the safety profile for prestara in this study was consistent with that seen in previous clinical studies 
after learning these results  we had a meeting with the fda for the purpose of determining the future development path for prestara 
in the meeting the fda informed us that we would need additional positive clinical trial data before they would consider reviewing a new drug application for prestara  and they indicated that one additional  positive clinical trial could suffice for an indication of treating the signs and symptoms of lupus 
going forward  we intend to pursue an indication for treating the signs and symptoms of lupus rather than the bone density indication we had pursued since we are presently in the process of designing a prospective clinical trial of prestara for lupus  measuring the signs and symptoms of lupus  although we presently do not have the resources to conduct this trial on our own  and we may decide to discontinue further development of prestara 
effective october   our common stock trading was transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq capital market  which was formerly known as the nasdaq smallcap market 
on december  we 
table of contents implemented a one for five reverse split of our common stock  and on january   nasdaq sent us notification that we had re gained compliance with their minimum closing bid price requirement 
on march   genelabs had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately million  which we expect can sustain existing operations only into the beginning of the fourth quarter of as a result  there is substantial doubt as to the ability of genelabs to continue as a going concern absent a substantial increase in cash from a new corporate partnership or sale of equity securities 
in addition  genelabs does not currently satisfy the listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market  requiring a minimum shareholder s equity balance or market capitalization level  which could result in the delisting of genelabs from that exchange 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting estimates which are important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations as presented in the financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees where we continue involvement through a collaboration or other obligation is referred to as unearned contract revenue and classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
we amortize unearned contract revenue into contract revenue on the statement of operations over the research or development period instead of recognizing it into income immediately upon receipt 
we base the amortization period for each agreement on our estimate of the period we have significant obligations under the contract 
we continually review the basis for our estimates  and we may change the estimates if circumstances change 
these changes can significantly increase or decrease the amount of revenue recognized in the financial statements 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the revenue among the deliverables based on objective and reliable evidence of each deliverable s fair value 
unearned contract revenue at december  was from three different sources 
genelabs management considers the amortization periods for each of the up front payments as critical accounting estimates 
at december   the largest component of unearned contract revenue was related to an up front payment from gilead sciences  inc under a research collaboration and license agreement we entered into in when the agreement was signed we received an up front payment of million that we are amortizing over a four year period from the effective date of the collaboration 
the four year period is based on the initial three year term of our research obligations to gilead plus an additional one year extension  which is at gilead s sole option 
as of december   million of unearned contract revenue was related to the up front payment received from gilead  of which million was classified as current 
in addition to the up front payment  gilead is also obligated to pay us on going research funding 
at december   genelabs also has unearned contract revenue aggregating million related to two separate agreements for prestara  genelabs investigational drug for lupus 
we classified as current approximately million of the unearned contract revenue for these agreements 
we amortize the two up front payments we received over the estimated development terms for prestara for the territories covered by each of the agreements 
genelabs management believes that its significant obligations under the agreements extend to the time when regulatory decisions are made to approve prestara in the key licensed territory  if prestara were to be approved  or until further development of prestara is terminated 
for each of the agreements related to prestara  genelabs is amortizing the unearned contract revenue through december  in all of the agreements for which we have recorded deferred revenue  the estimated period for amortization has an important impact on the revenue we recognize  and  in turn  on the net loss we report in our financial statements 
for example  if longer terms were estimated our revenue would be lower and our net loss would be higher 
conversely  if a shorter amortization term were estimated  our revenue would be greater and the net loss lower 
we regularly assess the remaining terms over which the up front payments are being recognized into the statement of operations and  if appropriate  make changes based on updated information 
for example  in we lengthened the amortization period for the unearned contract revenue related to the agreement with watson pharmaceuticals after our us clinical trial  study gl  for prestara did not succeed in meeting its clinical 
table of contents endpoints 
the failure of the clinical trial to meet its endpoints resulted in a longer period of time for us to potentially receive approval of prestara  and our best current estimate is that it may now take until the end of our estimate is based on the need for another clinical trial to obtain approval 
however  because we have not completed the protocol and we have not received agreement from the fda on the specific trial  the estimates are highly subjective and may change in the future once we have more information and are able to better determine our plans for future development of prestara 
we have assessed the remaining term over which each of the up front payments are being recognized into the statement of operations  and believe we are using the most appropriate terms based on the facts known to us as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k 
however  actions taken by the fda  decisions made by our collaborators or other changes in circumstances after the filing of this annual report on form k may either reduce or lengthen the remaining period over which genelabs records unearned contract revenue into the statement of operations 
accounting for employee stock options 
as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  referred to as sfas  we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option plans 
accordingly  to date we generally have accounted for employee stock options based on their intrinsic value and have not recognized compensation expense for employee options granted at fair market value or higher 
in the notes to our financial statements we separately disclose the pro forma effects on reported net loss and loss per share as if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method of accounting using the black scholes option pricing model 
in valuing our options for this disclosure  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the options 
genelabs management believes that these estimates are subjective  and notes that changes in any of these assumptions  particularly the volatility assumption  would increase or decrease the accounting value of the option and correspondingly increase or decrease the pro forma effect on the disclosures of reported net loss and loss per share under the fair value method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas r  superseding previous accounting rules covering stock options issued to employees 
we are adopting sfas r effective january  under sfas r  we will record compensation expense for stock options issued to employees based on an estimate of the fair value of the options when they are issued  and we are implementing this new standard using the modified prospective transition method 
the stock option valuation assumptions permitted under sfas r are different than those contained in sfas and we are in the final stages of determining the assumptions that we will use for options we grant in and thereafter 
sfas r will materially increase our operating expenses and our net loss 
results of operations years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  a decrease of million from the million net loss in this decrease in net loss was primarily the result of lower research and development costs and higher contract revenue  partially offset by a gain on the sale of a discontinued operation 
a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 

table of contents revenue 
revenues were million in and million in the following table breaks down revenue by major source in thousands contract revenue hcv drug discovery research collaboration gilead sciences  inc prestara collaborations watson pharmaceuticals  inc and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
linker aided dna amplification license fee affymetrix  inc hepatitis e vaccine milestone glaxosmithkline data analysis services total contract revenue royalties total revenue in  our most significant source of revenue was from our collaboration with gilead sciences  inc the agreement with gilead that we entered into during has a three year initial research term  with gilead having an option to extend for one additional year 
upon signing the agreement we received an million up front payment  and we are entitled to receive quarterly payments aggregating approximately million over the initial three year term as we work with gilead to discover additional nucleoside compounds that inhibit replication of hcv 
if gilead exercises its option to extend the research term by one year  additional payments would be due to genelabs 
we recognized contract revenue of million under the gilead agreement in  comprised of million in research funding and million for the pro rata share of the up front license fee 
the revenue recognized during was greater than that recognized in because the agreement was in place for all of compared to only one quarter of in we recognized million in revenue from our two collaborations for the development and commercialization of prestara 
these are with watson pharmaceuticals inc for north america and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
for japan 
in  our revenue related to prestara decreased by million compared to primarily due to a lengthening of the term we estimate it could take us to potentially obtain approval of prestara in the united states 
our lengthening of the estimated term to potentially receive approval in the united states was made based on negative clinical trial results received in  and our determination that approval would not be possible by the previous time through which we were recognizing revenue 
for both agreements related to prestara  we presently are amortizing the up front payments through the end of the amortization for both agreements could change in the future based on the clinical trial design  the status of our ability to initiate a clinical trial  and discussions with our corporate partners  among other things 
during  we did not recognize revenue related to our linker aided dna amplification licenses or our hepatitis e vaccine agreement with glaxosmithkline because we did not receive any payments 
in late we ceased providing data analysis services to other parties  and accordingly did not record or receive any revenue during in addition  we receive royalties from other parties which aggregated approximately million in  compared to million in operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs in our financial statements in thousands 
change research and development general and administrative total operating expenses 
table of contents all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
the two key decreases in operating expenses for compared to were lower costs resulting from our completion of all clinical work on prestara for lupus and lower costs incurred for our employees incentive bonuses  which were partially offset by increased costs on our hepatitis c virus drug discovery research 
these are each explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses background we are in the business of drug discovery and development and have not developed any products that have been approved for sale 
because the majority of our costs are directly related to discovering and developing new drugs  we classify these costs as research and development and expense them as they are incurred 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for employees directly involved in these activities  supplies and chemicals used in laboratories  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract and outside service fees  and allocated facilities and overhead costs 
over the last several years the majority of genelabs research and development activities have been focused on two key areas the discovery of entirely new drugs and the development of prestara tm for lupus 
following a clinical trial that did not meet its endpoint in late  the work related to prestara decreased throughout research and development expenses by project in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major category in thousands change drug discovery hepatitis c virus  or hcv drug development prestara tm support costs and other research and development total research and development drug discovery costs for our drug discovery program increased to million in from million in drug discovery costs were higher in than in due to our significant expansion of the program beginning in the latter half of  which continued throughout  with most of our hiring of new employees occurring during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as of december   our research headcount increased by over the amount at the end of costs increased as a result of increased personnel and a greater usage of chemicals and lab supplies used by the scientists 
the percentage increase in costs in compared to was greater than the percentage increase in headcount during due to the timing of hiring in late combined with the hiring of more scientists with advanced degrees such as ph 
d s 
in addition  since we do not have full preclinical development capabilities in our own laboratories  in we required additional outside lab services as our compounds advanced within preclinical development 
the increase in hcv drug discovery costs in also included the addition of a new program  using hcv nsa as a drug target  and further work on the programs targeting the hcv polymerase  including identification of additional potent compounds and the advancement of another one of these to preclinical development status 
since initiating our first drug discovery program in  genelabs has built medicinal chemistry  combinatorial chemistry  computational modeling  molecular biology  assay development and high throughput screening  drug metabolism  pharmacokinetics and toxicology capabilities 
genelabs has incurred direct drug discovery costs of approximately million through december  of this amount  million relates to our hcv drug discovery programs which began in early during  substantially all of our drug discovery efforts were directed toward three separate hepatitis c virus research programs  which are concentrated on identifying a new drug to combat infection with hcv 
two of these programs target the hcv nsb rna dependent rna polymerase the enzyme directly responsible for replication of the hcv genome  although through different mechanisms 
we refer to one of these mechanisms as our nucleoside program and we refer to the other as the non nucleoside program 
our third hcv drug discovery program targets 
table of contents the hcv nsa protein  a different viral enzyme that is also required for viral replication 
part of our drug discovery process includes continued testing of our preclinical drug candidates and identification of additional potential lead compounds 
due to the nature of drug discovery research  we cannot reliably estimate the outcome of scientific experiments  many of which will impact the design and conduct of subsequent scientific experiments  and all of which provide additional information on both the direction of the research program and likelihood of its success 
as such  the potential timing for key future events that may occur in our drug discovery programs cannot reliably be estimated and we cannot estimate whether a compound will advance to a later stage of development or when we may determine that a program is no longer viable for potentially producing a drug candidate 
we also cannot reasonably predict the costs to reach these stages  and cannot predict whether any of our compounds will result in commercial products or lead to revenue for the company 
going forward into  we believe both of our hcv polymerase targeted programs  nucleoside and non nucleoside  are staffed at appropriate levels to address our objectives 
we believe that  as we continue advancement of the preclinical candidates in the non nucleoside program  our external costs will increase as we rely on outside sources to manufacture the drug material and conduct studies 
in  subject to receipt of additional funding  we also plan to expand work on our newest hcv drug discovery program  targeting the nsa protein  and intend to explore other drug targets as potential programs  if our financial resources allow 
however  the resources available to us  outcomes of current and planned scientific experiments and outcomes of corporate partnering discussions may cause us to revise this estimate 
management continually evaluates the status of our drug discovery research programs and expects to continue to devote resources toward these efforts  while at the same time managing the level of expenditures to balance limited cash resources and the various drug discovery and development opportunities 
drug development prestara tm costs for prestara decreased to million in compared to million in  a reduction of over as we completed a phase iii clinical trial in the third quarter of  completed a follow on open label trial in the third quarter of and significantly decreased the staff working on the program 
genelabs began developing prestara tm for systemic lupus erythematosus in when genelabs licensed exclusive rights to patents related to prestara from stanford university 
to potentially develop this investigational new drug we have incurred direct costs of approximately million through december  in we currently expect the costs to be lower than the levels by at least  as we have completed clinical work on the previous studies and have a significantly reduced staff 
we expect to incur continued costs for the development of a clinical trial protocol and possibly other matters 
future development decisions and the future development of prestara for lupus will depend on a number of factors  including discussions with and actions by the fda  discussions with and actions by our prestara collaborators and potential collaborators  and our financial resources 
we may decide to discontinue development of prestara in  which may further reduce the costs from planned levels  depending on the timing of the decision 

table of contents support costs and other research and development support costs and other research and development is primarily comprised of costs necessary to maintain a research and development facility  such as rent  insurance  depreciation  support staff  utilities  maintenance and the incentive bonus  which are allocated based on the headcount ratio between research and development and general and administrative 
support costs and other research and development included within research and development were million in compared to million in the following table breaks down the major components of support costs and other research and development in thousands facility rent  net of sublease income salaries and benefits for lab and facility support personnel insurance  depreciation and property taxes utilities  maintenance and security lab equipment  services and sundry supplies allocation of incentive bonus compensation other items total support and other research and development costs the decrease in expenses during as compared to was primarily due to a reduction of the incentive bonus costs due to cash balance contingencies our board of directors has established for the payment of any bonuses to employees 
as of december   the contingency had not been met and accordingly no incentive bonus charge was recorded 
the credit balance in the account for primarily represents the forfeiture of previous years accruals by participants that had been in genelabs long term incentive program 
other costs included in support costs and other research and development were generally comparable in and  although utilities increased modestly due to higher usage and higher energy costs  and salaries for support personnel decreased as genelabs consolidated operations that were no longer required 
in  we expect support costs and other research and development  other than employee incentive bonuses  to increase approximately in order to support planned higher direct drug discovery research activities 
in  we expect costs for the incentive bonus program to be dependent on our meeting board established contingency criteria and meeting our corporate objectives 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses decreased to million from million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  legal  business development  human resources and marketing departments  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and allocated facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
during  lower general and administrative costs were incurred for prestara marketing activities  business development  human resources and reduced allocation of costs that are shared between research and development and general and administrative expenses  such as the employee incentive bonus 
management currently expects our general and administrative expenses  excluding the allocation of shared costs  to increase by approximately compared to the general and administrative expenses if we maintain our same level of operations  primarily as a result of predicted inflationary increases in costs 
nonoperating income 
interest income was million in compared to million in  an increase of million primarily due to higher average interest rates 
in  we recorded million in a gain on sale of our discontinued operations and income from its operations 
because this transaction occurred during  there was no comparable income during years ended december  and introduction 
genelabs net loss was million in  a decrease of million from the million net loss in this decrease in net loss was primarily the result of higher contract revenue  lower research and 
table of contents development costs and a gain on the sale of a discontinued operation 
a more detailed discussion of the changes in genelabs statement of operations follows 
revenue 
revenues were million in and million in the following table breaks down revenue by major source in thousands contract revenue hcv drug discovery research collaboration gilead sciences  inc linker aided dna amplification license fees affymetrix  inc prestara collaborations watson pharmaceuticals  inc and tanabe seiyaku co  ltd 
hepatitis e vaccine milestone glaxosmithkline data analysis services total contract revenue royalties total revenue our research collaboration and license agreement with gilead sciences  inc provided million of revenue recognized in the agreement began in october  and under the agreement we recognized million for the pro rata share of an million up front license fee and million in research funding for the fourth quarter of because the agreement was signed during  there was no comparable revenue for in  we received a license amendment fee of million for our linker aided dna amplification technology 
this compares to license fees of  in the increase in compared to occurred because our licensee  affymetrix  inc  made a one time payment to us of million in exchange for receiving a fully paid up license without future royalty obligations 
we recognized the full amount we received as revenue because we have no significant future obligations to affymetrix under the agreement 
in  we recognized million in revenue from our two collaborations for development and commercialization of prestara with watson and tanabe 
in  our revenue related to prestara decreased by million compared to primarily due to a lengthening of the term we estimated it would take us to potentially obtain approval of prestara in the united states 
our lengthening of the estimated term to potentially receive approval in the united states was made based on negative clinical trial results received in  and our determination that approval would not be possible by the june time through which we were previously recognizing revenue 
the decrease in contract revenue recognized under the agreement with watson more than offset the incremental revenue recognized for the new agreement entered into during with tanabe seiyaku for japan 
in  glaxosmithkline  or gsk  paid us a million milestone based on the results of a clinical trial the walter reed army institute of research conducted in collaboration with gsk for a hepatitis e virus vaccine that gsk is developing under license from genelabs 
we recognized as revenue the full amount of the milestone we received because we have no further significant obligations to gsk 
revenue from data analysis services we have performed for other pharmaceutical companies declined to million in from million in because we chose to stop providing these services during the latter part of in addition  we receive various royalties from other parties  which aggregated approximately million in and million in the increase in royalties primarily represents an increase in royalties from affymetrix prior to their payment to us which eliminated future royalty obligations 

table of contents operating expenses 
the following table breaks down operating expenses into the two major categories of costs in our financial statements in thousands 
change research and development general and administrative total operating expenses all operating expenses are related to genelabs business of discovering and developing pharmaceutical products 
the two key decreases in operating expenses for compared to were lower costs from conducting our clinical trial of prestara for lupus and lower costs incurred for our employees incentive bonuses 
these are each explained in more detail below 
research and development expenses by project in  million of operating expenses were in research and development  compared to million in  a decrease of million for as compared to the following table breaks down the research and development expenses by major project in thousands change drug development prestara tm drug discovery hcv support costs and other research and development total research and development drug development prestara tm costs for prestara decreased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of a decreased average number of patients under treatment in our phase iii clinical trial  which completed enrollment in february this decrease was partially offset by higher costs incurred for a month open label follow on clinical trial for patients that elected to continue participation  although the per patient costs in the open label trial were lower than in the phase iii clinical trial 
genelabs also incurred lower costs related to the qualification of a manufacturing site for prestara 
drug discovery costs for our drug discovery program increased to million in from million in drug discovery costs were modestly higher in compared to largely due to higher personnel costs and additional research materials used during support costs and other research and development support costs and other research and development is primarily comprised of costs necessary to maintain a research and development facility  such as rent  support staff  maintenance and utilities  and the incentive bonus  all allocated based on the headcount ratio between research and development and general and administrative 
support costs and other research and development were million in and million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in costs during as compared to was primarily due to a reduction of the incentive bonus allocation in due to contingencies that were established for the payment of bonuses relating to the year  which were met in late and resulted in a higher charge for approximately two years of incentive bonus charges 
other costs included in support costs and other research and development were generally comparable in and 
table of contents general and administrative in both and  million of our operating expenses were general and administrative expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for executive management  finance  legal  business development  human resources and marketing departments  as well as professional expenses  such as legal and audit  and allocated facilities costs such as rent and insurance 
during  higher general and administrative costs were incurred for audit and legal fees  mostly related to new regulations covering public companies and higher patent costs due to our filing more patent applications arising from our hcv drug discovery program 
the increase in these audit and legal fees in offset decreases in the allocation of the incentive bonus to general and administrative expenses after contingencies were met during  increasing the costs for nonoperating income 
interest income was million in  an increase of million from due to higher average cash balances during and higher average interest rates 
in  we recorded million in a gain on sale of our discontinued operations and income from its operations compared to million in for income from its operations 
because the gain on sale was recorded during  the income from discontinued operations was higher in than in liquidity and capital resources we assess liquidity primarily by the cash and cash equivalents available to fund our operations 
genelabs had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million at december   which was a decrease of million from the cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was attributable to cash used in operations to fund our continued research on the discovery of new treatments for hepatitis c virus infection and development of prestara 
genelabs presently estimates that our current cash resources will be adequate to provide liquidity for our existing operations to approximately the beginning of the fourth quarter of we will require additional capital prior to this time to carry out our business plans in and expect to continue to rely on outside sources of financing to meet our capital needs 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional capital from a collaboration  equity financing or other means 
in order to satisfy its projected cash needs for at least the next twelve months  genelabs is pursuing various alternatives  including licensing its non nucleoside hcv polymerase program  renegotiating the terms of a collaboration and pursuing investments from third parties 
if any of these transactions are completed genelabs expects they would provide additional cash to the company  although the amounts are not determinable 
genelabs may be unable to complete any of these transactions as currently contemplated or at all  and the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time 
further  there can be no assurance  assuming the company successfully raises additional funds  that the company will ever achieve positive cash flow 
if the company is not able to secure additional funding the company will be required to scale back its research and development programs and general and administrative activities and may not be able to continue in business 
these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the specific amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  which might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in business 
the following are illustrations of potential impediments to our ability to successfully secure additional funds our stock price and market capitalization are low  therefore the amount of capital we can raise through equity financings is limited  our ability to successfully complete an equity financing would be negatively impacted if we fail to meet nasdaq s listing requirements  and our research programs are in an early stage  therefore there are fewer opportunities to enter into collaborations with other companies and up front payments for early stage pharmaceutical research collaborations are generally smaller than for projects that are closer to potential marketability 
longer term  if we succeed in securing sufficient capital to allow us to continue drug discovery research and complete an additional clinical trial for prestara  genelabs liquidity and capital resources may be materially 
table of contents impacted by success or failure in reaching milestones under corporate collaborations  the progress  if any  of the company s other  unpartnered drug discovery programs and fda actions with respect to our nda for prestara 
since genelabs inception  the company has operated at a loss and has funded operations primarily through public and private offerings of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  contract revenues 
we expect to incur substantial additional costs  including research costs for drug discovery 
the amount of additional costs in our business plans will depend on numerous factors including the progress of our research and development programs and the actions of corporate collaborators 
to meet our capital needs we will require additional funding  but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the unavailability of additional funds could delay or prevent the development  approval or marketing of some or all of our products and technologies  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other contractual arrangements 
genelabs principal research  clinical development and office facilities are leased from third parties under operating leases 
as such  genelabs expenses its facility rental costs over the terms of the respective leases as those costs are incurred 
other than the facility operating leases  genelabs does not have any financial off balance sheet arrangements 
all biotechnology companies in california that use radioactive materials must provide a means of assurance to the state that radioactive waste will be cleaned up in the event the facility is abandoned 
genelabs has provided this assurance by establishing a  standby letter of credit in favor of the radiologic health branch of the california department of health services 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit of  which is classified as restricted cash 
there are no contractual financial obligations that extend beyond the next five years 
our total contractual payment obligations for the next five years are as follows one to three to less than three five one year years years total in thousands operating leases item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s cash equivalents 
we consider the interest rate risk minimal as substantially all investments are in money market funds and we have not used derivative instruments 
as of december   the overall average maturity of genelabs short term investment portfolio was less than days  leaving only a minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
genelabs exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company s investment in a taiwan based biopharmaceutical company  genovate biotechnology co  ltd  which is accounted for at cost  based on the lower of cost or market value method 
this investment is the only item included in the balance sheet caption long term investments 
genelabs may attempt to divest a portion of this investment  in which case changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the proceeds received upon sale of these shares 
because the book value of genelabs ownership percentage of genovate is greater than our carrying cost  we currently do not believe that any foreign currency exchange rate changes would impact the value of this investment as reported in the financial statements unless the value of a taiwan dollar depreciates by greater than compared to the us dollar  which  depending on other circumstances  might require genelabs to record a non cash charge to write down the long term investment 
genelabs has not entered into any transactions to mitigate its exposure to changes in the exchange rate for its long term investment 
the genovate shares owned by genelabs currently are not transferable and we cannot predict when or if the shares will be transferable and at what price  if any
