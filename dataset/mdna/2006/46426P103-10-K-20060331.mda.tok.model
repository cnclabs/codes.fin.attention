item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a note concerning forward looking statements the discussion below contains certain forward looking statements that reflect our current expectations regarding the company s future results of operations  performance and achievements 
please see the discussion of such forward looking statements under forward looking statements in item above 
overview we have shifted from manufacturing in house to an outsourced manufacturing model wherein we supply raw materials to external parties and products are then completed 
further  this system allows us to outsource procurement in the future if we choose to do so 
manufacturing partners then produce to specification with company personnel on hand to assist with quality control 
our products are designed for efficient production in this manner  emphasizing solid state electronics over mechanical devices with moving parts 
the decrease in cost associated with these developments  coupled with enhanced product functionality  has allowed us to realize improved margins and significantly reduced overhead costs 
extensions of developed technology  based on substantial input from customers  have allowed us to launch the rf product family and consider additional solutions while generally controlling total r d cost 
wireless telecommunications has undergone significant merger activity in recent years  a trend which may continue 
these activities often result in operators with disparate technologies and spectrum assets  and the need to integrate those assets 
in addition  the deployment of data applications is adding to the industry requirement to integrate disparate technologies into base stations and other fixed points of access  resulting in need to manage multiple wireless signals and keep them from interfering with each other 
we are focused on providing solutions that address these types of requirements 
during  we bid on substantially larger business opportunities than we had in recent years 
these proposals often are accompanied by long approval cycles and up front product development costs 
we believe the potential benefits to outweigh these costs  and expect to continue to bid on these types of business opportunities 
we announced several significant recent events  both during and early  such as the resolution of the patent litigation  substantially increased revenue during including the four best quarterly revenue figures in our history  increased international sales and sourcing activities  the expansion of our customer base  the extension of our credit line debt maturity date from april to august  and million in funding intended to support new product development 
despite these improvements  the wireless telecommunications industry is subject to risks beyond our control that can negatively impact customer capital spending budgets as occurred during and or spending patterns as occurred during 
for these and other reasons  our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
as an after market vendor  our revenue has been sporadic  consistent with buying patterns of planning processes within wireless telecommunications carriers 
in the past there has been a fourth quarter effect  wherein operators were forced to spend remaining budget or lose it going forward 
with the advent of significant projects such as the deployment of data networks  funds are often reallocated between periods and thus diminish the pool of funds available for normal activities 
our objective is to be included in these projects  and thus realize a higher  more stable revenue stream 
we are also pursuing digital technologies  including the deployment of our digital anf solution for pcs during the beginning of we believe that producing solutions in digital format will allow us to extend coverage in the wireless telecommunications realm  both in more aspects of the cellular market and beyond the cellular market  and thus greatly increase our available market 
results of operations years ended december  and our net sales increased  or  from  in to  in this increase was due primarily to the expansion of the rf product family and related revenues  particularly from data network deployments 
an incremental improvement was also seen from the shipment of more anf products during  such that the company earned more revenue from anf sales than any prior year  including we anticipate our unit volume and related revenue to increase during as compared to  due to existing and or anticipated customer orders 
our order backlog as of december  remained minimal  which was consistent with the previous two quarters 
however  we are pursuing substantial potential revenue opportunities as of the beginning of cost of products sold increased  or  from  in to  in the increase in cost of sales was due to the increase in sales volume offset by the more efficient allocation of fixed expenses  the expanded sourcing of raw materials and resulting cost decreases  and other efficiencies 
our internally funded research and development expenses increased  or  from  in to  during we expensed approximately  of capitalized patent related charges during the second quarter  as it deemed such items to be unlikely to generate significant future revenues 
we added a significant number of products to our rf product family during  including a multicoupler solution and a pcs spectrum portfolio 
we expect to continue to invest more in r d during than we did during as we expand both our existing product families and develop two new product lines that would be applicable in wireless technologies beyond cellular telecommunications 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or  from  during to  during we have continued to add personnel in this area as we pursue larger business opportunities and additional customers  and thus expect to continue to incur a higher level of selling and marketing expenses in future periods 
it should be noted that this cost as a percentage of revenue has decreased from during to during  reflecting efficiencies in higher sales volume as fixed expenses are allocated over a larger base 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in to  during this decrease was attributable to a million decrease in legal expenses  primarily related to the concluded patent litigation  the reduction in facility costs by approximately  annually  which is offset by various increases in personnel and related costs due to growth in our size 

table of contents interest income increased  or  from  in to  during this increase was due to the timing of payments and funding from the credit line and the august financing proceeds 
interest and warrant expense decreased  or  from  in to  during we borrowed million under our credit line arrangement during  but pursuant to a financing agreement with our lenders  the interest rate was reduced from to as of april years ended december  and our net sales decreased  or  from  in to  in  as a result of an industry wide reduction in capital expenditures  particularly during the first half of  in favor of next generation systems generally to be deployed during and beyond 
consistent with this event  we announced more than million in orders received during that were delivered during the first quarter of cost of products sold decreased  or from  in to  in this decrease is less than the decrease in revenue during the period  reflecting inefficiencies realized due to lower unit volumes 
the cost of products sold for and consisted of direct material  labor and overhead costs associated with the products that were shipped during the period  as well as other costs consisting primarily of allocated overhead costs 
our internally funded research and development expenses increased  or  from  in to  during this increase was due to the need to deploy resources in order to launch new products  particularly within the rf product family  and broadly to support new product and next generation development for future release 
selling and marketing expenses increased  or  from  during to  during this increase was due to the funding of additional resources in this area  as well as the expansion of marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from  in to  during this decrease was due to the reduction in expenses in the now concluded patent litigation  as well as the classification of  in legal settlement expenses during interest income increased  or  from  in to  during this increase was due to the timing of payments and funding from the credit line 
interest and warrant expense decreased  or  from  in to  during we borrowed million during the fourth quarter of under our uncommitted line of credit with entities affiliated with its two largest shareholders 
we borrowed additional monies under this line and related supplements during and as a result of the borrowings on this line during  million warrants were issued 
these warrants were ultimately converted into million shares of our common stock during february the interest expense recorded during includes  of non cash expense related to these warrants 
we have reclassified into general and administrative costs a previously reported other expense item of  that was accrued as of december  as a contingent liability for the laves litigation settlement 
this settlement was negotiated and entered into during february other comparative results during  we recorded million of other expense 
this amount was comprised of a litigation settlement in the siegler case of million as well as approximately million from certain restructuring costs from the consolidation of facilities 
liquidity and capital resources the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  we incurred a net loss of million during the year ended december   and  as of that date  our accumulated deficit is million 
in addition  we have consistently used  rather than provided  cash in our operations 
these factors  among others  as discussed in note to the financial statements  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have been engaged in developing new solutions  and toward that end development spending has preceded sales revenues 
management s plans in regard to these matters include the focusing of development efforts on products with a greater probability of commercial sales  increased efficiencies and reduced product costs within our outsourced production model  all of which are also described in note the financial statements do not include any adjustments  including any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
significant uses of cash during included personnel costs  the cost to produce inventory  facility related costs  increased product development engineering costs and sales and marketing efforts 
significant sources of cash during include sales and the resulting realization of customer receivables  the draw of million on our credit line  and the sale of million in common stock in august to entities that  along with their affiliates  are our lenders and also our largest two shareholders 
pursuant to the provisions of section of the exchange act  these entities also remitted approximately million in profits from sales of our common stock during the six months preceding this financing to us 
current assets including accounts receivable and inventory  and current liabilities including accounts payable and accrued expenses  increased from the prior year figure due to overall higher business levels 
quarterly revenue during was the highest in our history and roughly four times that of the prior year  and thus created larger working capital balances 
working capital includes the classifications listed above 

table of contents in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraph  recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations  which in turn is dependent upon our ability to meet our financing requirements on a continuing basis  to maintain present financing  and to succeed in our future operations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents  excluding restricted certificates of deposit  were  an increase of  from the december  balance of  this increase was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the august financing 
the continuing development of  and expansion in  sales of our rf product lines  as well as any required defense of our intellectual property  may require a commitment of funds to undertake product line development and to market and sell our rf products 
the actual amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount and timing of future revenues  the level of product marketing and sales efforts to support our commercialization plans  the magnitude of our research and product development programs  our ability to improve or maintain product margins  and the costs involved in protecting our patents or other intellectual property 
we believe that we have sufficient funds to operate our business through as it was managed during however  projected increases in working capital requirements from several significant business opportunities during and beyond  and also the expected deployment of additional financial resources in the expansion of our business and product offering that are expected to provide additional business opportunities  may require additional capital during the second half of we intend to look into augmenting our existing capital position by continuing to evaluate potential short term and long term sources of capital whether from debt  equity  hybrid  or other methods 
the primary covenant in our existing uncommitted line of credit involves the right of the lenders to receive debt repayment from the proceeds of new financing activities 
this covenant may restrict our ability to apply the proceeds of a financing event toward operations until the debt is repaid in full 
uncommitted line of credit as of the reporting date  we have drawn million of debt financing under a credit line  as described below 
during october  we entered into an uncommitted line of credit with our two largest shareholders  an affiliate of elliott associates  lp manchester securities corporation and alexander finance  lp this line initially provided up to million to us 
this line was uncommitted  such that each new borrowing under the facility would be subject to the approval of the lenders 
borrowings on this line initially bore an interest rate of and were collateralized by all of our assets 
outstanding loans under this agreement would be required to be repaid on a priority basis should we receive new funding from other sources 
additionally  the lenders were entitled to receive warrants to the extent funds were drawn down on the line 
the warrants bore a strike price of per share of common stock and were to expire on april  the credit line was to mature and be due  including accrued interest thereon  on march  due to a subsequent agreement between the parties no warrants were issued with subsequent borrowings 
according to existing accounting pronouncements and sec guidelines  we allocated the proceeds of these borrowings between their debt and equity components 
as a result of these borrowings during  we recorded a non cash charge of million through the outstanding term of the warrants april  
 and  of that amount were recorded during and  respectively 
these warrants were valued at million of the million debt instrument based on a black scholes valuation that included the difference between the value of our common stock and the exercise price of the warrants on the date of each warrant issuance and a discounted face value of the notes  leaving the remaining million as the underlying value of the debt 
this million was amortized over the vesting period of the warrants six quarters from the fourth quarter through the first quarter 
during october  we entered into an agreement with our lenders to supplement the credit line with an additional million  million of which was drawn immediately and million subsequently drawn upon our request and subject to the approval of the lenders 
this supplemental facility bore a rate of interest and was due october  the term of the previous credit line was not affected by this supplement  and as such the million borrowed under that line  plus accrued interest  remained due march  during february  these credit lines were extended to a due date of april  with interest after the initial periods to be charged at 
no warrants or other inducements were issued with respect to these extensions 
additionally  lenders exercised their million warrants during february  agreeing to let us use the funds for general purposes as opposed to repaying debt 
during july  our leading lenders agreed to increase the aggregate loan commitments under the credit line from  to  simultaneously  we drew the remaining  of the financing 
during november  our lenders agreed to increase the line of credit to up to an additional million to an aggregate loan commitment of  million of which was drawn immediately by us with the remaining million drawable upon our request and subject to the approval of the lenders  which occurred during january during february  the consolidated credit line was extended until april  interest during the extension period was to be charged at 
no warrants or other inducements were issued with respect to this extension 
on august   we and our lenders agreed to extend the due date from april until august  and the lenders also agreed to waive our obligation to repay its debt with proceeds of the august financing 
no warrants or other inducements were issued as a result of this transaction  which was a part of the financing described previously 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are generally recognized at the time of shipment and are recorded net of estimated returns and allowances 
revenues from services are generally recognized upon substantial completion of the service and acceptance by the customer 
we have under certain conditions  granted customers the right to return product during a specified period of time after shipment 
in these situations  we establish a liability for estimated returns and allowances at the time of shipment and make the appropriate adjustment in revenue recognized for accounting purposes 
during  no revenue was recognized on products that included a right to return or otherwise required customer acceptance after december  we have established a program which  in certain situations  allows customers or prospective customers to field test our products for a specified period of time 
revenues from field test arrangements are recognized upon customer acceptance of the products 
we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship typically for a year period from the date of shipment  though these terms may be negotiated on a case by case basis 
a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty expenses is recorded when revenues are recognized 
at december  and  respectively  we accrued  and  for warranty costs 
this warranty reserve is based on the cost to replace a percentage of products in the field at a given point  adjusted by actual experience 
returns and allowances were not significant in any period reported  and form a data point in establishing the reserve 
should this warranty reserve estimate be deemed insufficient  by new information  experience  or otherwise  an increase to warranty expense would be required 
goodwill and intangible assets as of september   we completed our annual process of evaluating goodwill for impairment under sfas no 
as the fair value of the enterprise  using quoted market prices for our common stock  exceeded the carrying amount  goodwill was determined to be not impaired 
we assess the potential for impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill is less than its fair value  a write down may be required 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows expected to be generated 
if intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value 
allowance for doubtful receivables an allowance for doubtful receivables may be maintained for potential credit losses 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  on a client by client basis  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful receivables including customer credit worthiness and current economic trends and records any necessary bad debt expense based on the best estimate of the facts known to date 
alternatives to this approach include applying a fixed and or empirical rate of bad debts to receivables 
as bad debts have historically been very low none in or  such an empirical approach would have little impact on the reserve at december  further  we believe our current method to be less arbitrary and more reliable than the alternatives as described 
should the facts regarding the collectability of receivables change  the resulting change in the allowance would be charged or credited to income in the period such determination is made 
such a change could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
compensation costs for employee stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
please refer to recent accounting pronouncements for the discussion of the new fas r standard that will apply to us as of january  
table of contents contractual obligations  commitments  and off balance sheet arrangements no such arrangements existed as of december   except for leases as described and the minimum lease payments as detailed in this document 
contractual obligations payments due by period year total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflect on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
the statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  as of january  for us and are to be applied prospectively 
we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in an accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless such retrospective application would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes apb no 
 which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be the requirement that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  and will have an effect on us to the extent we make an accounting change or corrects an error 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
compensation cost is to be measured based on the estimated fair value of the equity based compensation awards issued as of the grant date 
the related compensation expense will be based on the estimated number of awards expected to vest and will be recognized over the requisite service period often the vesting period for each grant 
the statement requires the use of assumptions and judgments about future events and some of the inputs to the valuation models will require considerable judgment by management 
sfas no 
r replaces fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the provisions of sfas no 
r are required to be applied by public companies that do not file as small business issuers  as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   and all other public companies as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  on april   the sec adopted a new rule amending the effective date for statement r 
the amended rule allows registrants to implement statement r as of the first annual period beginning after june   which is january  for us 
we applied apb opinion no 
to equity based compensation awards until the effective date of sfas no 
r 
at the effective date of sfas no 
r  we used the modified prospective application transition method without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption 
this will result in us recognizing compensation cost based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all equity based compensation awards issued after the effective date of this statement with respect to us 
for all equity based compensation awards that are unvested as of that date  compensation cost will be recognized for the unamortized portion of compensation cost not previously included in the sfas no 
pro forma footnote disclosure 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
r will materially impact our results of operations or financial position with respect to outstanding options  and expect that the adoption may or may not have a material effect on our results of operations depending on the level and form of future equity based compensation awards issued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have any material market risk sensitive instruments
