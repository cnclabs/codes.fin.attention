item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
part i item business general royal gold  inc royal gold  the company  we  us  or our  together with its subsidiaries  is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals royalties 
royalties are passive non operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue from the project after deducting specified costs  if any 
we seek to acquire existing royalties or to finance projects that are in production or near production in exchange for royalty interests 
we also fund exploration on properties thought to contain precious metals and seek to obtain royalties and other carried ownership interests in such properties through the subsequent transfer of operating interests to other mining companies 
substantially all of our revenues are and will be expected to be derived from royalty interests 
we do not conduct mining operations at this time 
as discussed in further detail below  some of our significant developments during fiscal year were as follows our royalty revenues increased to million  compared with million during fiscal year  we completed the purchase of four royalty interests on the taparko bouroum project taparko project  located in burkina faso  west africa  and operated by high river gold mines ltd high river  we completed the purchase of two existing royalties held by kennecott minerals kennecott  which included a net smelter return nsr royalty on the robinson mine and a sliding scale nsr royalty on the mulatos mine  we entered into two exploration and earn in agreements with taranis resources inc taranis with respect to its exploration program in finland  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  and we declared an increase in our annual dividend to per basic share  which is paid in quarterly installments throughout calendar this represents a increase compared with the dividend paid during calendar year we were incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january  our executive offices are located at wynkoop street  suite  denver  colorado  
table of contents royalty interests and acquisitions royalty interests during the fiscal year  we focused on the management of our existing royalty interests  the acquisition of royalty interests  and the creation of royalty interests through financing and strategic exploration alliances

currently  our royalty rate would increase to at a gold price of approximately per ounce in today s dollars 
our royalty covers a portion of the bald mountain mine  which is located in white pine county  nevada  and is operated by barrick 
during our fiscal year  we acquired the following royalty interests see royalty acquisitions below for further discussion of these royalty acquisitions taparko four royalty interests on the taparko project  located in burkina faso and operated by high river 
our four royalty interests at the taparko project are o tb gsr a production payment equivalent to a gsr royalty on all gold produced from the taparko project until either cumulative production of  ounces of gold is achieved or until we receive million in cumulative payments  o tb gsr a production payment equivalent to a gsr sliding scale royalty on all gold produced from the taparko project

royalty acquisitions high river gold tarparko project financing on march   we entered into an amended and restated funding agreement funding agreement with societe des mines de taparko  also known as somita sa somita  a owned subsidiary of high river  to acquire two initial production payments equivalent to gsr royalties and two subsequent gsr royalty interests on the taparko project in burkina faso  west africa 
the funding agreement amended and restated the initial funding agreement dated december   among royal gold  high river and somita 
the taparko project is operated by somita 
our funding of the project will total million over approximately a one year period  which will be used for the development and construction of the taparko project 
construction of the taparko project has been initiated by somita and is expected to be near completion during the fourth quarter of calendar  with production expected to commence during the first quarter of calendar as of june   we have funded approximately million of the million total funding commitment 
as a result of our funding to date  we have obtained the following mineral interests  all related to the taparko project tb gsr a production payment equivalent to a fifteen percent gsr royalty on all gold produced from the taparko project 
tb gsr remains in force until cumulative production of  ounces of gold is achieved or until cumulative payments of million have been made to us  whichever is earlier 
tb gsr a production payment equivalent to a gsr sliding scale royalty on all gold produced from the taparko project 
tb gsr will be paid concurrently with tb gsr  and remains in force until the termination of tb gsr the sliding scale royalty rate will be determined as follows a 
when the average price of gold is per ounce or more  the rate will be equal to the average price divided by eg  a gold price divided by 

table of contents b 
when the average gold price is per ounce or less  the rate will be equal to the average price divided by eg  a gold price divided by 
c 
when the average price is between and per ounce  the rate is 
tb gsr a perpetual gsr royalty on all gold produced from the taparko project area 
payments under tb gsr will commence upon termination of the tb gsr and tb gsr royalties 
tb mr a milling fee royalty  calculated in the same manner as the tb gsr royalty  on all gold processed through the taparko project processing facilities that is mined from any area outside of the taparko project area 
tb mr royalty is subject to a cap of million tons per year eg  if in a given year  the taparko project processing facility processes  tons of ore from the taparko project area and  tons of ore from areas outside the taparko project area  the  tons from the taparko project area would be subject to tb gsr  tb gsr  or tb gsr and the tb mri would only apply to  tons of ore 
during july and august of  we funded an additional to the taparko project  resulting in total funding by us of as of august  subsequent funding of the taparko project will be made in installments over the remaining construction period 
the funding agreement outlines the construction milestones that must be met prior to each specific funding installment 
the project is expected to meet all construction requirements as defined in the funding agreement no later than second quarter of calendar we estimate the million will be fully funded by the second quarter of calendar  subject to construction milestones 
under a separate contribution agreement  high river is responsible for contributing additional equity contributions for any cost overruns incurred during the construction and construction warranty periods 
if high river is unable to make the required equity contributions  we have the right to either a provide funding that high river failed to fund  or b declare a default under the funding agreement 
in the event that we elect to provide funding in the amount that high river fails to fund  we may elect to acquire either an equity interest in high river  consisting of units of common shares and warrants of high river or to obtain additional royalty interests in the taparko project in an amount that is proportional to the amount of the additional funding compared with our original million funding commitment 
as of august   high river has made all required equity commitments as scheduled under its contribution agreement 
in order to secure our investment during the period between funding by us and project completion as defined in the funding agreement  high river has pledged its interest in the equity of somita 
we will maintain our security interest  in the form of the somita shares  through the construction period 
the security interest will be released upon the project meeting project completion as defined in the funding agreement 
in addition to the interest in somita  we have also obtained as collateral a pledge of shares of two equity investments held by high river 
the equity value underlying the pledge of these shares is valued at approximately million as of june   and includes  common shares in the capital stock of pelangio mines  inc traded on the toronto stock exchange and valued at approximately million as of june  and  common shares in the capital stock of intrepid minerals corporation traded on the toronto stock exchange and valued at approximately million as of june  
the purpose of this collateral is to maintain a construction reserve that can be used to 
table of contents remedy any construction defects noted during the construction contract warranty period 
these shares can only be used to remedy identified construction defects and cannot be used to repay any of our investment 
this security interest will be released by the company at the end of the construction contract warranty period 
robinson and mulatos royalties on december   we paid million to kennecott in exchange for two existing royalty interests held by kennecott  including a nsr royalty on the robinson mine  located in eastern nevada  and a sliding scale nsr royalty on the mulatos mine  located in sonora  mexico 
the robinson mine is an open pit copper mine with significant gold and molybdenum credits 
the mine has been owned and operated by quadra since quadra estimates that calendar year production will be approximately  ounces of gold and to million pounds of copper 
quadra completed construction of a molybdenum circuit during the first quarter of during august  quadra reported that their original molybdenum production estimates to million pounds will not be met 
quadra was not able to provide updated molybdenum estimates at this time 
we began receiving royalty payments from the robinson royalty during the fourth quarter of fiscal after a million reclamation trust account was fully funded by quadra 
the mulatos project  owned and operated by alamos  is an open pit  heap leach gold mine 
commercial production was achieved at the mulatos mine effective april   at which time royalty payments began to accrue to royal gold 
alamos anticipates that once full production is reached  yearly production is expected to average  ounces of gold 
the mulatos mine sliding scale royalty  capped at two million ounces of gold production  ranges from for gold prices below up to for gold prices above taranis exploration alliance on november   we entered into two exploration and earn in agreements the agreements with taranis with respect to its exploration program in finland 
as part of the first agreement  we will obtain a nsr royalty and future earn in rights on any new property acquired by taranis in finland as a result of its regional exploration program  in exchange for a  investment in  shares of taranis common stock and  warrants 
on august   we acquired  under a private placement  an additional  shares of taranis common stock and warrants exercisable to purchase up to  taranis common shares at 
as part of the agreements  we agreed to provide funding totaling  to taranis for exploration work on the kettukuusikko property in lapland  finland  in exchange for a nsr royalty on the property 
as of june   we have funded the entire  commitment 
we also have an option to fund up to an additional  for exploration at the kettukuusikko property 
if we fund the entire additional amount  we will earn a joint venture interest in the kettukuusikko project  and we will release our nsr royalty 
we have elected to exercise this option 
in the event that we do not fully fund the  to earn the joint venture interest  we would retain our nsr royalty 

table of contents our operational information financial results our financial results are closely tied to the price of gold and production from our royalty properties 
during the fiscal year  the price of gold averaged per ounce compared with an average price of per ounce for the fiscal year 
as a result of the increased gold price  our gsr sliding scale royalty rate at the pipeline mining complex paid out at rates ranging from to compared rates ranging from to during the prior period 
lower production at the pipeline mining complex which was largely offset by rising metal prices and an increase in our gsr sliding scale royalty  an increase in revenues from sj claims and bald mountain  and payments from the recently acquired mulatos and robinson royalties resulted in revenues of  during the fiscal year  compared with total revenues of  during the fiscal year 
during our fiscal  we derived most of our revenue from royalties from the pipeline mining complex 
in fiscal  we generated royalty revenues of  from the pipeline mining complex  representing of our total revenues 
in addition  we generated royalty revenue of  from the sj claims   from the troy mine   from the leeville mine   from bald mountain   from robinson   from mulatos  and  from the martha mine 
sales contracts in fiscal  we received our royalties in cash except for the nvr royalty from the pipeline mining complex  which we currently receive in gold 
we sold  ounces of gold bullion in fiscal year  utilizing one metal trading company during the period  at an average realized price of per ounce 
we sold  ounces of gold bullion in fiscal year  utilizing one metal trading company during the period  at an average realized price of per ounce 
we maintain trading relationships with a number of metal trading companies 
we held no gold in inventory as of june  company personnel on august   we had full time employees and one part time employee located in denver  colorado 
our employees are not subject to a labor contract or collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
consulting services  relating primarily to geologic and geophysical interpretations and also relating to such metallurgical  engineering  and other technical matters as may be deemed useful in the operation of our business  are primarily provided by independent contractors 
regulation like all mining operations in the united states  the operators of the mines that are subject to our royalties must comply with environmental laws and regulations promulgated by federal  state and local governments including  but not limited to  the national environmental policy act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the 
table of contents hazardous materials transportation act  and the toxic substances control act 
mines located on public lands are subject to comprehensive regulation by either the united states bureau of land management an agency of the united states department of the interior or the united states forest service an agency of the united states department of agriculture 
the mines also are subject to regulations of the united states environmental protection agency epa  the united states mine safety and health administration and similar state and local agencies 
operators of mines that are subject to our royalties in other countries are obligated to comply with similar laws and regulations in those jurisdictions 
although we are not responsible as a royalty owner for ensuring compliance with these regulations  failure by the operators of the mines on which we have royalties to comply with applicable laws  regulations and permits can result in injunctive action  damages and civil and criminal penalties on the operators which could reduce production from the mines and thereby reduce the royalties we receive and negatively affect our financial condition 
proposed legislation affecting the mining industry over the last fifteen years  the united states congress considered a number of proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  the general mining law  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
in  a holding fee of us per claim was imposed upon unpatented mining claims located on federal lands 
beginning in october  a moratorium  on processing of new patent applications was approved 
in addition  a variety of legislation has been proposed from time to time  which would  among other things  change the current patenting procedures  limit the rights obtained in a patent  impose royalties on unpatented claims  and enact new reclamation  environmental controls and restoration requirements 
the royalty proposal ranges from a two percent royalty on net profits from mining claims to an eight percent royalty on modified gross income net smelter returns 
the extent of any such changes that may be enacted is not presently known  and the potential impact on us as a result of future congressional action is difficult to predict 
the majority of our royalties are on public lands 
if enacted  the proposed legislation could adversely affect the economics of development of operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
the gsr and gsr royalties relating to the pipeline mining complex  operated by the cortez joint venture  authorize the deduction of costs of mining law reform from the revenues to which those royalties apply 
the costs of mining law reform is defined as any royalty assessment  production tax or other levy imposed on and measured by production  to the extent that any such charge is imposed in the future by the united states in connection with the reform of the general mining law 
the gsr royalty relating to the pipeline mining complex authorizes the deduction of any royalty payable in the future to the united states with respect to that production 
our financial performance could therefore be materially and adversely affected by passage of all or pertinent parts of the proposed legislation

table of contents item a 
risk factors every investor or potential investor in royal gold should carefully consider the following risks risks related to our business our revenues are largely dependent on a single property 
in fiscal year  approximately of our revenues were derived from royalties from the pipeline mining complex  compared to approximately being derived from the pipeline mining complex in fiscal year we expect that revenue from our royalties on the pipeline mining complex will continue to be a significant  though less dominant  contributor to our revenue in future periods 
our success has been  and to a lesser degree will continue to be  dependent on the extent to which the pipeline mining complex continues to be a substantial mining operation 
we own passive interests in mining properties  and it is difficult or impossible for us to ensure properties are operated in our best interest 
all of our current revenue is derived from royalties on properties operated by third parties 
the holder of a royalty interest typically has no executive authority regarding development or operation of a mineral property 
therefore  we are not in control of basic decisions regarding development or operation of any of the properties in which we hold a royalty interest  and we have limited or no legal rights to influence those decisions 
our strategy of having others operate properties in which we retain a royalty or other passive interest puts us generally at risk to the decisions of others regarding all basic operating matters  including permitting  feasibility analysis  mine design and operation  processing  plant and equipment matters  and temporary or permanent suspension of operations  among others 
these decisions may be motivated by the best interests of the operator rather than to maximize royalties 
although we attempt to secure contractual rights that will permit us to protect our interests  there can be no assurance that such rights will always be available or sufficient  or that our efforts will be successful in achieving timely or favorable results or in affecting the operations of the properties in which we have royalty interests in ways that would be beneficial to our stockholders 
decreases in prices of gold  silver and copper would reduce our royalty revenues 
the profitability of our royalty interests and exploration properties is directly related to the market price of gold and  to a lesser degree  silver and copper 
the market price of each metal fluctuates widely and is affected by numerous factors beyond the control of any mining company 
these factors include industrial and jewelry fabrication demand  expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  the relative strength of the u 
s dollar and other currencies  interest rates  gold sales and loans by central banks  forward sales by metal producers  global or regional political  economic or banking crises  and a number of other factors 
if the market price of gold  silver or copper should drop  our royalty revenues would also drop 
our sliding scale gsr royalty amplifies this 
when the gold price falls below the steps in the sliding scale gsr royalty  we receive a lower royalty rate on production 
in addition  if the gold  silver or copper price drops dramatically  we might not be able to recover our investment in royalty interests or properties 
the selection of a royalty investment or of a property for exploration or development  the determination 
table of contents to construct a mine and place it into production  and the dedication of funds necessary to achieve such purposes are decisions that must be made long before the first revenues from production will be received 
price fluctuations between the time that such decisions are made and the commencement of production can have a material adverse effect on the economics of a mine  and can eliminate or have a material adverse impact on the value of royalty interests 
the volatility in gold prices is illustrated by the following table  which sets forth  for the periods indicated calendar year  the high and low prices in us dollars per ounce of gold  based on the london us fix 
gold price per ounce year high low january august  the volatility in silver prices is illustrated by the following table which sets forth  for the periods indicated calendar year  the high and low prices in us dollars per ounce of silver  based on the london us fix 
silver price per ounce year high low january august  
table of contents the volatility in copper prices is illustrated by the following table  which sets forth  for the periods indicated calendar year  the high and low prices in us dollars per pound of copper  based on the london metal exchange cash settlement price for copper grade a 
copper price per pound year high low january july  we depend on the services of our president and chief executive officer  our executive chairman and other key employees 
we believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key executive management personnel 
currently  tony jensen is serving as president and chief executive officer and stanley dempsey is serving as our executive chairman 
mr 
jensen has extensive experience in mining operations 
mr 
dempsey s knowledge of the legal and commercial aspects of royalties and his extensive contacts within the mining industry give us an important competitive advantage 
loss of the services of mr 
jensen  mr 
dempsey or other key employees could jeopardize our ability to maintain our competitive position in the industry 
we currently do not have key person life insurance for any of our officers or directors 
our revenues are subject to operational risks of the mining industry 
although we are not required to pay operating costs  our financial results are subject to all of the hazards and risks normally associated with developing and operating mining properties  both for the properties where we are exploring or indirectly for properties operated by others where we hold royalty interests 
these risks include insufficient ore reserves  fluctuations in production costs that may make mining of ore uneconomic  declines in the price of gold  silver or copper  significant environmental and other regulatory restrictions  labor disputes  
table of contents geological problems  pit walls or tailings dam failures  natural catastrophes such as floods or earthquakes  and the risk of injury to persons  property or the environment 
operating cost increases can have a negative effect on the value of and income from our royalty interests  and may cause an operator to curtail  delay or close operations at a mine site 
estimates of reserves and mineralization by the operators of mines in which we have royalty interests are subject to significant estimates which can change 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable reserves and mineralization  including many factors beyond our control or that of the operators of mineral properties in which we have a royalty interest 
reserve estimates on our royalty interests are prepared by the operators of the mining properties  and we do not participate in the preparation of such reports 
the estimation of reserves and of other mineralization is a subjective process and the accuracy of any such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  metallurgical testing and production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate may cause revision of such estimates 
the volume and grade of reserves recovered and rates of production may be less than anticipated 
assumptions about prices are subject to great uncertainty and such prices have fluctuated widely in the past 
declines in the market price of gold or other precious metals also may render reserves or mineralization containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit 
changes in operating and capital costs and other factors including short term operating factors  such as the need for sequential development of ore bodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may materially and adversely affect reserves 
we may be unable to acquire additional royalty interests 
our future success depends upon our ability to acquire royalty interests to replace depleting reserves and to diversify our royalty portfolio 
we anticipate that most of our revenues will be derived from royalty interests that we acquire or finance  rather than through exploration and development of properties 
in addition  we face competition in the acquisition of royalty interests 
if we are unable to successfully acquire additional royalties  the reserves on properties currently covered by our royalties will decline as existing reserves are mined 
anticipated federal legislation could decrease our royalty revenues 
in recent years  the united states congress has considered a number of proposed major revisions of the general mining law  which governs the creation and possession of mining claims and related activities on federal public lands in the united states 
it is possible that another bill may be introduced in the congress and it is possible that a new law could be enacted 
if and when a new mining law is enacted  it might impose a royalty upon production of minerals from federal lands and might contain new requirements for mined land reclamation  and similar environmental control and reclamation measures 
it remains unclear to what extent new legislation may affect existing mining claims or operations  but it could raise the cost of mining operations  perhaps materially affecting operators and our royalty revenue 

table of contents the effect of any revision of the general mining law on royalty interests in the united states cannot be determined conclusively until such revision  if any  is enacted 
the majority of our interests are on public lands 
if a royalty  assessment  production tax or other levy imposed on and measured by production is charged to the operator at the pipeline mining complex  the amount of that charge would be deducted from gross proceeds for calculation of our gsr  gsr and gsr royalties 
the mining industry is subject to significant environmental risks 
mining is subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration and production 
laws and regulations in the united states and abroad intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and generally are becoming more restrictive and costly 
insurance against environmental risks including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of the disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production is not generally available to the companies within the mining industry  such as the operators of the mines in which we hold a royalty interest  at a reasonable price 
if an operator is forced to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations or becomes subject to environmental restrictions that limit its ability to continue or expand operations  it could reduce our royalty revenues 
to the extent that we become subject to environmental liabilities for the time period during which we were operating properties  the satisfaction of any liabilities would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  we settled a claim by the epa against royal gold  along with other potentially responsible parties  known as prps 
the epa s allegation was based on the disposal of allegedly hazardous petroleum exploration wastes at the casmalia resources hazardous waste site by our predecessor  royal resources  inc  during and although we do not currently expect to incur additional costs in connection with this claim  the state of california has notified us and the other parties who participated in the settlement that it will seek to recover response costs 
we do not know and cannot predict the amount of the estimated costs the state would seek to recover but  if we are compelled to pay a large sum  it could materially adversely affect our operations 
if the state agrees to a volumetric allocation among the parties  our portion of the liability would be of any settlement amount 
please see part i  item legal proceedings casmalia resources hazardous waste disposal site  of this annual report on form k 
if title to properties are not properly maintained by the operators  our royalty revenues may be decreased 
the validity of unpatented mining claims  which constitute a significant portion of the properties on which we hold royalties in the united states  is often uncertain and such validity is always subject to contest 
unpatented mining claims are generally considered subject to greater title risk than patented mining claims  or real property interests that are owned in fee simple 
foreign operations are subject to many risks 
our foreign activities are subject to the risks normally associated with conducting business in foreign countries 
this includes exchange controls and currency fluctuations  limitations on repatriation of earnings  foreign taxation  foreign environmental laws and enforcement  expropriation or nationalization of property  labor practices and disputes  and uncertain political and economic environments 
there are also risks of war and civil disturbances  as well as other risks that could cause exploration or development 
table of contents difficulties or stoppages  restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation or loss of contract rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation  without fair compensation 
exploration licenses granted by some foreign countries do not include the right to mine 
each country has discretion in determining whether to grant a license to mine 
if an operator cannot secure a mining license following exploration of a property  the value of our royalty interest would be negatively affected 
foreign operations could also be adversely impacted by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade  investment and taxation 
we currently have interests in projects in argentina  burkina faso  finland  mexico and russia 
we also pursue precious metal royalty acquisitions or development opportunities in other parts of the world  including canada  central america  europe  australia  other republics of the former soviet union  asia  africa and south america 
we are also subject to the risks of operating in burkina faso  west africa 
countries in the region have historically experienced periods of political uncertainty  exchange rate fluctuations  balance of payments and trade difficulties as well as problems associated with extreme poverty and unemployment 
any of these economic or political risks could adversely affect the taparko project 
our operations in mexico are subject to risks such as the effects of political developments and local unrest  and communal property issues
