item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview nstar or the company is a holding company engaged through its subsidiaries in the energy delivery business serving approximately million customers in massachusetts  including approximately million electric distribution customers in communities and approximately  natural gas distribution customers in communities 
nstar s retail utility subsidiaries are boston edison company boston edison  commonwealth electric company comelectric  cambridge electric light company cambridge electric and nstar gas company nstar gas 
its wholesale electric subsidiary is canal electric company canal 
nstar s three retail electric companies collectively operate as nstar electric 
reference in this report to nstar shall mean the registrant nstar or nstar and its subsidiaries as the context requires 
reference in this report to nstar electric shall mean boston edison  comelectric and cambridge electric together 
nstar s non utility  unregulated operations include district energy operations through its advanced energy systems  inc subsidiary  telecommunications operations nstar communications  inc nstar com and a liquefied natural gas service company hopkinton lng corp utility operations accounted for approximately of consolidated operating revenues in  and nstar generates its revenues primarily from the sale of energy  distribution and transmission services to customers and from its unregulated businesses 
nstar s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in unit sales of kwh and mmbtu  which directly determine the level of distribution and transmission revenues recognized 
in accordance with the regulatory rate structure in which nstar operates  its recovery of energy costs are fully reconciled with the level of energy revenues currently recorded and  therefore  do not have an impact on earnings 
as a result of this rate structure  any variability in the cost of energy supply purchased will impact purchased power and cost of gas sold expense and corresponding revenues but will not affect the company s earnings 
rate settlement agreement on december   the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy mdte approved a seven year rate settlement agreement between the attorney general of massachusetts  nstar and several interveners 
the settlement agreement requires nstar electric to lower its transition rates by million from what would otherwise have been billed in  and then any change in distribution rates will be offset by an equal and opposite change in the transition rates  through for nstar gas customers  the settlement includes an adjustment to the cost of gas adjustment clause to defer recovery of approximately million beginning january nstar gas would be allowed to recover this deferral  with interest at the effective prime rate  over a twelve month period commencing no earlier than may  
table of contents major components of the agreement include a reduction in annual transition rates of million effective january  and on may   a distribution rate increase of million with a corresponding reduction in transition charges 
uncollected transition charges as a result of the reductions in transition rates will be deferred and collected through future rates with carrying charges at a rate of 
the implementation of performance based distribution rates pbr beginning january  the pbr will result in annual inflation adjusted distribution rate increases that will be offset by a decrease in transition charge prices through a earnings sharing mechanism based on nstar electric s aggregate return on equity should it exceed or fall below 
nstar electric will be permitted to collect certain safety and reliability costs through distribution rates beginning in preliminary agreement with respect to certain terms of a merger of cambridge electric  comelectric and canal into boston edison  the merger will require approval by the mdte 
a sharing of costs and benefits resulting from nstar electric s efforts to mitigate wholesale electric market inefficiencies 
the adoption of certain new service quality index performance incentives and penalties 
this settlement agreement will provide nstar with financial resources to continue with its important infrastructure improvements  while at the same time provide more certain levels of revenues than it otherwise would have available during the seven year rate period

other factors in addition to those listed here could also adversely affect nstar 
this report also describes material contingencies and critical accounting policies and estimates in this section and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and nstar encourages a review of these notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates nstar s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that require significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
nstar believes that its accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the reported results of operations  cash flows and financial position are described below 
a 
revenue recognition utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the mdte and ferc 
revenues related to the sale  transmission and distribution of delivery service are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on systematic meter readings throughout the month 
meters that are not read during a given month are estimated and trued up in a future period 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last billing date are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled electric revenue is estimated each month based on daily generation volumes territory load  estimated line losses and applicable customer rates 
unbilled natural gas revenues are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated gas losses and tariffed rates in effect 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 

table of contents nstar s non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
the level of unbilled revenues is subject to seasonal weather conditions 
electric sales volumes are typically higher in the winter and summer than in the spring or fall 
gas sales volumes are impacted by colder weather since a substantial portion of nstar s customer base uses natural gas for heating purposes 
as a result  nstar records a higher level of unbilled revenue during the seasonal periods mentioned above 
b 
regulatory accounting nstar follows accounting policies prescribed by gaap  the ferc and the mdte 
as a rate regulated company  nstar s utility subsidiaries are subject to the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
the application of sfas results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries 
nstar s energy delivery businesses remain subject to rate regulation and continue to meet the criteria for application of sfas this ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets based on the probability of current and future cash inflows 
regulatory assets represent incurred or accrued costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery from customers 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded regulatory assets of billion and billion  respectively 
nstar continuously reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
nstar expects to fully recover these regulatory assets in its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  nstar would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
c 
pension and other postretirement benefits nstar s annual pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  plan design  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors are not immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
there were no significant changes to nstar s pension benefits in  and that had an impact on recorded pension costs 
as further described in note i to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  nstar s discount rate for december  and was and aligns with market conditions and the characteristics of nstar s pension obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on its pension plan assets for remained at net of plan expenses  the same as these assumptions will have an impact on reported pension costs in future years in accordance with the cost recognition approach of sfas this impact  however  will be mitigated through nstar s regulatory accounting treatment of qualified pension and pbop costs 
see further discussion of regulatory accounting treatment below 
in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  these assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
nstar s pension plan the plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  are affected by fluctuations in the financial markets 
these fluctuations in market returns will have an impact on pension costs in future periods 

table of contents the following chart reflects the projected benefit obligation and cost sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
in thousands actuarial assumption change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation increase decrease impact on cost increase decrease pension increase in discount rate basis points   decrease in discount rate basis points   increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate basis points   decrease in discount rate basis points   increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points n a  n a not applicable management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of appropriate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s plans 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  nstar considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the target allocation for the investments over a year time period 
in  nstar kept the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at as a result of the prevailing outlook for investment returns 
this rate is presented net of both administrative expenses and investment expenses  which have averaged approximately for both and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets could vary from actual returns as well as the target allocation for investments overtime 
as such these fluctuations could impact nstar s capital resources to meet its plan contributions 
as a result of the mdte approved pension and pbop cost reconciliation rate adjustment mechanism tariff pam  nstar is authorized to recover its pension and pbop expense through this reconciling rate mechanism 
this pam removes the volatility in earnings that could result from fluctuations in market conditions and plan assumptions 
the plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of while not required to make contributions to the plan  nstar contributed million during  million of which was contributed in december this was incremental to the planned contributions for the year of million 
as a result  nstar anticipates that it will not contribute to the plan in

decommissioning cost estimates the accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will not affect nstar s results of operations or cash flows because these costs will be collected from customers through nstar s transition charge filings with the mdte 
while nstar no longer directly owns any operating nuclear power plants  nstar electric collectively owns  through its equity investments  of connecticut yankee atomic power company  of yankee atomic electric company  and of maine yankee atomic power company  collectively  the yankee companies 
periodically  nstar obtains estimates from the management of the yankee companies on the cost of decommissioning the connecticut yankee nuclear unit cy  and the yankee atomic nuclear unit ya 
these nuclear units are completely shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities 
the maine yankee nuclear unit my was notified on october  by the us nuclear regulatory commission nrc that its former plant site has been decommissioned in accordance with nrc procedures 
the nrc has amended my s license  reducing the land under the license from approximately acres to the acre independent spent fuel storage installation isfsi that includes a dry cask storage facility  and marks the first time a commercial nuclear power plant in the united states has been fully decommissioned with all plant buildings removed 
my s amended license will continue to apply to the isfsi where spent nuclear fuel from the plant s years of operation is stored 
my remains responsible for the security and protection of the isfsi and is required to maintain a radiation monitoring program at the site 
based on estimates from the yankee companies management as of december   the total remaining approximate cost for decommissioning and or security or protection of each nuclear unit is as follows million for cy  million for ya and million for my 
of these amounts  nstar electric is obligated to pay million towards the decommissioning of cy  million toward ya  and million toward my 
these amounts are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as energy contract liabilities with a corresponding regulatory asset and do not impact the current results of operations and cash flow 
these estimates may be revised from time to time based on information available to the yankee companies regarding future costs 
the yankee companies have received approval from ferc for recovery of these costs and nstar expects any additional increases to these costs to be included in future rate applications with the ferc  with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors  including nstar electric 
nstar electric would recover its share of any allowed increases from customers through the transition charge 
cy s estimated decommissioning costs increased significantly in to reflect the fact that cy is now self performing all work to complete the decommissioning of the plant due to the termination of the decommissioning contract with bechtel power corporation bechtel 
in july  cy filed with ferc for recovery of these increased costs 
in august  ferc issued an order accepting the new rates  beginning in february  subject to the outcome of a hearing and refund to allow for this recovery 
cy is currently in litigation with bechtel over the termination of its decommissioning contract 
additionally  bechtel filed a complaint against cy asserting several claims including wrongful termination 
bechtel sought to garnish the decommissioning trust and related payments 
in october  bechtel and cy entered into a stipulation under which bechtel relinquished its right to seek garnishment of the decommissioning trust and related payments in return for the potential attachment of cy s real property in connecticut with a book value of million and the escrowing of portions of the sponsors periodic payments  up to a total of million  all of which the sponsors  which include nstar electric  are scheduled to pay to cy through june  on january   the connecticut superior court issued a finding that the real property and the periodic payments were subject to attachment and garnishment  respectively  which is likely to result in the implementation of the stipulated escrowing arrangement 
cy may appeal the superior court finding 
discovery 
table of contents in the termination litigation is drawing to a close  and a trial has been scheduled for may nstar cannot predict the timing or outcome of the litigation with bechtel but does not expect a material impact on nstar s financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
on november   ferc s administrative law judge alj issued an initial decision id that found in favor of cy on all imprudence claims  finding that no disallowance was warranted 
the only adjustment the id would make in cy s proposed decommissioning charges is with respect to the escalation rate used to factor the effects of inflation into the estimate 
because the alj found that cy had dispelled all claims of imprudence  the alj did not address any party s proposed disallowance whether on the grounds of imprudence or under the settlement s budget incentive mechanism 
under ferc s rules  the id becomes final only if no party takes exception to it  if any party does take exception  the full ferc will review the id  and ferc can reach different conclusions 
cy expects that the interveners who unsuccessfully raised imprudence claims before the alj will pursue those claims before the full ferc 
during the course of carrying out the decommissioning work  ya has identified increases in the scope of soil remediation and certain other remediation required to meet environmental standards beyond the levels assumed in the estimate 
on november   ya submitted a filing to the ferc for adjustments to its rate schedules to revise the level of collections to recover the costs of completing the decommissioning of ya s retired nuclear generating plant the estimate 
the schedule for the completion of physical work will need to extend until the end of august and the costs of completing decommissioning will be approximately million greater than the estimate that formed the basis of the ferc settlement 
based on this allocation increase  nstar electric is obligated to pay million to the decommissioning of ya 
most of the cost increase relates to decommissioning expenditures that will be made during  followed by a significant reduction in those charges during the years through on january   ferc issued an order accepting the rates for filing  effective february   subject to hearing and refund 
ferc ordered the hearing held in abeyance pending the outcome of settlement procedures 
nstar electric cannot predict the timing or the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions 
derivative instruments energy contracts the electric distribution industry may contract to buy and sell electricity under option contracts  which allow the distribution company the flexibility to determine when and in what quantity to take electricity in order to align with its demand for electricity 
these contracts would normally meet the definition of a derivative instrument requiring mark to market accounting 
however  because electricity cannot be stored and utilities are obligated to maintain sufficient capacity to meet the electricity needs of its customer base  an option contract for the purchase of electricity typically qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception as described in the fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and derivative implementation group dig interpretations and  therefore  does not require mark to market accounting 
nstar accounts for its energy contracts in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
nstar electric has long term purchase power agreements that are used primarily to meet its customer obligations 
the majority of these agreements are not reflected as an asset or liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
however  based on sfas and dig interpretations  nstar  as of december   had four remaining contracts that were recorded at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
on march   nstar closed on a securitization financing for million to  in part  finance the buy out of these remaining four contracts that were classified as derivative instruments at december  these four contracts had an aggregate fair value of approximately million at december  and were therefore removed as a derivative instrument from deferred credits energy contracts  along with the offsetting regulatory asset  on the accompanying 
table of contents consolidated balance sheets 
the securitization debt obligation was recorded along with an offsetting regulatory asset to reflect the future recovery of the debt obligation through its electric distribution companies transition charge 
at december   nstar does not have any contracts that continue to be classified as derivative instruments 
refer to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  note o  for more detail on the buy out of certain purchase power contracts 
hedging agreements on february   the mdte approved a petition by nstar gas to change a portion of its gas procurement practices 
as approved  nstar gas began purchasing financial contracts based upon nymex natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for approximately one third of its natural gas purchases 
ultimately  this will minimize fluctuations in prices to nstar firm gas sales customers 
nstar gas will not take physical delivery of gas when the financial contracts are executed 
these contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments and specifically cash flow hedges under sfas  as amended by sfas accordingly  the fair value of these instruments will be recognized on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a deferred asset or liability representing amounts due from or payable to the counter parties of nstar gas 
all costs incurred are included in the firm sales cost of gas adjustment clause cgac 
therefore  nstar gas will record an offsetting regulatory asset or liability 
management has begun to implement this practice with two major financial institutions 
currently  these derivative contracts extend through april at december   nstar has recorded a liability and a corresponding regulatory asset of million reflecting the fair value of these contracts 
asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
in  nstar adopted sfas that established accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
fin clarifies when an entity would be required to recognize a liability for the fair value of an aro that is conditional on a future event if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty surrounding the timing and method of settlement that may be conditional on events occurring in the future are factored into the measurement of the liability rather than the existence of the liability 
nstar adopted fin at december   as required 
the recognition of an aro within its regulated utility businesses has no impact on nstar s earnings 
in accordance with sfas  for its rate regulated utilities  nstar established a regulatory asset to recognize future recoveries through depreciation rates for the recorded aro 
nstar has identified several plant assets in which this condition exists and is related to plant assets containing asbestos materials 
as a result  in december  nstar recognized an asset retirement cost of million as an increase in utility property  an asset retirement liability of million and a regulatory asset of million 
for comparative purposes  the pro forma aro that would have been recognized in accordance with fin as of december  and january  would have amounted to million and million  respectively 
for nstar s regulated utility businesses  the ultimate cost to remove utility plant from service cost of removal is recognized as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with approved regulatory treatment 
as of december  and  the estimated amount of the cost of removal included in regulatory liabilities was approximately million based on the estimated cost of removal component in current depreciation rates 

table of contents variable interest entities in  the fasb issued its interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised in december fin r  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities vie by business enterprises that are the primary beneficiaries 
a vie is an entity that does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the enterprise with the majority of the risks or rewards associated with the vie 
this interpretation had two effective dates december  and march  nstar has three wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries  bec funding llc  established in  bec funding ii  llc and cec funding  llc both established in  to undertake the sale of million  million and million  respectively  in notes to a special purpose trust created by two massachusetts state agencies 
nstar consolidates these entities 
as part of nstar s assessment of fin r and  for compliance at december  or  nstar reviewed the substance of these entities to determine if it is still proper to consolidate these entities 
based on its review  nstar has concluded that bec funding llc  bec funding ii  llc and cec funding  llc are vies and should continue to be consolidated by nstar 
for the march  effective date of fin r  nstar evaluated other entities with which it conducts significant transactions  including companies that supply power to nstar through its purchase power agreements 
nstar determined that it is possible that five of these companies may be considered vies 
in order to determine if these counterparties are vies and if nstar is the primary beneficiary of these counterparties  nstar concluded that it needed more information from the entities 
nstar attempted to obtain the information required and requested  in writing  these entities provide the company with the necessary information 
however  each of the entities has indicated that they will not provide the requested information as they are not contractually obligated to provide such confidential information 
since nstar was unable to obtain the necessary information and  as allowed under a scope exception in fin r  the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the consolidation of any entities with which nstar has a purchase power agreement 
subsequent to the march  effective date  nstar executed purchase power buy out or restructuring agreements with a majority of the entities from which nstar attempted to obtain additional information in order to determine if these entities are vies 
these buy out or restructuring agreements received regulatory approval in january refer to consolidated financial statements  note o  for more detail on the purchase power buy out agreements 
the remaining potential entities that may be considered vies are associated with power plants with minimal mw capacity and would not have a material effect on nstar s financial position 
as a result  nstar will no longer pursue obtaining the necessary information to determine whether it has a potential variable interest in these entities 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this standard eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the standard is effective for the first quarter of nstar is currently assessing its valuation options allowed in this standard but  preliminarily  expects this standard to impact annual pre tax earnings by approximately million 
in addition  the company will use the modified prospective approach and will utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of its compensation expense for these option grants 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this standard which is effective january   changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
the standard establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle rather than reporting a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
retrospective application requires the application of the new accounting principle to prior periods as if that principle had always been used 
accordingly  nstar will adopt this standard 
rate and regulatory proceedings a 
service quality indicators service quality indicators sqi are established performance benchmarks for certain identified measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance  customer satisfaction  and reliability and safety performance for all massachusetts utilities 
nstar electric and nstar gas are required to report annually to the mdte concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two percent of transmission and distribution revenues should performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks 
nstar monitors its service quality continuously to determine its contingent liability 
if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and is estimable  a liability is accrued 
annually  each nstar utility subsidiary makes a service quality performance filing with the mdte 
any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period that the mdte issues an order determining the amount of any such liability 
on march   nstar electric and nstar gas filed their service quality reports with the mdte that demonstrated the companies achieved sufficient levels of reliability and performance  the reports indicate that no penalty was assessable for on december   the mdte issued a formal approval of this filing 
as of december   nstar has determined that for  two of its electric subsidiaries are in a combined penalty position of approximately million relating to their applicable service quality indicators 
this penalty position is primarily due to service interruptions caused by the severe winter storms experienced earlier in the year 
as a result  nstar has recorded a liability for this obligation 
since  nstar electric and nstar gas have not been in a penalty position and therefore  the current performance is not indicative of future results 
in late  the mdte initiated a proceeding to potentially modify the service quality indicators for all massachusetts utilities 
until any modification occurs  the current sqi measures will remain in place 
nstar cannot predict the outcome or timing of this proceeding 
the settlement agreement approved by the mdte on december   established additional performance measures applicable to nstar s rate regulated subsidiaries 
nstar gas will establish and submit a service quality measure based on separate leaks per mile metrics for bare steel mains and unprotected  coated steel mains 
a specific proposal to implement this performance benchmark will be submitted to the mdte for approval by on or before july  and will be subject to a maximum penalty or incentive of up to  the settlement agreement also establishes  for nstar electric  a performance benchmark relating to poor performing circuits  with a maximum penalty or incentive of up to  b

the filings are subject to annual review and reconciliation 
on october   the mdte approved a settlement agreement between cambridge electric  comelectric and the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts to resolve issues relating to the reconciliation of transition  standard offer and basic service costs for and this settlement agreement had no material effect on nstar s consolidated results of operations  cash flows and financial condition for a reporting period 
the reconciliation of transmission costs and revenues was not resolved by settlement and will be decided by the mdte after a hearing if there is no settlement on this issue 
settlement discussions with an intervener and the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts are ongoing with respect to boston edison s and transmission reconciliation filing 
settlement discussions for the reconciliation of boston edison s costs for transition  transmission  standard offer and basic service have been delayed and will be decided by the mdte in a future hearing 
nstar electric cannot predict the timing or the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions or adjustments

wholesale market and transmission changes locational installed capacity licap on march   the ferc unanimously approved an independent system operator new england iso new england plan to implement licap  a new market rule designed to compensate wholesale generators for their capacity with an implementation date of january  ferc subsequently revised this date to no earlier than october the new licap rules require electric load serving entities lse  like nstar electric  to utilize capacity within the zones where load is served 
the current market structure allows capacity located anywhere in new england to count towards an lse s obligation  regardless of load zone 
nstar electric s service territory covers two of the five capacity zones in new england  northeastern massachusetts nema and rest of pool rop 
nema is import constrained and could potentially see higher capacity prices than the rop 
the majority of nstar electric s customers are in the nema load zone 
at this point  it is likely that the completion of nstar electric s kv transmission project will reduce transmission constraints causing capacity prices between nema and rop to converge 
this could ultimately render this locational aspect of licap a minimal factor for nstar electric s customers 
however  since the new market rules require that a certain amount of capacity be procured in the nema zone  these requirements could impact pricing for capacity in the nema zone 

table of contents additionally  several generators in the nema zone have filed with the ferc for cost of service type agreements called reliability must run agreements for the recovery of their costs prior to the implementation of licap 
the new licap rules are likely to increase overall capacity pricing levels in new england 
since the new england market as a whole is currently in a surplus position  capacity trades at a relatively low price 
one of the goals of licap is to provide a higher level of compensation to generators than what is currently being earned in this surplus market 
nstar is opposed to licap as it will likely increase the price of power to nstar electric s customers without any assurance that new capacity will be built 
as a result  nstar and other parties have appealed the ferc s licap decision in federal court 
additionally  while licap has been approved by ferc  the specific parameters of the capacity pricing mechanism are still being contested at ferc 
a final decision on these matters is expected sometime in on october   ferc issued an interim order regarding settlement procedures and directing compliance filing 
in this order  the ferc gives the parties in this proceeding a further opportunity to pursue settlement on an alternative to the licap mechanism 
ferc further directed that a settlement judge be appointed to manage the process 
on january   this settlement judge  along with other parties  requested from the ferc an extension to file the settlement agreement and accompanying documents within days  by march  nstar cannot predict the actual impact these changes will have on nstar electric and its customers  but expects all costs incurred to be fully recoverable 
in addition  the company s december  rate settlement agreement provides an incentive mechanism for the recovery of litigation costs associated with nstar s efforts to reduce wholesale energy and capacity costs and sharing of customer benefits realized from those efforts with the potential for the company to retain of any resulting savings 
regional transmission organization rto on march   the ferc decided to schedule hearings for a joint return on equity roe filing made by participating new england transmission owners  including nstar electric 
the joint roe filing among the transmission owners was made concurrently in connection with the proposed formation of an rto by the transmission owners and iso ne and is an important and integral component of the agreement to form an rto for the new england region 
among other things  the filing requested an increase in the base roe component of regional and local transmission rates to a single roe of for all regional and local transmission rates  a basis point adder to reward rto participation  and a basis point increase in regional rates as an incentive to build new transmission facilities 
ferc accepted the basis point adder for regional rates  and set for hearing the base roe and the basis point incentive adder for new transmission 
settlement negotiations before an administrative law judge were unsuccessful and hearings were held in early as a result of these hearings  on may   an initial decision was reached 
the judge found that the base roe should be and that the basis point adder for new transmission facilities should only apply to projects where innovative and less expensive technology is used 
appeal briefs by all parties  including the transmission owners  were filed with the full commission on june   and are currently awaiting the ferc s final decision 
in november  as directed by the energy policy act of  ferc proposed incentives to facilitate the maintenance and expansion of the interstate transmission system 
ferc s proposals are intended to ensure that the return on equity is sufficient to attract new transmission investment and to apply incentive based ratemaking that would ultimately accrue to the benefits of customers by ensuring reliability and by reducing the cost of delivered power 
the final rulemaking will be issued prior to august  on december   the ferc issued an order approving boston edison s october request to modify its open access transmission tariff oatt 
effective january   boston edison is allowed to include percent of construction work in progress in its rate base for transmission projects by including this amount in its local network service transmission rate formula  rather than capitalizing allowance for funds used during construction afudc charges on the entire construction expense balance 
the order is subject to boston edison filing annual reports of its long term transmission plan 
cambridge electric and comelectric filed proposed changes to their component of the iso oatt with the ferc on march  to provide for consistent application of the oatt among all nstar electric 
table of contents companies 
the new tariffs became effective on june   however  the ferc set issues raised in the proceeding for hearing 
settlement discussions with an intervener and the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts are ongoing 
nstar cannot predict the timing or the ultimate resolution of this proceeding

gas rates nstar gas generates revenues primarily through the sale and or transportation of natural gas 
gas sales and transportation services are divided into two categories firm  whereby nstar gas must supply gas and or transportation services to customers on demand  and interruptible  whereby nstar gas may  generally during colder months  temporarily discontinue service to high volume commercial and industrial customers 
sales and transportation of gas to interruptible customers do not materially affect nstar gas operating income because substantially the entire margin on such service is returned to its firm customers as rate reductions 
in addition to delivery service rates  nstar gas tariffs include a seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause cgac and a local distribution adjustment clause ldac 
the cgac provides for the recovery of all gas supply costs from firm sales customers or default service customers 
the ldac provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers 
the cgac is filed semi annually for approval by the mdte 
the ldac is filed annually for approval 
in addition  nstar gas is required to file interim changes to its cgac factor when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 
on february   the mdte approved a petition by nstar gas to change a portion of its gas procurement practices 
nstar gas will purchase financial contracts based upon nymex natural gas futures in order to lock in prices for approximately one third of its projected normal winter gas requirements 
nstar gas will not be taking physical delivery of the gas when the financial contracts are executed 
nstar gas has commenced to implement this practice after having completed contract negotiations with major financial institutions 
all costs incurred or benefits recovered will continue to be included in the cgac 
nstar gas accounts for its gas procurement contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and related interpretations 
due to fluctuations in wholesale natural gas prices  nstar gas is allowed to recover its gas supply costs from firm sales customers through the cgac 
the winter season cgac factor was revised downward from earlier in to reflect decreases in the cost of gas caused by varying market conditions 
nstar gas cgac factor received mdte approval of therm effective november  on february   an approved rate of therm was established until may  when a rate of therm was approved 
on september  and on november   due to rapid increases in natural gas prices  the mdte approved cgac factors of therm and therm  respectively 
on december   the mdte approved the rate settlement agreement which provided for a reduction in the cgac factor from therm to therm effective january  prior to  the winter season cgac factor was revised upward to reflect increases in the cost of gas caused by varying market conditions

stock split at nstar s annual meeting of shareholders held on april   shareholders approved an increase in the number of the company s authorized shares from million to million common shares 
the board of trustees subsequently approved a two for one stock split of nstar common shares  in the form of a common share dividend  for shareholders of record on may  the new shares were issued on june  the company s intent in effecting a stock split in the form of a stock dividend was to increase the number of outstanding common shares and to reduce the per share stock price thereby making it more accessible to investors 

table of contents sale of properties on december   comelectric sold a former electric generation station site in new bedford  massachusetts for million 
nstar anticipates that most of the proceeds from the sale will be applied against comelectric s transition charge 
the sale and regulatory treatment of the proceeds remains subject to mdte approval 
as a result  this transaction had no impact on current year earnings 
on september   nstar sold the assets of its wholly owned unregulated subsidiary  nstar steam corporation to a non affiliated company for million  realizing a pre tax gain on the sale of million 
also in september  nstar sold a parcel of land in cambridge massachusetts for million 
no gain was recognized from this land sale  as cambridge electric will refund these proceeds to its customers 
on april   boston edison sold a parcel of land in the city of newton  massachusetts for million  the net proceeds from the sale were used to reduce boston edison s transition charge 
the sale and the regulatory treatment of the proceeds were approved by the mdte 
as a result  this transaction had no impact on earnings 
general legal matters in the normal course of its business  nstar and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters  including civil litigation 
management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible court ordered damages  settlement amounts  and related litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of amounts accrued and amounts covered by insurance except for the item disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  note p  environmental matters 
based on the information currently available  nstar does not believe that it is probable that any such legal liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in circumstances could have a material impact on its results of operations  cash flows and financial condition for a reporting period 
rcn corporation rcn share abandonment tax treatment on december   nstar exited its investment in rcn and formally abandoned its million shares of rcn common stock 
as a result  nstar recorded a pre tax charge of approximately million  or per share reflecting the writedown of its investment to zero as of december  nstar determined that the abandonment at that time was the most tax efficient  cost effective and expedient means to exit its rcn investment 
nstar also determined that the benefit of a tax realization event at that time and in that manner outweighed any benefit that it would likely realize from any other alternative  including the future sale of such shares in an orderly fashion consistent with all laws  rules and regulations 
as a result of the rcn share abandonment  the company claimed an ordinary loss on its tax return for this item 
the ordinary loss tax treatment resulted in the company realizing the benefits represented by the tax asset recorded on its books that resulted from the previous write down of this investment for financial reporting purposes 
the requirement for a tax valuation allowance recorded prior to this abandonment  therefore  is no longer applicable 
accordingly  the company reversed this reserve as of december  it is nstar s tax accounting policy to not recognize tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position until it is probable that such tax benefit will ultimately be realized 
since nstar is under continuous audit by the internal revenue service irs  nstar consulted with its independent tax advisors and determined that it could not conclude that it is probable that the tax deduction related to the abandonment of its rcn investment will be sustained 
accordingly  nstar accrued a tax reserve so as to not record the tax benefit of the uncertain tax position 
the company believes it is more likely than not that it is entitled to this ordinary loss deduction  but expects the irs will review this transaction and it is possible that the irs will disagree with the company s position 
in accordance with the company s tax policy as it relates to uncertain tax positions  nstar established a loss contingency of approximately million at december  this amount 
table of contents represents the tax impact to the company should the ordinary loss ultimately be recharacterized to a capital loss and would be reclassified as a tax valuation allowance 
during  the company recognized approximately million in tax benefits related to capital tax gain transactions 
as a result  the company reduced its tax loss contingency by a corresponding amount 
therefore  as of december   the tax loss contingency is approximately million 
this contingent liability is recorded as part of deferred credits other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if the company s position is not upheld  the company may be required to make future cash expenditures to the irs that may impact nstar s cash requirements in future periods

other events impact from hurricanes during the summer of  hurricanes katrina and rita impacted natural gas production  processing and transportation assets in the gulf of mexico gom 
none of these facilities are owned by nstar  however  nstar depends on resources in the gom for supply of natural gas in addition to storage supplies which were not affected by the storms 
one of the facilities impacted is the tennessee gas pipeline tgp line  which is under repair 
tgp s initial assessment is that this pipeline will be out of service for three to six months 
nstar has approximately of its peak design winter need supplied by the line 
nstar has contracted to replace this supply with canadian supplies 
nstar is actively involved with other utilities  pipelines  suppliers and regulators in assessing the gom supplies and will continue to respond as necessary 
nstar cannot predict the impact gom may have on supply available during the remainder of this winter heating season 
energy prices it is possible that the recent unprecedented rise in energy prices  resulting from hurricanes katrina and rita and global energy conditions  may have a negative impact on electric and gas demand and therefore on nstar s future electric and gas sales

table of contents short term financing activities nstar s short term debt increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase resulted primarily from additional working capital needs that reflected the significant increase in contributions to nstar s pension and postretirement benefit plans and the financing of the retirement  at maturity  of boston edison s million variable rate notes on october  long term financing activities on march   two wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries  bec funding ii  llc and cec funding llc  issued million and million  respectively  in notes to a special purpose trust created by two massachusetts state agencies 
the trust then concurrently issued a total of million of rate reduction certificates to the public 
these certificates represent fractional  undivided beneficial interests in the notes issued by bec funding ii  llc and cec funding  llc and are secured by a portion of the transition charge assessed on boston edison s and comelectric s retail customers as permitted under the massachusetts electric industry restructuring act and authorized by the mdte 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison and comelectric  respectively 
the assets and revenues of bec funding ii  llc and cec funding  llc  including without limitation  the transition property  are owned solely by bec funding ii  llc and cec funding  llc  and are not available to creditors of boston edison  comelectric or nstar

these agreements constituted approximately mw of the remaining mw of purchased power commitments  and reduced the amount of above market energy costs that nstar electric will incur and collect from its customers through its transition charges 
as of december   four of these agreements received mdte approval and were recognized 
two of the four agreements require nstar electric to make monthly payments through december totaling approximately million 
the other two agreements require nstar electric to make monthly payments through september totaling approximately million 
these buy out restructuring agreements  once completed  provide no economic benefit to nstar electric and  therefore  the agreements contract termination costs were recorded on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on january   nstar electric received approval from the mdte for an additional four agreements that were anticipated to be completed by february these four agreements were binding as of december  but were contingent upon regulatory approval 
since the contingency was removed during february  nstar recorded the contract termination cost as of december  one of the four agreements requires nstar electric to make net monthly payments through september totaling approximately million 
the other three agreements require nstar electric to make net monthly payments through september totaling approximately million 
nstar electric anticipates making these cash payments from funds generated from operations and will be fully recovered through nstar electric s transition charge

nstar electric has recorded a corresponding regulatory asset to reflect the full future recovery of these payments through its transition charge 
this recognition represents a non cash increase to assets and liabilities 

table of contents also in january  the mdte approved the remaining four contract buy outs with two suppliers that reduced the overall amount of transition costs to be paid for above market contracts 
these contracts are buy out arrangements whereby nstar electric has made contract termination payments in full release of its obligation under the purchase power agreements 
on august   nstar electric filed with the mdte a proposed financing plan that sought approval for full recovery of these buy out costs and the issuance of million of transition property securitization bonds to provide the funds for these buy out agreements

under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  boston edison is required to maintain a consolidated maximum total debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than at all times  excluding transition property securitization certificates  and excluding accumulated other comprehensive income loss from common equity

nstar gas is not required to seek approval from ferc to issue short term debt 
on june   nstar filed an s registration statement with the sec for the purpose of registering two million common shares in connection with the nstar dividend reinvestment and direct common shares purchase plan 
the registration statement became effective on july  since the effective date  nstar has issued approximately  and  shares under this registration and received approximately million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  nstar issued approximately  shares as part of its share incentive plan 
no cash was received from this issuance 
historically  nstar and its subsidiaries have had a variety of external sources of financing available  as indicated above  at favorable rates and terms to finance its external cash requirements 
however  the availability of such financing at favorable rates and terms depends heavily upon prevailing market conditions and nstar s or its subsidiaries financial condition and credit ratings 
nstar s goal is to maintain a capital structure that preserves an appropriate balance between debt and equity 
based on nstar s key cash resources available as discussed above  management believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its current and projected requirements 
performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements nstar electric has entered into short term power purchase agreements to meet its entire basic service supply obligation  other than to its largest customers  for the period january  through june  and for of its obligation  other than to these large customers  for the second half of nstar electric has entered into short term power purchase agreements to meet its entire basic service supply obligation for large customers through march these agreements are for a term of three to twelve months but could change as a result of nstar s recently approved rate settlement agreement 
nstar electric currently is recovering payments it is making to suppliers from its customers 
most of nstar electric s power suppliers are either investment grade companies or are subsidiaries of larger companies with investment grade or better credit ratings 
in accordance with nstar s internal credit policy  and to minimize nstar electric risk in the event the supplier encounters financial difficulties or otherwise fails to perform  nstar has financial assurances and guarantees that include both parental guarantees and letters of credit in place from the parent company of the supplier 
in addition  under these agreements  in the event that the supplier or its parent guarantor fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating  it is required to provide additional security for performance of its obligations 
in view of current volatility in the energy supply industry  nstar electric is unable to determine whether its suppliers or their parent guarantors will become subject to financial difficulties  or whether these financial assurances and guarantees are sufficient 
in the event the supplier or its guarantor does not provide the required additional security within the required time frames  nstar electric may then terminate the agreement 
in such event  nstar may be required to secure alternative sources of supply at higher or lower prices than provided under the 
table of contents terminated agreements 
some of these agreements include a reciprocal provision  where in the event that an nstar electric distribution company receives a downgrade  that company could be required to provide additional security for performance  such as a letter of credit 
additionally  the hedging agreements that nstar gas enters into related to its gas purchases have a termination clause for either party in the event the credit rating of the other falls below a stipulated level 
virtually all of nstar gas firm gas supply agreements are short term less than one year and utilize market based  monthly indexed pricing mechanisms so the financial risk to the company would be minimal if a supplier were to fail to perform 
however  in the event that a firm supplier does fail to perform under its firm gas supply agreement  the company would be entitled to any positive difference between the monthly supply price and the cost of replacement supplies 
the cost of gas procured for firm gas sales customers is recovered through a semi annual cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
under mdte regulations  interim adjustments to the cost of gas may also be requested when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 
nstar gas continually evaluates the financial stability of current and prospective gas suppliers 
firm suppliers are required to have and maintain investment grade credit ratings or financial assurances and guarantees that include both parental guarantees and letters of credit in place from the parent company of the supplier and the firm gas supply agreements allow either party to require financial assurance  or  if necessary  contract termination in the event that either party is downgraded below investment grade level and is unable to provide financial assurance acceptable to nstar gas 
financial and performance guarantees on a limited basis  nstar and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties 
such agreements include letters of credit  surety bonds  and other guarantees 
at december   outstanding guarantees totaled million as follows in thousands letters of credit surety bonds other guarantees total guarantees letters of credit in may  boston edison issued a million standby letter of credit to the general contractor of boston edison s kv project 
the amount of the standby letter of credit was reduced to million on february  the contractor will be able to draw upon the letter of credit if boston edison does not comply with the payment terms of the respective executed construction agreement  signed by both parties 
nstar believes that it is very unlikely that a draw will be made on the standby letter of credit 
in addition  nstar issued a million letter of credit for the benefit of a third party  as trustee in connection with the notes of one of its subsidiaries 
the letter of credit is available if the subsidiary has insufficient funds to pay the debt service requirements 
as of december   there have been no amounts drawn under these letters of credit 
surety bonds as of december   certain of nstar s subsidiaries have purchased a total of million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses  permits and rights of way in various municipalities 
in addition  nstar and certain of its subsidiaries have purchased approximately million in 
table of contents workers compensation self insurer bonds 
these bonds support the guarantee by nstar and certain of its subsidiaries to the commonwealth of massachusetts required as part of the company s workers compensation self insurance program 
on january   nstar and certain of its subsidiaries executed indemnity agreements to provide additional financial security to its bond company in the form of a contingent letter of credit to be triggered in the event of a downgrade in the future of nstar s senior note rating to below bbb by s p and or to below baa by moody s 
these indemnity agreements cover both the performance surety bonds and workers compensation bonds 
other nstar and its subsidiaries have also issued million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the hydro quebec transmission companies 
management believes the likelihood nstar would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote 
contingencies environmental matters nstar subsidiaries face possible liabilities as a result of involvement in several multi party disposal sites  state regulated sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation 
nstar generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for the majority of these sites 
during the second quarter of  the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc issued its decision in one of the environmental contamination matters 
in  a superior court had issued a decision favorable to boston edison that put the burden of proof on the plaintiffs to determine boston edison s liability for contamination 
the sjc s decision reversed the superior court s ruling and held that the plaintiffs in this matter are allowed to seek joint and several liability against the defendants  including boston edison 
the case was remanded back to the superior court for trial 
on october   boston edison reached a settlement in principle with the plaintiffs in this matter 
it is anticipated that the appropriate settlement documents will be finalized in february and filed with the superior court shortly thereafter 
the settlement is subject to a day public comment period at which point we expect the superior court to approve and enter final judgment 
boston edison anticipates paying within days of the final judgment approximately million which approximates the amount previously reserved for this matter 
boston edison will vigorously attempt to recover monies from the other responsible third parties  including recovery from its insurance carrier 
as of december  and  nstar had reserves of million and million  respectively  for all potential environmental sites  including the site specified in the paragraph above 
this estimated recorded liability is based on an evaluation of all currently available facts with respect to all of its sites 
in addition  based on a legal opinion from the company s environmental counsel  it is probable that boston edison will recover  at a minimum  approximately million from other parties 
as a result  boston edison recorded a receivable in the second quarter that will ultimately offset the company s obligation 
management believes that the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on nstar s results of operation  cash flows or its financial position 
nstar gas is participating in the assessment or remediation of certain former manufactured gas plant mgp sites and alleged mgp waste disposal locations to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and whether nstar gas may be responsible for remedial action 
the mdte has approved recovery of costs associated with mgp sites over a year period  without carrying costs 
as of december  and  nstar recorded a liability of approximately million and million  respectively  as estimates for site cleanup costs for several mgp sites for which nstar gas was previously cited as a potentially responsible party 
a corresponding regulatory asset was recorded that reflects the future rate recovery for these costs 

table of contents estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or nstar s responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved 
nstar s ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates 
based on nstar s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities  existing legal requirements and regulatory policies  nstar does not believe that these environmental remediation costs will have a material adverse effect on nstar s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
capital spending commitments in the second quarter of  nstar began construction of a switching station in stoughton  massachusetts and a kv transmission line that will connect the switching station to south boston 
as of december   construction that is part of this project is also in progress on the expansion of two existing substations 
to date  this project is approximately complete 
this transmission line is expected to ensure continued reliability of electric service and improve power import capability in the northeast massachusetts area 
this project is expected to be placed in service during the summer of a substantial portion of the cost of this project will be shared by other utilities in new england based on iso new england s approval and will be recovered by nstar through wholesale and retail transmission rates 
as of december   nstar has contractual construction cost commitments of approximately million related to this project 
employees and employee relations as of december   nstar had approximately  employees  including approximately  or  who are represented by three units covered by separate collective bargaining contracts 
nstar s labor contract with local of the utility workers union of america  afl cio  expired on may  after a brief strike  on may   nstar management and union officials agreed upon a new four year contract expiring june  the union members  which represent approximately  employees  ratified the contract on may  approximately employees  represented by local  united steelworkers of america  afl cio  have a contract that expires on march  management and union officials are currently negotiating a new contract 
management cannot predict the outcome of this negotiation 
approximately employees of advanced energy systems matep subsidiary are represented by local  the international union of operating engineers  afl cio  under a contract that expires on september  management believes it has satisfactory relations with its employees 
fair value of financial instruments carrying amounts and fair values of long term indebtedness excluding notes payable  including current maturities as of december  and were as follows in thousands carrying amount fair value carrying amount fair value long term indebtedness including current maturities as discussed in the following section  nstar s exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although nstar has material commodity purchase contracts  these instruments are not subject to market risk 
nstar s electric and gas distribution subsidiaries have rate making mechanisms that allow for the recovery of energy supply costs from customers  who make commodity purchases from nstar s electric and gas subsidiaries  rather than from the competitive market 
all energy supply costs incurred by nstar s electric and gas subsidiaries to provide electricity for retail customers purchasing basic service or retail gas customers are recovered on a fully reconciling basis 
however  nstar s exposure to financial market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
nstar is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily based on levels of short term debt outstanding
