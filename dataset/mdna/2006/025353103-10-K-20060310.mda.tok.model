we cannot determine the outcome of the litigation 
however  a disruption or termination of the service agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating trends and results of operations 
in addition  we expect to incur ongoing expenses in connection with the pdg litigation 
affiliation summary when affiliating with a dental practice  we acquire selected assets and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the affiliated practice is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 
during  and we completed ten  five and seven transactions in which we acquired non clinical dental assets  respectively  and simultaneously entered into year service agreements in two of these transactions 
the remaining transactions became subject to existing service agreements 
these affiliations resulted in the addition of dental facilities and operatories 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental practices and acquisitions of companies that would expand our business capabilities 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater or less than we have achieved in recent years 
revenue overview net revenue our consolidated net revenue includes management fees earned by us pursuant to the terms of the service agreements with the affiliated practices  as well as reimbursement of clinic expenses paid by us on their behalf 
as part of our objective of being the leading provider of services to dental group practices  we are continually expanding our resources and capabilities  including vertical integration of ancillary dental activities 
as a result  our net revenue includes fees from dental laboratory services and for professional services rendered to dental benefit providers relating to the arrangement for the provision of care to patients 

table of contents the following table provides the components of our net revenue for  and in thousands reimbursement of expenses business service fees revenue earned under service agreements other revenue net revenue fees earned under service agreements include reimbursement of expenses incurred by us on behalf of the affiliated practices in connection with the operation and administration of dental facilities and service fees charged to the affiliated practices pursuant to the terms of the service agreements for management services provided and capital committed by us 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement of us and the affiliated practice in a formal planning process 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a monthly fee equal to the prior year service fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the increase of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the prior year 
in no event  however  under these service agreements will the total service fee be greater than the affiliated practice s patient revenue less expenses 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under a certain service agreement  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the planned amount for the current year 
in all instances  the service fee is negotiated at fair market value for services provided and capital committed by us to the affiliated practices 
expenses incurred by us for the operation and administration of the dental facilities include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
for additional information on components of our net revenue  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
patient revenue of the affiliated practices although we do not control  nor own any equity interests in  the affiliated practices and  accordingly  do not consolidate their financial statements with ours  we believe it is important to understand their revenue 
most of the operating expenses incurred by us are on behalf of the affiliated practices in the operation of dental facilities 
these expenses are significantly affected by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
as used in this discussion  patient revenue represents revenue reported by the affiliated practices earned from the provision of dental care to their patients 
patient revenue is not a measure of our financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles because it is not our revenue 
it is however  a financial measure we use  along with other financial measures  to monitor the performance of the affiliated practices and to help identify and analyze operating trends which may impact our business 
the affiliated practices generate revenue from treating patients and receive payment from patients and dental benefit providers  or payors  under fee for service  ppo plans and managed care capitation plans 
patient revenue reflects the amounts billed by an affiliated practice at its established rates reduced by any contractual adjustments and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
contractual adjustments represent discounts off established rates negotiated pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the following table provides the aggregate payor mix of the affiliated practices for the years ended december fee for service ppo and dental referral plans capitated managed care plans 
table of contents after collection of fees from patients and third party insurers for the provision of dental care and payment to us of our service fee and reimbursement of clinic expenses incurred by us on their behalf  the amounts remaining are used by the affiliated practices for compensation of dentists and  in certain states  hygienists and or dental assistants who are employed by the affiliated practices

same market patient revenue growth for excludes platform affiliations that occurred after january  amounts retained by affiliated practices increased in and in the increase in was attributable to greater profitability levels at the affiliated practices 
the increase in is primarily due to practice affiliations during the periods of comparison where the affiliated practices are required to employ the hygienists and dental assistants

during  the increase was attributable to an increase in same market net revenue growth and incremental net revenue earned from our platform affiliation completed in february  offset by a decrease in other revenue 
the decrease in other revenue in and is primarily attributable to a decrease in dental laboratory fees as a result of an increasing percentage of fees being earned from our affiliated dental groups 
the percentage of lab fees being earned from our affiliated dental groups has increased from in to in to in net revenue derived from our service agreement with pdg  pa  the affiliated practice at park dental  represented approximately   and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
net revenue from our service agreement with wisconsin dental group  sc  the affiliated practice at forward dental  represented approximately of our consolidated net revenue for each of the years  and no other service agreement or customers accounted for greater than of our consolidated net revenue 

table of contents salaries and benefits salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working at the dental facilities  dental laboratory and local and regional shared service centers 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the hygienists and dental assistants 
the personnel at the local and regional shared service centers support the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in and in the decrease in was primarily attributable to staff productivity increases 
the decrease in was primarily attributable to staff productivity increases  as well as the impact of our affiliation with premier dental partners which is located in missouri  a state where the affiliated practice is required to employ the hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned 
lab fees and dental supplies lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of net revenue was in  in and in the decrease as a percentage of net revenue in was primarily related to increased utilization of our dental laboratory by the affiliated practices and to a lesser extent our continued focus on managing dental supplies expenses 
these expenses are largely impacted by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices and as a percentage of patient revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
office occupancy office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs  such as utilities  associated with dental facilities  dental laboratory and the local and regional shared service centers 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office and administrative space in each particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue was in and in both and the decrease in was primarily attributable to higher utilization of our dental facilities as evidenced by a higher level of patient revenue per facility in in  we relocated and or expanded sixteen facilities 
in  we completed one de novo facility and relocated and or expanded nineteen facilities 
in  we completed one de novo facility and relocated and or expanded seventeen facilities 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include non employment related insurance expense  professional fees  marketing costs and other general and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue were in  and in and the increase in was the result of an additional  of minnesota care tax expense  representing a increase over  due to a rate increase and additional revenues for the affiliated practices in minnesota 
this was partially offset by a  reduction to amounts accrued for estimated losses below insurance retention levels for professional liability insurance due to revised actuarial estimates 

table of contents general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation and travel expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office and professional fees  including legal and accounting 
general corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue were in  in and in the increase in was primarily due to costs for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  new hires at our corporate office  increases in our incentive compensation plan and the favorable impact of a legal settlement during which reduced general corporate expense 
the decrease in as a percent of net revenue was due to a leveraging of our general corporate expenses 
we anticipate general corporate expenses as a percent of net revenue will increase substantially  approximately  net of tax  for all outstanding options as of december   due to the inclusion of compensation expense recognized in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment effective january  we estimate the compensation expense for stock option grants awarded in the first quarter to be approximately  net of tax 
depreciation depreciation expense  including amortization of leasehold improvements  as a percentage of net revenue was in and  and in the increase in depreciation expense as a percent of net revenue in primarily relates to our increased investment in leasehold improvements and dental equipment and  to a lesser extent  amortization of software development costs relating to improvis which began in the fourth quarter 
we expect to continue to invest in the development of new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities in accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation may increase in at a rate greater than our net revenue 
amortization of service agreements and other intangible assets amortization expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in and the decrease in was a result of a greater proportion of our net revenue earned from existing affiliated practices as opposed to entering into additional affiliations 
based on an evaluation of historical financial trends  we have determined that the intangible assets associated with certain in market affiliations which were combined with existing affiliated practices are presently expected to generate future cash flows for a longer period than previously estimated 
accordingly  we increased the amortization period relating to these intangible assets 
as a result  the amortization period for certain previously completed in market affiliations was increased to years 
this change in estimate impacted of our intangible assets and had the effect of reducing amortization expense for by approximately  or  net of tax 
this change in estimate is expected to reduce amortization expense by approximately  or  net of tax  for the full year amortization of intangible assets will likely increase in the future as a result of additional intangible assets recorded in connection with future affiliations and  if applicable and earned  contingent payments on already completed affiliations 
earnings from operations earnings from operations increased from  or of net revenue  in to  or of net revenue  in and increased to  or of net revenue  in earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased in primarily due to increased productivity and facility utilization as a result of higher same market growth rates and to a lesser extent improved management of lab fees and dental supplies expenses 
in this was partially offset by increased general corporate expenses as a result of additional personnel at our corporate office and accounting fees incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased in primarily due to increased productivity as a result of higher same market growth rates and leveraging of corporate expenses and other costs 
interest expense net interest expense decreased from  in to  in and increased to  in the decrease in was due to reduced debt levels  a reduction in borrowing spread over libor and to a lesser extent a lower libor interest rate as compared to the prior year 
the increase in was due to increased borrowings as well as an increase in libor interest rates 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for more information related to our credit facility 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in and in the decrease in and was due to a reduction in state tax rates 
net earnings as a result of the foregoing  net earnings increased from  or of net revenue  in to  or of net revenue  in and to  or of net revenue  in in  net earnings reflected an increase in earnings from operations  a decrease in interest expense  and a decrease in our effective tax rate 
in  net earnings reflects our increased earnings from operations and a reduction in our effective tax rate  offset by increased borrowing costs 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  principally from operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
we have  in the past  also used proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of subordinated promissory notes to finance certain capital needs  but have not done so in recent years 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items and a decrease in receivables due from affiliated practices 
the decrease in receivables due from affiliated practices  which totaled  was primarily due to better working capital management and a continued focus on receivables management at the affiliated practices 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of the affiliated practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  in addition  operating cash flow decreased in in comparison to due to a federal income tax benefit for bonus depreciation of approximately  recognized in from depreciable assets acquired before january  in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items and increases in accrued expenses offset by an increase in amounts receivable from the affiliated practices 
we also realized a tax benefit of  during  compared to  in  from the exercise of employee stock options 
as of january   tax benefits from the exercises of employee stock options will be reflected in financing activities following the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment 
for the years ended december  and  cash used for investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
cash used for affiliations  net of cash acquired  was  and  for and  respectively 
in we completed five affiliations for aggregate consideration of  in cash and  in deferred payments 
in  we completed ten affiliations for aggregate consideration of  in cash and up to  in deferred payments 
in  we completed an affiliation which included a future contingent payment based on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes in excess of a predetermined threshold for the twelve months ended december  less capital expenditures incurred from the date of affiliation 
the amount of the contingent payment was  and was paid in in future years  this contingent payment will result in additional annual amortization expense of  capital expenditures were  and  for and  respectively 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with one de novo dental facility and the relocation and or expansion of nineteen dental facilities 
capital expenditures for included costs associated with one de novo dental facility and the relocation and or expansion of seventeen dental facilities 
we expect capital expenditures in to be at similar levels as due to the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities  our on going facility maintenance capital expenditure program and investment in several information technology projects 
for the year ended december   cash used for financing activities amounted to  and for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities amounted to  cash used for financing activities in resulted from net repayments under our revolving line of credit of  repayment of indebtedness of  and payment of debt issuance costs as part of entering into a new credit facility of  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan of  and  respectively 
cash provided from financing activities in resulted from advances of  under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and from our employee stock purchase plan of  and  respectively  partially offset by  in subordinated debt payments and payments of debt issuance costs of  during we have a  revolving credit facility that we use for general corporate purposes  including working capital  acquisitions and affiliations and capital expenditures 
the facility had an original maturity date of october and maximum borrowings under the line were scheduled to decrease to  in october on february   we amended our credit facility as a result 
table of contents of our improved financial position and favorable credit markets and extended the maturity to february  with a scheduled reduction in maximum borrowings to  in february amendments to the original facility included a decrease in the interest margin and a decrease in our commitment fees 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin is based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges from to for prime borrowings and to for libor borrowings 
at december   the libor interest rate under the credit facility  including borrowing margin  was approximately and the prime interest rate under the credit facility was 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of our credit facility ranging from to 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain items  and are secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to comply with financial and other covenants  including minimum net worth  leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum capital expenditures as defined by the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of december  the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  and we had a stand by letter of credit amounting to  at december  the unused balance under this line as of december  was  and based on borrowing covenants  reduced by the stand by letter of credit   was available for borrowing 
our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
historically  we have used a combination of cash  debt  and to a lesser extent  common stock as consideration for past affiliations 
in recent years  the consideration paid has consisted of cash 
we intend to continue to use cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility to provide consideration for future affiliations 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient or debt financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  we may have to issue or sell equity securities or  if unsuccessful  modify our affiliation strategy 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental practices that would expand our business as well as possible acquisitions of businesses that would broaden our business capabilities 
the number of practice affiliations over the next twelve months could be at levels greater than we have achieved during each of the past two years 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and acquisitions for at least the next year 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases total in addition to these contractual obligations  future interest payments relating to our long term debt are fixed at a rate of and are due as follows in  due in  in future interest obligations relating to our revolving credit facility are not determinable as the interest rate is variable and the agreement does not include a required principal repayment schedule 
we have not historically hedged our interest rate exposure and the principal balance fluctuates daily 
for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating lease payments include amounts which are to be reimbursed to us pursuant to the terms of our service agreements with the affiliated practices 
the amounts to be reimbursed by the affiliated practices are  and are due as follows  in   in   in  and  thereafter 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of receivables due from affiliated practices  goodwill  other intangible assets and amounts for potential losses below retention levels on certain insurance coverages 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and in certain instances actuarial studies conducted by third parties  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 

table of contents valuation of receivables due from affiliated practices the company s carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated practices requires management to assess the collectability of our business service fees 
our service fees are dependent on the economic viability of the affiliated practices based on actual and expected future financial performance including collectability of the affiliated practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the affiliated practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at patient revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
the affiliated practices provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated practices patient receivables would be required which may impact the collectability of receivables due from affiliated practices 
to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated practices 
service agreements and intangible assets the company s affiliations with dental group practices are not business combinations  and as such  do not result in recognition of goodwill 
the company recognizes capitalized service agreement costs which are accounted for as definite lived intangible assets acquired in other than a business combination  and recorded at fair value 
in determining the fair value of a service agreement recognized in connection with an affiliation  management estimates the timing  amount and value of future expected cash flows 
these service agreements have contractual terms of years but the asset is generally amortized on a straight line basis over a period of years 
customer relationship intangible assets associated with the acquisition of dental laboratories are amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the related affiliated practice is required  at the company s option in nearly all instances  to purchase the remaining unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  purchase other assets at the greater of fair value or book value  and assume leases and other liabilities related to the performance of the company s obligations under the service agreement 
management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangible assets may be impaired  by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows of the asset to its carrying value 
if impairment were determined  an appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset would be made to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
fair value is determined by calculating the projected discounted operating net cash flows of the asset using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
the company has not recorded any impairment charges or write downs on definite lived intangibles as of december  insurance we maintain various insurance coverages for our business  including property casualty  business interruption  workers compensation and general liability  among others 
in addition  the affiliated practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
several of these insurance programs have retention levels in which we and the affiliated practices are financially obligated for insured losses below certain financial thresholds before the insurer is financially obligated for insured losses 
we maintain reserves for losses below retention levels for certain of these programs 
reserves are based upon estimates provided by third party actuaries or by individual case basis valuations 
changes in trends of loss severity or loss frequency may affect the calculation of these estimates and create the need for subsequent adjustments to estimated loss reserves

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins  ranging from to based upon our debt coverage ratio 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum 
we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
