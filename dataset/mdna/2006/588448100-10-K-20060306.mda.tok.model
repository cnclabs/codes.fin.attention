the preparation of such consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about financial statement amounts 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
merchants significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses  which is established through the provision for loan losses  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore evaluates it for adequacy each quarter 
management considers factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms  and estimated fair value of collateral that secures the loans 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different allowance for loan losses 
income taxes merchants estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this involves estimating merchants actual current tax exposure  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in merchants consolidated balance sheets 
merchants must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december  no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was deemed necessary by management 
interest income recognition on loans interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loan 
merchants policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest  and to reverse any uncollected interest recorded on loans  when scheduled payments become contractually past due in excess of days unless the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured

credit quality and allowance for loan losses stringent credit quality is a major strategic focus of merchants 
merchants low level of problem assets is evidence of the success of this effort 
although merchants has been successful to date in minimizing its problem assets  there is no assurance that it will not have increased levels of problem assets in the future 
merchants generally places loans that become or more days past due in nonaccrual status  if  in the opinion of management  the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured  loans may continue to accrue interest and be left in this category 
included in this category are loans which have reached maturity and have not been renewed on a timely basis  for reasons other than financial capacity to pay 
the following table summarizes merchants nonperforming loans npl and nonperforming assets npa as of december   through december  in thousands nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets npl to total loans npa to total loans plus oreo excluded from the balances above are approximately million of internally classified loans  compared to million of internally classified loans at december  million of these internally classified loans were sold during as part of management s efforts to improve credit quality

management maintains an internal listing that includes all criticized and classified loans 
the list is reviewed and updated monthly 
the list make up is dynamic with individual loans migrating off and on the list 
some of these loans may migrate to non performing status during the course of the next twelve months 
management believes that classified loans have well defined weaknesses which  if left unattended  could lead to collection problems 
the oversight process on these loans includes an active risk management approach 
a management committee reviews the status of these loans each quarter and determines or confirms the appropriate risk rating and accrual status 
the findings of this review process are instrumental in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
discussion of events affecting nonperforming assets historically  merchants has worked closely with borrowers to collect obligations and when necessary pursued more vigorous collection efforts 
merchants credit department and commercial loan officers work together to address collection strategies for nonperforming assets 
the following schedule shows the components of nonperforming assets as of the end of each of the previous five quarters in thousands december  september  june  march  december  nonaccrual loans loans past due days or more and still accruing restructured loans other real estate owned total nonaccrual loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  during management identified million in new nonperforming loans 
based on continued performance approximately thousand in nonaccrual loans were returned to accrual status  principal payments of approximately million were collected  approximately thousand of nonaccrual loans were charged off and million in nonaccrual loans were sold 
policies and procedures related to the accrual of interest income merchants recognizes income on earning assets on an accrual basis  which calls for the recognition of income as earned  rather than when it is collected 
merchants policy is to classify a loan days or more past due with respect to principal or interest as a nonaccruing loan  unless the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccruing loans  and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is typically charged against current income 
a loan remains in nonaccruing status until the factors which suggest doubtful collectibility no longer exist  the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible  and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in those cases where a nonaccruing loan is secured by real estate  merchants can  and may  initiate foreclosure proceedings 
the result of such action will either be to cause repayment of the loan with the proceeds of a foreclosure sale or t o give merchants possession of the collateral in order to manage a future resale of the real estate 
foreclosed property is recorded at the lower of its cost or estimated fair value  less any estimated costs to sell 
any cost in excess of the estimated fair value on the transfer date is charged to the allowance  while further declines in market values are recorded as oreo expense in the statement of income 
loan portfolio monitoring merchants board of directors grants each loan officer the authority to originate loans on behalf of merchants  subject to certain limitations 
the board of directors also establishes restrictions regarding the types of loans that may be granted and the distribution of loan types within merchants portfolio  and sets loan authority limits for each lender 
these authorized lending limits are reviewed at least annually and are based upon the lender s knowledge and experience 
loan requests that exceed a lender s authority require the signature of merchants credit division manager  senior loan officer  and or merchants president 
all extensions of credit of million or greater to any one borrower  or related party interest  are reviewed and approved by the loan committee of merchants board of directors 
the directors loan committee and the credit department regularly monitor merchants loan portfolio 
the entire loan portfolio as well as individual loans is reviewed for loan performance  creditworthiness  and strength of documentation 
merchants monitors loan concentrations by individual borrowers  industries and loan types 
as part of the annual credit policy review process  targets are set by loan type for the total portfolio 
merchants has hired external loan review firms to assist in monitoring both the commercial and residential loan portfolios 
during the commercial loan review firm performed three comprehensive reviews of merchants loan portfolio  and reviewed approximately in dollar volume of merchants commercial loan portfolio 
credit risk ratings are assigned to commercial loans at origination and are routinely reviewed by both management and the external loan review firms 
all loan officers are required to service their loan portfolios and account relationships 
as necessary  loan officers or the credit department personnel take remedial actions to assure full and timely payment of loan balances 
allowance for loan losses the allowance is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date 
merchants reviews the adequacy of the allowance quarterly 
factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  risk rating composition  current economic and real estate market conditions and their effect on the borrowers  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of properties that secure impaired loans 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  consisting of a review of the following key elements a specific reserve for loans identified as impaired  a general reserve for the various loan portfolio classifications  the unallocated allowance for loan losses impaired loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that merchants will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment on collateral dependent loans  which comprise a significant majority of merchants loan portfolio  is measured based on the fair value of collateral 
unsecured loans are measured for impairment based on expected future cash flows  discounted at the historical effective interest rate 
loans continue to be classified as impaired unless they are brought fully current and the collection of scheduled interest and principal is considered probable 
merchants performs detailed and extensive reviews on these loans and on larger credits and problematic credits identified on the watched asset list  nonperforming asset listings and internal credit rating reports 
through these reviews merchants is able to determine if a loan requires a specific allocation of the allowance or is permanently impaired and needs to be charged down 
loans are evaluated by looking at the fair market value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or measuring the net present value of the expected future cash flows using the loan s original effective interest rate 
if the loan is impaired further analysis is performed to determine if the impairment is permanent 
if the impairment is deemed permanent the loan is charged down to its net realizable value through the allowance 
the general allowance is a percentage based reflection of historical loss experience and assigns a required allowance allocation by loan classification based on a fixed percentage of all outstanding loan balances 
the general allowance employs a risk rating model that grades loans based on their general characteristics of credit quality and relative risk 
for pass rated loans  appropriate allowance levels are estimated based on judgments regarding the historical loss experience  current economic trends  trends in the portfolio mix  volume and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans 
as of december   the allowance related to pass rated loans was approximately million 
for loans rated special mention or substandard  the allowance allocation is increased  as of december   the allowance related to special mention or substandard loans was million 
the above evaluations combine the estimates of management and of external loan review sources 
after the specific and general reserves previously identified a portion of the allowance remains unallocated 
the unallocated allowance recognizes a measurement imprecision in the valuation and general components of the allowance and management s evaluation of various other conditions not measurable in the specific and general components 
the unallocated allowance as of december  was million  and was million at december  the unallocated allowance is intended to capture risks which are difficult to quantify using the formula based loss components that determine allocations in merchants analysis 
these risks include general economic and business conditions affecting merchants key lending areas  such as changes in interest rates and collateral valuation  credit quality trends  loan volumes and concentrations and specific industry conditions within portfolio segments 
additionally  general reserve factors used to calculate the reserve are based on historical charge off experience and are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of principal is doubtful 
to the extent management determines the level of anticipated losses in the portfolio has significantly increased or diminished  the allowance is adjusted through current earnings 
overall  management believes that the allowance is maintained at an adequate level  in light of historical and current factors  to reflect the level of credit risk in the loan portfolio 
loan loss experience and nonperforming asset data are presented and discussed in relation to their impact on the adequacy of the allowance 
the following table reflects merchants loan loss experience and activity in the allowance for the past five years 
in thousands average loans outstanding allowance beginning of year charge offs commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate mortgage installment credit cards total charge offs recoveries commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage installment credit cards total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses allowance end of year allowance to total loans net loan charge offs recoveries to average loans as of december   merchants allowance ratios were of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
although the allowance has declined over the past five years both in size and as a percentage of the loan portfolio  management has not added to the allowance for several reasons  most notable is the shift in the composition of the loan portfolio over the last five years  on a percentage basis  from higher risk commercial asset classes to less risky residential categories  as shown in the table on page additionally  merchants portfolio of non performing assets has remained at consistently low levels over the last five years  and was 
of total loans at december   the ratio of the allowance to non performing assets at year end was 
merchants will continue to take all appropriate measures to restore nonperforming assets to performing status or otherwise liquidate these assets in an orderly fashion so as to maximize their value to merchants 
there can be no assurances that merchants will be able to complete the disposition of nonperforming assets without incurring further losses 
related party transactions merchants engages in banking transactions with certain of its directors and officers  and certain of their affiliates 
during merchants obtained legal services from a firm associated with one of its directors totaling thousand  and project management services from a firm associated with one of its directors totaling thousand 
merchants obtained insurance during through an insurance agency agency of which a director of merchants bank is president 
in  premiums paid to the agency totaled thousand 
merchants obtains these services on terms that are comparable to those that it would obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
at december   merchants had loans outstanding to directors  executive officers  and associates of such persons totaling million 
it is the policy of merchants to make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable lending transactions with other persons 
as of december   all loans to directors  officers  and certain of their affiliates  were performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
effects of inflation the financial nature of merchants consolidated balance sheet and statement of income is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  but inflation does affect merchants because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total company assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on merchants financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued revised statement no 
fas r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
the accounting provisions of fas r became effective for public companies for years beginning after july  merchants adopted the provisions of fas r using a modified prospective application 
under the modified prospective application  fas r  which provides certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation among other changes  will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under fas all options outstanding are fully ves ted as of december  therefore adoption of fas r will have no impact 
future grants will be accounted for according to the provisions of fas r 
liquidity and capital resource management general liquidity  as it pertains to banking  can be defined as the ability to meet cash commitments at all times in the most economical way to satisfy loan and deposit withdrawal demand  and to meet other business opportunities that require cash 
sources of liquidity for banks include short term liquid assets  cash generated from loan repayments and amortization  borrowing  deposit generation and earnings 
merchants has a number of sources of liquid funds  including million in available federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks at year end  an overnight line of credit with the fhlb of million  an estimated additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of million  and the ability to borrow through the use of repurchase agreements  collateralized by merchants investments  with certain approved counterparties 
merchants investment portfolio  which totaled million at december   is actively managed by the merchants asset liability committee alc o and is a strong source of cash flow for merchants 
the portfolio is fairly liquid  with a weighted average life of approximately years  and is available to be used as a source of funds  if needed 
contractual obligations merchants has certain long term contractual obligations  including long term debt agreements  operating leases for branch operations  and time deposits 
the maturity schedules for these obligations are as follows one year three less than to three years to over five in thousands one year years five years years total debt maturities junior subordinated debentures operating lease payments time deposits commitments and off balance sheet risk merchants is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
such instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
merchants uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the contractual amounts of these financial instruments at december   are as follows in thousands contractual amount financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to originate loans unused lines of credit standby letters of credit equity commitments to affordable housing limited partnerships commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to originate loans generally have expiration dates within days of the commitment 
unused lines of credit have expiration dates ranging from one to two years from the date of the commitment 
since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement 
merchants evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
upon extension of credit merchants obtains an appropriate amount of real and or personal property as collateral based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and  and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 requires certain disclosures and liability recognition for the fair value at issuance of guarantees that fall within its scope 
under fin no 
 merchants does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure  other than its standby letters of credit 
merchants has issued conditional commitments in the form of standby letters of credit to guarantee payment on behalf of a customer and guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
standby letters of credit generally arise in connection with lending relationships 
the credit risk involved in issuing these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
contingent obligations under s tandby letters of credit totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively and represent the maximum potential future payments merchants could be required to make 
typically  these instruments have terms of months or less and expire unused  therefore  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
each customer is evaluated individually for creditworthiness under the same underwriting standards used for commitments to extend credit and on balance sheet instruments 
merchants policies governing loan collateral apply to standby letters of credit at the time of credit extension 
loan to value ratios are generally consistent with loan to value requirements for other commercial loans secured by similar types of collateral 
the fair value of merchants standby letters of credit at december  and was insignificant 
equity commitments to affordable housing partnerships represent funding commitments by merchants to certain limited partnerships 
these partnerships were created for the purpose of acquiring  constructing and or redeveloping affordable housing projects 
the funding of these commitments is generally contingent upon substantial completion of the project and none extend beyond the fifth anniversary of substantial completion 
capital resources in general  capital growth is essential to support deposit and asset growth and to ensure the strength and safety of merchants 
net income increased merchants capital by million in  million in and million in payment of dividends decreased merchants capital by million  million and million during  and  respectively 
merchants declared a special dividend of per share on december  the total amount of the special dividend was million  which is included in the million discussed above 
merchants board of directors determined that the lower tax rates on dividends provided an opportunity for merchants to return capital to its shareholders in the form of a special dividend in a simple  fair and transparent process 
in december merchants  through a newly formed subsidiary business trust  privately placed million in capital securities as part of pooled trust preferred program 
these capi tal securities have certain features that make them an attractive funding vehicle 
the securities qualify as regulatory capital under regulatory adequacy guidelines  and are included in capital in the table below 
merchants remained well capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines after the payment of the special dividend both with and without the trust preferred securities 
stock repurchases decreased merchants capital by million during  there were no stock repurchases during in addition changes in the market value of merchants available for sale investment portfolio decreased capital by million in merchants pension plan was under funded by million at december  which resulted in an after tax charge of million to equity for a minimum pension liability adjustment at december  the tax effected adjustment was a thousand increase in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  merchants is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulatory agencies 
to be considered adequately capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  merchants must maintain minimum levels of tier leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital 
merchants was considered well capitalized by the regulators at december  the ratios for merchants are set forth below actual in thousands amount percentage tier leverage capital tier risk based capital total risk based capital capital amounts include million in trust preferred securities issued in december these hybrid securities qualify as regulatory capital up to certain regulatory limits 
in january merchants board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
the program has been extended until january under the program  merchants is authorized to repurchase up to thousand shares of its common stock 
as of december   merchants had purchased thousand shares of its common stock on the open market under the program at an average per share price of 
in october of merchants board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program  pursuant to which merchants may repurchase thousand shares of its stock from time to time through october the new program commenced when there were no shares remaining under the previous stock repurchase program 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management general management and the board of directors of merchants are committed to sound risk management practices throughout the organization 
merchants has developed and implemented a centralized risk management monitoring program 
risks associated with merchants business activities and products are identified and measured as to probability of occurrence and impact on merchants low  moderate  or high  and the control or other activities in place to manage those risks are identified and assessed 
periodically  department level and senior managers re evaluate and report on the risk management processes for which they are responsible 
this documented program provides management with a comprehensive framework for monitoring merchants risk profile from a macro perspective  it also serves as a tool for assessing internal controls over financial reporting as required under the fdicia and the sarbanes oxley act of market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
merchants primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
an important component of merchants asset and liability management process is the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk  which is governed by established policies that are reviewed and approved annually by merchants board of directors 
the investment policy details the types of securities that may be purchased  and establishes portfolio limits and maturity limits for the various sectors 
the investment policy also establishes specific investment quality limits 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the alco 
in this capacity the alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting merchants asset and liability management related activ ities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
the alco manages the investment portfolio 
as the portfolio has grown  the alco has used portfolio diversification as a way to mitigate the risk of being too heavily invested in any single asset class 
merchants continued to work to maximize net interest income while mitigating risk during through further repositioning of the investment portfolio  as well as carefully monitoring the overall duration and average life of the portfolio  as well as monitoring individual securities  among other strategies 
merchants has an outside investment advisory firm which helps it identify opportunities for increased yield  without significantly increasing risk  in the investment portfolio 
the firm specializes in stable value and fixed income portfolios  and has a staff of investment professionals who research and track each bond 
the alco has a weekly conference call with the investment advisor 
durin g these calls the alco and the investment advisor discuss trading activity from the previous week  and set strategy for the ensuing week 
additionally  any specific bonds or sectors that require additional attention are discussed on these calls 
the investment advisory firm meets with the alco committee of merchants board of directors to perform a portfolio review on a quarterly basis 
they report on the overall performance of the portfolio and perform modeling of the cash flow  effective duration  and yield characteristics of the portfolio under various interest rate scenarios 
the investment advisors also review and provide detail on individual holdings in the portfolio 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to a movement in interest rates  which  as described above  affects the company s net interest income 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of members of senior management  meets frequently to review and develop asset liability management strategies and tactics 
the alco is responsible for evaluating and managing the interest rate risk which arises naturally from imbalances in repricing  maturity and cash flow characteristics of merchants assets and liabilities 
techniques used by the alco take into consideration the cash flow and repricing attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet items and their relation to possible changes in interest rates 
the alco manages interest rate exposure primarily by using on balance sheet strategies  generally accomplished through the management of the duration  rate sensitivity and average lives of the company s various investments  and by extending or shortening maturities of borrowed funds  as well as carefully managing and monitoring the pricing of loans and deposits 
the alco also considers the use of off balance sheet strategies  such as interest rate caps and floors and interest rate swaps  to help minimize the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco uses an outside inve stment advisor to recommend investments and assist in transaction execution  and an outside alco consultant to perform rate shocks of its balance sheet and a variety of other analyses for the committee 
the alco is responsible for ensuring that the board of directors receives accurate information regarding merchants interest rate risk position at least quarterly 
the investment advisor and alco consultant meet jointly with the alco and the asset liability committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis to review the bank s current position and to discuss future strategies 
this review shows that merchants one year gap position has changed to a million liability sensitive position  compared to a million liability sensitive position at the end of this change is primarily a result of the migration of commercial and commercial real estate loans from variable rate to fixed rate as short term rates have moved up 
merchants has established a target range for the change in net interest income  given a parallel basis point change in interest rates  of zero to 
the net interest income simulation as of december st showed that the change in net interest income for the next months from merchants expected or most likely forecast was as follows percent change in rate change net interest income up basis points down basis points the analysis shows additional margin compression in both the up and down basis points scenarios 
the ability to reduce funding costs is limited in the falling rate environment  while the approximately million base of variable rate prime based loans rapidly reset to lower yields 
if rates fall further it will be difficult for merchants to lower deposit rates enough to compensate for these anticipated decreases in loan rates 
a steepening yield curve accompanied by rapidly falling short term rates would create less exposure as compared to a parallel rate shift 
in a rising rate scenario  net interest income trends slightly downward during most of the first two years as funding costs initially increase more quickly than asset yields 
the model shows that after deposit costs begin to stabilize  margins begin to widen and net interest income increases 
the degree to which this exposure materializes will depend  in part  on merchants ability to manage deposit and loan rate s as interest rates rise or fall 
the analysis discussed above includes no growth assumptions 
the consultant also ran additional simulations  and modeled a down basis points scenario with a steepening yield curve  a basis point upward movement in rates and a simulation using merchants current growth assumptions 
the steepening yield curve scenario mitigated some of the margin compression in the down basis points scenario 
net interest income was higher than base in all scenarios in the growth model  demonstrating that merchants can outgrow the potential margin compression 
these types of dynamic analyses give the alco a more thorough understanding of how merchants balance sheet will perform in a variety of rate environments 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent merchants forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including without limitation the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit run off rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  among others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  merchants cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
the most significant factors affecting market risk exposure of net interest income during the year ended december  were i the shape and level of the us government securities and interest rate swap yield curve  ii changes in the size and composition of the investment portfolio  iii changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio  and iv increases in deposit interest expense 
during the yield curve flattened significantly as the federal funds rate increased approximately basis points while rates on ten year treasuries increased by only basis points 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will likely differ due to the varying impact of changes in the balances and mix of loans and deposits differing from those assumed  the impact of possible off balance sheet hedging strategies  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect all actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
the model used to perform the balance sheet simulation assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve over twelve months and reprices every interest bearing asset and liability on merchants balance sheet 
the model uses contractual repricing dates for variable products  contractual maturities for fixed rate products  and product specific assumptions for deposits such as free checking for life accounts and money market accounts which are subject to repricing based on current market conditions 
investment securities with call provisions are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of a call 
the model also assumes that the rate at which certain mortgage related assets prepay will vary as rates rise and fall  based on prepayment estimates derived from the office of thrift supervision net portfolio value model 
merchants interest rate sensitivity gap gap is pictured below as of december  interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and repricing characteristics of merchants on and off balance sheet positions 
gap is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified periods 
an asset sensitive position positive gap indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within a specified time period  which would imply a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position negative gap generally implies a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
there are certain limitations inherent in a static gap analysis 
these limitations include the fact that it is a static measurement and that it does not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and interest bearing deposits may respond non proportionally to changes in market interest rates 
although the alco reviews all assumptions used in the model in detail  assets and liabilities do not always have clear repricing dates  and may reprice earlier or later than assumed in the model 
repricing date one day over six one year to six months to to five over five in thousands months one year years years total assets loans us treasury agency securities mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations other securities other assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits short term borrowings other liabilities long term debt shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity cumulative gap gap as a of total earning assets based on historical experience and merchants internal repricing policies  it is merchants practice to present repricing of statement savings  savings deposits  free checking for life r and now account balances in the one year to five years category 
merchants experience has shown that the rates on these deposits tend to be less rate sensitive than other types of deposits 
credit risk the board of directors reviews and approves merchants loan policy on an annual basis 
among other things  the loan policy establishes restrictions regarding the types of loans that may be granted  and the distribution of loan types within merchants portfolio 
merchants board of directors grants each loan officer the authority to originate loans on behalf of merchants  subject to certain limitations 
these authorized lending limits are reviewed at least annually and are based upon the lender s knowledge and experience 
loan requests that exceed a lender s authority require the signature of merchants credit division manager  senior loan officer  and or president 
all extensions of credit of million or greater to any one borrower or related party interest  are reviewed and approved by the loan committee of merchants board of directors 
merchants loan portfolio is continuously monitored for performance  creditworthiness and strength of documentation through the use of a variety of management reports and with the assistance of an external loan review firm 
credit ratings are assigned to commercial loans and are routinely reviewed 
loan officers or the loan workout function take remedial actions to assure full and timely payment of loan balances when necessary 
merchants policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans when scheduled payments become contractually past due or more days and the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful
