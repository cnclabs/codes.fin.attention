item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research and development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer 
immunotherapies are treatments that utilize the immune system to combat diseases 
our lead product candidate  myvax personalized immunotherapy  is a patient specific active immunotherapy that is based on the unique genetic makeup of a patient s tumor and is designed to activate a patient s immune system to identify and attack cancer cells 
myvax is currently in a pivotal phase clinical trial and additional phase clinical trials for the treatment of b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma  or b cell nhl 
b cells  also called b lymphocytes  are one of the two major classes of lymphocytes  which are types of white blood cells 
in the united states  b cell nhl represents approximately to of diagnosed cases of lymphoma 
in the united states  approximately  patients are newly diagnosed with nhl each year  and there are over  existing patients currently diagnosed with nhl 
nhl is clinically classified as either slow growing  referred to as indolent  or fast growing  referred to as aggressive 
there are approximately  patients diagnosed with indolent b cell nhl in the united states each year 
our pivotal phase clinical trial is designed for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl  which represents approximately half of the cases of indolent b cell nhl 
results from our completed and interim results from our ongoing phase clinical trials of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl indicate that myvax is generally safe and well tolerated 
we believe that patient specific active immunotherapies can also be applied successfully to the treatment of other cancers 
as a result  we recently initiated a phase clinical trial in february to evaluate myvax for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll 
in november  based on positive interim phase clinical trial results from our trial  we initiated a pivotal  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trial  our trial  to assess the safety and efficacy of myvax in treating patients with previously untreated follicular b cell nhl 
we have completed treatment of all 
table of contents patients in this trial 
on july   our independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  met and reviewed the first planned interim analysis of blinded data for safety and efficacy in our pivotal phase clinical trial and recommended the trial continue as planned 
we currently anticipate that the next planned interim analysis of data for efficacy will be scheduled to occur in mid  with the detailed follow up period of the clinical trial scheduled to conclude in approximately the fourth quarter of we believe that  if successful  the results of our phase clinical trial will support our application for regulatory approval of myvax for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 
the total research and development costs associated with and incurred for the development of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
from inception through december   the total research and development costs associated with and incurred for the development of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl were approximately million 
we are also developing a panel of monoclonal antibodies that we believe potentially represents an additional novel  personalized approach for treating nhl 
we recently filed patent applications for the composition and therapeutic use of this panel 
the monoclonal antibodies could eventually be used alone or in synergistic combination with myvax and might reduce or eliminate the need for chemotherapy in the early treatment of nhl 
we intend to file an investigational new drug  or ind  application in and initiate clinical trials thereafter 
in may  we entered into two agreements the lease agreements to lease an aggregate of approximately  square feet of space located in two buildings at the ardenwood technology park in fremont  california for our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
the initial term of each of the leases is years  terminating in november the lease agreements include two five year options to extend the terms of the leases 
in addition  we have a three year option to lease additional space on adjacent property 
simultaneously with the execution of the lease agreements  we also entered into two construction agreements to provide for the build out of the two building facility 
the current estimated cost of the build out is approximately million 
as part of the construction agreements  the landlord has provided a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million to be applied towards the construction of the two buildings  which began during the fourth quarter of we have not generated any revenues to date  and we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of common and preferred stock  our lines of credit  public offerings of common stock and interest income earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including million  which is restricted as to its use 
in september  we filed with the sec  and in october  the sec declared effective  a shelf registration statement on form s covering the offer and sale  from time to time  of shares of our common stock in one or more offerings up to a total offering price of million at prices and on terms determined by market conditions at the time of any offering made under the shelf registration statement 
in february  we completed an underwritten public offering under this shelf registration statement in which we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriters commission and estimated offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we anticipate working on a number of long term development projects that will involve experimental and unproven technology 
the projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will need significant additional operating funds to continue our research and development activities and clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals  and if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained  to build sales and marketing capabilities and potentially expand production capabilities  as necessary 
we cannot predict when we may begin to realize product revenue 
until we are able to generate sufficient product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash 
table of contents balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  myvax  or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and any additional debt financing  if available  may require that we pledge our assets  including our intellectual property  or involve restrictive covenants that would limit our business activities 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing or cost of the efforts necessary to complete the development of myvax nor can we predict with precision when these development efforts will be completed 
we cannot reasonably predict when we may have material net cash inflows from sales of myvax  if ever 
these uncertainties result from the numerous risks associated with developing myvax  including the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the second interim analysis of our pivotal phase clinical trial  the uncertainty of results of our ongoing pivotal phase clinical trial for myvax  the uncertainty of obtaining regulatory approval for myvax  including regulatory approval for our manufacturing facility and process  the uncertainty related to completion of the build out  equipping and qualification of our new manufacturing facility  our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of myvax at acceptable cost levels  and our ability to successfully market and sell myvax 
if we fail to complete the development of myvax in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are set forth in the risk factors entitled we will need significant additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts  we currently have no source of revenue and may never become profitable  if clinical trials of myvax  or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  do not produce successful clinical trial results  we will be unable to commercialize these products and our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize myvax for indications other than follicular b cell nhl are at an early stage and are subject to a high risk of failure  as well as other risk factors 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical development  apply for regulatory approvals  build out  equip and qualify a manufacturing facility for the manufacture of myvax  and seek to develop active immunotherapies for the treatment of cll and potentially other forms of cancer  to establish sales and marketing and distribution capabilities and otherwise to expand our operations 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements clinical trial accruals 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the ongoing development of myvax 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
we accrue for the costs of clinical studies conducted by contract research organizations  or cros  based on estimated costs over the life of the individual study 
further  we monitor patient registration levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates on a monthly basis 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from cros to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
our estimates and assumptions may not match the timing of actual services performed by the organizations  which may result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
marketable securities 
we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income and other income  net 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our interest income and other income  net 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income and other income  net 
stock based compensation 
we have a stock option plan to reward and provide incentives to our employees  which is described more fully in note to the financial statements 
we account for this plan under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and related interpretations and apply the disclosure provisions of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
we amortize stock based compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 using an accelerated amortization model 
for financial reporting purposes  we have recorded stock based compensation representing the difference between the fair value of common stock and the option exercise price 
prior to the closing of our initial public offering  we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including significant clinical milestones attained  sales of our convertible preferred stock  changes in valuations of existing comparable publicly traded biotechnology companies  trends in the broad market for biotechnology stocks and the expected valuation we would obtain in our initial public offering 
subsequent to the offering  we determined the fair value of our common stock based on quoted market prices 
all stock options granted subsequent to the offering were granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value 
though we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million for stock options granted to employees during the year ended december   there was no deferred stock based compensation recorded for the years ended december  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
outstanding stock based deferred compensation is expense decreased in the period of forfeiture for any accrued but unvested compensation arising from the early termination of an option holder s services 
we disclose in note to the financial statements the pro forma impact of applying the provisions of sfas  as amended  to our stock awards 
prior to the closing of our initial public offering  the fair value of options issued 
table of contents pursuant to our option plan at the grant date were estimated using the minimum value method 
following the offering  the value of each option has been estimated using the black scholes model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net loss and net loss per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share in the future as the number of shares to be issued under the plan including any future plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
additionally  as described more fully in note to the financial statements  we have issued stock options to non employees  generally for services  which we account for under the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force eitf no 
these options are also valued using the black scholes model 
for stock options issued to non employees  we amortized million of stock compensation expense for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  there was no amortization 
as discussed immediately below  beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we will be required to comply with sfas r  which is expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas r 
the new pronouncement replaces the existing requirements under sfas and apb according to sfas r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  would be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
this pronouncement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using apb and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options  however  we are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than would result from the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that would result in different accounting treatment than is currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan  and the presentation of these tax benefits within the statement of cash flows 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides guidance on the initial implementation of sfas r 
in particular  the statement includes guidance related to share based payment awards for non employees  valuation methods and selecting underlying assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term 
sab also gives guidance on the classification of compensation expense associated with such awards and accounting for the income tax effects of those awards upon the adoption of sfas r 
we are currently assessing the guidance provided in sab in connection with the implementation of sfas r 
in april  the sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the effective date of sfas r 
the effective date of the new standard under these new rules for our financial statements is january  adoption of this statement is expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp rather than disclose the impact on our net loss within our footnotes  as is our current practice 
the full impact of sfas r on our financial statements and related disclosures is still being evaluated by management but is expected to be material to our results of operations 
our actual share based compensation expense in will be 
table of contents dependent on a number of factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless impracticable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations research and development expenses year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages staffing related clinical trial and manufacturing material costs amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total research and development expenses research and development expenses represented approximately  and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities and clinical trial preparations  preclinical and clinical trial expenses  including costs related to registration  treatment and monitoring expenses  costs related to regulatory matters and the costs related to the development of our manufacturing process 
the increase in research and development expenses for as compared to was a result of higher staffing levels  of which approximately million was related to the hiring of process sciences  research and manufacturing executives and related personnel during in addition  we recognized higher facilities and other costs of approximately million in  associated with the lease agreements for the new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
these increases were offset partially by decreased costs related to manufacturing materials and external testing of approximately million  resulting from the completion of patient registration in the second quarter of for our pivotal phase clinical trial and a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million resulting from the continued vesting of these previously granted options the increase in from was due primarily to higher staffing levels and recruiting costs  of which million was related to the addition of manufacturing and quality assurance and control personnel 
in addition  clinical trial costs associated with our lead product  myvax  and costs related to manufacturing materials and external testing  increased by million 
this increase was offset partially by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of million resulting from the continued vesting of these previously granted options 
we expect to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we continue our development of myvax and expect our research and development expenditures to increase during and subsequent years 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our product candidates 
in addition  the development of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of further development and approval of our products 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages staffing related product advocacy costs amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and outside marketing activities related to product support and awareness 
these expenses increased for as compared to  primarily due to increased staffing costs of approximately million related to the hiring of additional staff 
facilities and other costs increased by million primarily due to increased rent expense associated with our new facilities 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in from was primarily due to increased product advocacy costs related to clinical trial support and awareness and initiation of commercialization planning projects for myvax 
we expect sales and marketing spending to increase in and subsequent years as we prepare for the possible commercialization of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages staffing related legal  professional fees and insurance amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of administrative personnel and related costs to support our organizational growth  as well as legal  accounting and other professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to  due primarily to higher payroll related costs  legal and professional fees and corporate insurance costs totaling approximately million required to support the organizational growth of the company  and million of increased rent expense associated with our new facilities 
the increase in from was due to additional administrative expenses of approximately million related to higher staffing costs  legal and professional fees and corporate insurance costs to support the organizational growth  and responsibilities of being a public company 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from the continued vesting of these previously granted options 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase during as a result of additional administrative and infrastructure costs associated with our organizational growth including costs associated with ongoing compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and potential implementation of new finance and accounting systems 

table of contents loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of series e convertible preferred stock warrants year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages loss on extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of series e convertible preferred stock warrants we recorded a million loss related to the extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of convertible preferred stock warrants for the year ended december  no such charge was recorded during or interest expense year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded interest expense of million related to the amortization of the discount on our convertible notes  million related to the amortization of the warrant issued in connection with our lines of credit and million related to the stated interest on the convertible notes 
no such charges were recorded during and interest and other income  net year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages interest and other income  net the increase in interest and other income  net  in as compared to was due to interest received on higher average cash balances as a result of proceeds received from our follow on offering in june and our private placement in december  as well as higher interest rates during the increase in from was due to interest on higher average cash balances as a result of the cash proceeds received from our completed initial public offering in november and our completed follow on public offering in june dividend related to issuance of convertible preferred shares and the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages dividend related to issuance of convertible preferred shares and beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock we recorded a non cash dividend of million related to the issuance of convertible preferred shares and the beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock for the year ended december  no such charge was recorded for the years ended december  or

as we proceed with the build out and the payment of the construction costs  these collateralized assets will decrease in proportion to the payments made 
in addition  we have a million certificate of deposit that serves as collateral for two other letters of credit related to the lease of our new facilities 
both the investment account and the certificate of deposit have been classified as restricted cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet

we have incurred significant losses since our inception in and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our accumulated deficit resulted principally from our research and development activities associated with myvax  including our pivotal phase clinical trial and additional phase clinical trials  and several non cash charges associated with our preferred stock financings 
included in our accumulated deficit is a non cash dividend of approximately million related to our preferred stock financings in april and may also  our accumulated deficit includes a non cash charge of approximately million associated with the extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of the related warrants issued to preferred stockholders in august and approximately million of non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount on the convertible notes 
additionally  there was non cash interest expense of approximately million associated with the amortization of the warrant issued to the guarantor of our lines of credit 
through december   we had amortized and expensed non cash stock based compensation of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increased use of cash in operations for compared to was primarily due to our continued research and development activities associated with myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl and higher cash usage for prepaids and other assets  primarily related to million of prepaid rent and million of new facility construction costs paid by the company that have not yet been reimbursed by the landlord 
these increased uses of cash were offset in part by a million increase in accounts payable attributable to the timing of vendor payments and a million increase in deferred rent attributable to rent holidays and scheduled rent increases related to the new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
the change in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily due to our research and development activities associated with myvax and higher cash usage for prepaids and other assets and accounts payable  due to the timing of payments made  offset partially by an increase in accrued liabilities

the current estimated cost of the build out is approximately million 
as part of the construction agreements  the landlord has provided a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million to be applied towards the construction of the two buildings  which began during the fourth quarter of cash used in investing activities during also included a million cash security deposit paid to the landlord of our new facility 
in the future  net cash provided by or used in investing activities may fluctuate from period to period due to timing of payments for capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of our marketable securities

table of contents as of december   we had contractual obligations related to operating and capital leases as follows in thousands payments due by period less than beyond total year years years years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations related to new building lease agreements non cancelable operating lease obligations related to other facilities capital lease obligations total contractual obligations in may  we entered into two lease agreements to lease an aggregate of approximately  square feet of space located in two buildings at the ardenwood technology park in fremont  california for our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
the term of each of the leases is years and each lease will terminate in november the lease agreements include two five year options to extend the terms of the leases 
in addition  we have a three year option to lease additional space on adjacent property 
in december  we entered into a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement the reimbursement agreement and related security agreement security agreement with a commercial bank that provides for the issuance of four letters of credit  described below as the rent letters of credit and the construction letters of credit 
these letters of credit were provided to secure certain rental and construction obligations under the lease and construction agreements for our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
contemporaneously with the execution of the lease agreements  we also entered into two construction agreements to provide for the build out of the two building campus 
as part of the construction agreements  the landlord will provide us a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million to be applied towards the construction of the two buildings 
prior to the commencement of construction  we were required to provide an irrevocable unconditional letter of credit equal to the difference between the total estimated construction costs and the improvement allowance  which difference is estimated to be up to approximately million 
in december  two letters of credit were provided to the landlord in the aggregate amount of million the construction letters of credit that were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the reimbursement agreement 
the construction letters of credit will expire on may  pursuant to the terms of the security agreement  the construction letters of credit are being collateralized by cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in a genitope bank investment account totaling approximately million that has been recorded as restricted cash 
as we proceed with the build out and the payment of the construction costs  the collateralized assets and restricted cash will decrease in proportion to the payments made 
the lease agreements provided for rent holidays for the first five and one half months and an initial monthly basic rent of per square foot  with scheduled annual rent increases of over the lease term 
the company is responsible for approximately of the construction costs for the tenant improvements and  under eitf no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  is deemed  for accounting purposes only  to be the accounting owner of the project and the building shells  even though it is not the legal owner 
upon the commencement of the leases in may  the company capitalized the estimated fair value of the building shells of million  which has been recorded as construction in progress 
the related liability has been recorded as a lease financing liability on the accompanying balance sheet 
in accordance with eitf  the portion of the leases related to ground rent will be treated as an operating lease expense 
as a result of being considered the owner for accounting purposes  build out costs reimbursed by the landlord will increase the lease financing liability 
build out costs paid by the company will be capitalized consistent with the company s standard policy 
upon completion of construction  the leases  if restructured  could qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
if this treatment is available  the lease financing liability 
table of contents and associated construction in progress and capitalized building costs will be removed from the company s balance sheet and the difference reclassified as either prepaid or deferred rent to be amortized over the lease term as rent expense 
if the leases do not qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 the lease financing liability will be amortized over the lease term based upon the payments designated in the agreement  and the building and improvement assets will be depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
the lease agreements required us to provide a million security deposit  of which million was in the form of cash and million was in the form of a letter of credit 
in september  we paid a cash security deposit to the landlord of million and as of december   we have provided two letters of credit to the landlord in the aggregate amount of million the rent letters of credit 
the rent letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the reimbursement agreement and will expire on january  pursuant to the terms of the security agreement  the rent letters of credit are collateralized in the same amount by a certificate of deposit held in a genitope bank account and recorded as restricted cash see note of notes to financial statements 
the reimbursement agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and other restrictions

if an event of default occurs and is continuing  the bank may cause all amounts outstanding under the reimbursement agreement at that time to become immediately due and payable 
our long term commitments under operating leases related to our other facilities consist of payments relating to four real estate leases and subleases covering  square feet  located in redwood city and foster city  california 
these leases and subleases expire between july and november on march   we entered into a sublease with argonaut technologies  inc to lease  for approximately months  an additional  square feet of laboratory and office space adjacent to our current corporate headquarters in redwood city  california 
the aggregate lease payments amount to approximately  we anticipate working on a number of long term development projects which will involve experimental and unproven technology 
these projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will need significant additional operating funds to continue our research and development activities and clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals and  if regulatory approval of any product candidate is obtained  to build sales and marketing capabilities and potentially expand production capabilities  as necessary 
we believe that our current cash resources  including net proceeds received in the february offering  together with the interest thereon  will provide us with sufficient financial resources to support our operating plan for the next months or more 
our estimate of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors  including the risk factors discussed in this report 
we have based this estimate on current assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we expect that our cash consumption will increase in as we anticipate an increase in operating expenses related to the growth of the company  as well as the build out of our manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters and the purchase of related manufacturing and laboratory equipment 
we will need to raise significant additional funds to commercialize myvax if myvax receives regulatory approval for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 
our manufacturing facility must be built and qualified and pass a pre approval inspection from the appropriate regulatory agency prior to any regulatory approval for myvax 
during the second quarter of  we began incurring costs for our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters and have incurred approximately million through december  related to pre construction and design activities  excluding the non cash impact of eitf we estimate that the total cost of the facility  before giving effect to the million tenant improvement allowance  including related manufacturing and laboratory equipment  could exceed million  excluding the non cash impact of eitf 
table of contents we cannot predict when we may begin to realize product revenue 
until we can generate sufficient product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration or licensing arrangements or other arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  myvax or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and any additional debt financing  if available  may require that we pledge our assets  including our intellectual property  or involve restrictive covenants that would limit our business activities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over yield considerations 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  including restricted cash of million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the total fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would not be material 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states
