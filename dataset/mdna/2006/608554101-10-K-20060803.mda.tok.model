item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our core business is the manufacture and sale of electromechanical components 
our products are used by a large number of leading original equipment manufacturers oems throughout the world 
we design  manufacture and sell more than  products including terminals  connectors  planar cables  cable assemblies  interconnection systems  backplanes  integrated products and mechanical and electronic switches 
we also provide manufacturing services to integrate specific components into a customer s product 
our connectors  interconnecting devices and assemblies are used principally in the telecommunications  data  consumer products  automotive and industrial markets 
our products are used in a wide range of applications including desktop and notebook computers  computer peripheral equipment  mobile phones  digital electronics such as cameras and plasma televisions  automobile engine control units and adaptive braking systems  factory robotics and diagnostic equipment 
we believe that our sales mix is balanced  with growth prospects in a number of markets 
net revenues by market can fluctuate based on various factors including new technologies within the industry  composition of customers and new products or model changes that we or our customers introduce 
the approximate percentage of net revenue by market for fiscal  and is outlined below 
of net revenue telecommunications data products automotive consumer industrial other total we sell our products directly to oems and to their subcontractors and suppliers and  to a lesser extent  through distributors throughout the world 
our engineers work collaboratively with customers to develop products that meet their specific needs 
our connector products are designed to help manufacturers assemble their own products more efficiently 
our electronic components help enable manufacturers to break down their production into sub assemblies that can be built on different production lines  in different factories or by subcontractors 
our connectors allow these sub assemblies to be readily plugged together before selling the end product to a customer 
our connectors also enable users to connect together related electronic items  such as mobile phones to battery chargers and computers to printers 
many of our customers are multi national corporations that manufacture their products in multiple operations in several countries 
we service our customers through our global manufacturing footprint 
as of june   we operated manufacturing plants  located in countries on five continents 
manufacturing in many sectors has continued to move from the united states and western europe to lower cost regions 
in addition  reduced trade barriers  lower freight cost and improved supply chain logistics have reduced the need for duplicate regional manufacturing capabilities 
for these reasons  our strategy has been to consolidate multiple plants of modest size in favor of operating fewer  larger and more integrated facilities in strategic locations around the world 
as announced in april  we realigned part of our manufacturing capacity that resulted in the closing of seven plants in five countries 
we operate our business in four geograph ic regions 
in  of our revenue was derived from sales in asia 
economic growth in asia  particularly in china  is anticipated to be greater than in the americas and europe 
our management believes that it has positioned the business to benefit from this trend 
approximately of our manufacturing capacity is in lower cost areas such as china  eastern europe and mexico 
the market in which we operate is highly fragmented with a limited number of large companies and a significant number of smaller companies making electronic connectors 
we are the world s second largest manufacturer of electronic connectors 
we believe that our global presence and our ability to design and manufacture our products throughout the world and to service our customers globally is a key advantage for us 
our growth has come primarily from new products that we develop  often in collaboration with our customers 
financial highlights net revenue for fiscal of billion increased over fiscal net revenue of billion 
net revenue in local currencies increased 
net income for the year of million increased million from million reported in the prior year 
fiscal includes restructuring costs of million million after tax 
fiscal net income included a restructuring charge of million million after tax  a goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax and an asset impairment charge of million million after tax 
as announced on april   we realigned part of our manufacturing capacity in order to reduce costs and better optimize plant utilization and to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded an additional pre tax charge of million during fiscal in connection with this plan 
cash expenditures through june  in connection with the restructuring were million  consisting primarily of severance and other employee related costs 
implementation of this restructuring program began in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal we believe that the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of june  the fiscal results include the effect of expensing stock options according to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment 
selling  general and administrative expense was million higher in fiscal as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
on june   we signed a definitive merger agreement with woodhead industries  inc woodhead pursuant to which we agreed to acquire woodhead in an all cash transaction valued at approximately million  including payments with respect to outstanding stock options and the assumption of debt and net of cash acquired 
the boards of directors of both companies approved the transaction 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we commenced on july   a tender offer for all outstanding shares of woodhead stock at a price of per share in cash 
we plan to acquire shares not purchased pursuant to the tender offer  other than dissenting shares  in a subsequent merger at a price of per share in cash as soon as practicable after completion of the tender offer 
completion of the tender offer is currently anticipated during the fiscal quarter ending september   and is subject to certain conditions  including the tender by woodhead stockholders of a majority of woodhead s common shares on a fully diluted basis  receipt of regulatory approvals  and other customary conditions 
there is no guarantee that we will acquire sufficient woodhead shares to complete the acquisition 
critical accounting estimates our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates communicated below with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
noted here are a number of policies that require significant judgments or estimates 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition  as issued by the sec and other applicable guidance 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer 
contracts and customer purchase orders generally are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents  proof of delivery and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether an amount due from a customer is fixed and determinable based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  including  but not limited to  the payment terms associated with the transaction 
the impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal 
a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
we have net deferred tax assets of million at june  we have operations in countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries 
the estimation of the income tax amounts that we record involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations  evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes 
although our management believes our tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
we periodically assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets based upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is established in the period such determination is made 
we have determined that it is unlikely that we will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non us net operating losses 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded in fiscal to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of million related to certain european net operating losses 
the cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately million at june  it is our policy to establish accruals for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of examinations by tax authorities 
we establish the accruals based upon management s assessment of probable income tax contingencies 
at june   we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable contingencies 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or would be required to pay amounts in excess of accruals  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market value 
fifo inventories recorded in our consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess 
the allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product  open sales orders and future sales forecasts 
if our sales forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative impact on gross margin and operating results 
such factors require judgment  and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance 
pension plans the costs and obligations of our defined benefit pension plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
three critical assumptions used  which impact the net periodic pension expense income and two of which impact the benefit obligation  are the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments 
we have typically used the market rate for aa aa rated corporate bonds for this assumption 
the expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets 
we have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans 
these key assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts 
the effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions for our pension plans as of june   assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses  is shown below in thousands increase decrease increase decrease in pbo in pension expense us plan int l plans us plan int l plans discount rate change increase basis points decrease basis points expected rate of return change increase basis points n a n a decrease basis points n a n a other postretirement benefits we have retiree health care plans that cover the majority of our us employees 
there are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the us the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and retiree health care benefit expense 
a basis point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in thousands effect on total service and interest cost increase basis points decrease basis points effect on apbo increase basis points decrease basis points goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of may st  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we review both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support our assumptions with regard to fair value 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to our carrying value 
reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
components are defined as operations for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment 
the expected future cash flows are based on management s estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including projected economic conditions and customer demand  revenue and margins  changes in competition  operating costs and new products introduced 
in determining fair value  we make certain judgments 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable  changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation 
restructuring costs we have recorded charges in connection with restructuring our business 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value when the liability is incurred 
the main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions and the closure and consolidation of excess facilities 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments  but under certain circumstances may be recognized over a number of accounting periods 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees  future commitments to pay lease charges  net of e stimated future sublease income  and adjustments to the fair value of buildings and equipment to be sold 
charges for the consolidation of excess facilities are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment 
as of june   we had substantially completed the restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill and trade names  including property and equipment  and identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset  changes in historical trends in operating performance  changes in projected operating performance  and significant negative economic trends 
results of operations year ended june  compared with year ended june  year ended change change result as june  favorable favorable of net revenue in thousands unfavorable unfavorable net revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative restructuring costs goodwill and asset impairments income from operations other income  net income before income taxes income taxes minority interest net income net revenue the increase in revenue was derived primarily from unit volume increases with existing customers and existing products and sales of new products 
we estimate that the impact of price erosion reduced revenue by approximately million compared with the prior year 
we sell our products in five primary markets 
a summary follows of the estimated change in revenue from each market during the fiscal years ended june telecommunications data products automotive consumer industrial we operate in one product segment  the manufacture and sale of electronic components  and four regions 
revenue is recognized based on the location of the selling entity 
the following table sets forth information on customer revenue by geographic region for the periods indicated in thousands year ended change change result as june  favorable favorable of net revenue unfavorable unfavorable americas far east north far east south europe corporate and other total the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies  principally the yen and euro  decreased revenue by approximately million for fiscal from the prior year 
the following table shows the effect on the change in net revenue from foreign currency translations to the us dollar in thousands year ended june  local currency net currency translation change americas far east north far east south europe corporate and other net change the change in revenue on a local currency basis is as follows year ended jun  americas far east north far east south europe total we continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
we believe that new products are essential to enable our customers to advance their solutions and their market leadership positions 
additionally  we believe that new products tend to have a higher gross profit as a percentage of revenue  but may be subject to higher price erosion as unit volumes grow  production experience is accumulated and costs decrease 
revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows for the fiscal years ended june americas far east north far east south europe total americas region north and south america revenue in the americas region increased from the prior year period primarily due to stronger demand and new product offerings for electronic connector products  particularly in high performance applications 
we experienced some recovery in the telecommunications market  resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area 
demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of fiscal as compared with the prior year period partially because in the seasonally slow third fiscal quarter was instead relatively consistent with volumes in the second fiscal quarter 
while we believe that year to date sales growth in the americas region was negatively affected by the movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers  we experienced a reduction in this trend during the second half of fiscal however  we believe that this trend positively contributed to year to date sales in other regions of our business  especially in the far east south region 
far east north region japan and korea revenue in local currencies was higher during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to stronger demand in the consumer and telecom markets 
demand in these markets increased steadily during fiscal and was stronger during the second half of fiscal as compared with the prior year even though the second half of the year is generally seasonally lower for the telecommunications and consumer markets 
the region continues to capitalize on its ability to design compact  high performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market 
the region is developing new connectors for third generation g phones  which in japan include such high speed capabilities as video and camera functionality 
we believe that we are well positioned to grow our g technology business as global cell phone makers adopt this technology 
during fiscal  the region operated at a high capacity level with significant resources allocated to support increased demand in the far east south region 
revenue between regions is generally recognized as intercompany revenue  which is excluded from the revenue by region table  above 
far east south region singapore  malaysia  china  thailand  taiwan and india consistent with the migration of business from the americas  europe and far east north regions to the far east south region  customer revenue in the far east south region increased during fiscal from the prior year 
as a result  this region is our largest and fastest growing in terms of revenue 
the revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by strong demand in the mobile phone and consumer products markets 
demand for these products was significantly higher during the second half of as compared with the same period in the prior year primarily because the inventory correction and reduction in demand that occurred in the third fiscal quarter of did not recur in fiscal our sales in china increased by during fiscal compared with the prior year period  due to customer demand supported by increased production capacity 
the drivers of this growth included i overall higher demand in the mobile phone  consumer electronics and automotive markets  ii the trend of american  european and japanese companies moving their design and production to china and iii greater penetration of taiwanese multinational accounts 
european region for fiscal  revenue as compared with the prior year increased primarily due to a slight recovery in demand for general connector products  increased sales of integrated products and additional penetration in the automotive market in which we participate 
however  the overall trend toward movement offshore of original equipment manufacturers and contract manufacturers continued and we believe that this trend contributed to sales in other regions of our business  especially in the far east south region 
customer revenue in the european region began improving during the third fiscal quarter and increased during the second half of fiscal as compared with the prior year period 
the region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to remain in europe 
these include connectors and integrated products for industrial  medical and automotive applications 
gross profit gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in net revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared with the prior year period  was higher primarily due to operating efficiencies gained in the far east south and focus on higher margin products in the americas 
gross profit for fiscal included the impact of corrections of errors that reduced gross profit by million 
see note to the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we estimate that we paid approximately million more for metal alloys primarily copper  gold and plastic resins in fiscal compared with the prior year period 
these increases  along with the impact of price erosion  were partially offset by i an improved sales mix and product pruning  ii selective price increases that became effective during the second fiscal quarter of  iii improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and iv favorable changes in currency exchange rates 
certain products that we manufacture in japan and europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the us dollar 
as a result of a stronger us dollar compared with the yen during the period  exchange rates reduced our cost of sales reported in us dollars without a corresponding effect on net revenue 
we estimate that the impact from currency transactions increased gross profit by approximately million for fiscal compared with the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year  but increased at a rate substantially lower than the rate of revenue growth 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to support the higher levels of business and the additional compensation expense for stock options as described in the following paragraph was offset by cost reductions due to the restructuring activities initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and other cost containment measures  especially in the european region 
effective in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r which resulted in additional compensation expense of approximately million for fiscal total share based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of income was million for fiscal  of which million is included in selling  general and administrative expenses and million is included in restructuring costs 
in fiscal  we recognized million of share based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
see note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
the impact of currency translation decreased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million for fiscal research and development expenditures  which are classified as selling  general and administrative expense  increased to million  or of net revenue  for fiscal  compared with of net revenue last year 
restructuring costs we recorded a pre tax charge of million during fiscal and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with our restructuring to reduce costs  better optimize plant utilization and reduce selling  general and administrative expenses 
the restructuring included facility closures that impacted our operations in the americas and european regions 
we reduced headcount by approximately people after additions at the facilities where production was transferred 
in the americas region  we closed an industrial manufacturing facility in new england and ceased manufacturing in our detroit area automotive facility 
the automotive development center also located in the detroit area will continue in operation 
production from these facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region 
in europe  we closed manufacturing facilities in portugal and ireland and reduced the size of a development center in germany since announcing the restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal we also closed a manufacturing facility in slovakia 
production from these manufacturing facilities was transferred to existing plants within the region 
the timing of the cash expenditures associated with these charges does not necessarily correspond to the period in which the accounting charge is taken 
for additional information concerning the status of our restructuring programs see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
see also forward looking statements 
effective tax rate the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared with for fiscal the overall decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects higher fiscal earnings in countries with tax rates that are lower than the us rate offset by an increase in the valuation allowance for losses incurred for which no tax benefit could be recorded 
fiscal reflects a charge for goodwill impairment and an increase in the valuation allowance

revenue derived from the sale of new products we released within the last months as a percentage of net revenue was as follows for fiscal years ended june americas far east north far east south europe total americas region north and south america customer revenue in the americas region for fiscal increased from the prior year  due to a slightly stronger demand for electronic connector products  particularly in high performance products  including cable assemblies for the high end server market in supercomputer applications 
we have also seen some recovery in the telecommunications market  resulting in demand for cable harnesses in that area 
modest sales growth reflects the accelerated movement offshore of oems and contract manufacturers 
although management believes that most of the related revenue remained within molex  it contributed to sales in other regions and reduced the americas results 
the revenue loss was partially offset with an increase in distribution sales  industrial sales and new product sales 
integrated product sales grew at a faster rate than connector products  with the most significant increase from high performance cables and fiber optics products for computer and industrial market applications  as well as for the telecommunications market  which has finally stabilized 
far east north region japan and korea customer revenue in the far east north region in fiscal increased from the prior year in us dollars 
foreign currency translation contributed approximately million to the revenue increase 
a robust business environment in japan  a recovering economy in korea and a steady flow of new products stimulated sales 
the most significant growth in fiscal for japan came from advanced digital home entertainment products such as digital still cameras and portable audio players and from consumer electronics products such as game machines and plasma display panels for flat screen tvs 
growth also came from hard disk drives and printers for the computer market 
during the year  the region further capitalized on its ability to design more compact  higher performance products for the sophisticated end of the mobile phone business in the telecommunications market 
the region is developing new connectors for third generation g phones  which in japan include such high speed capabilities as tv and camera functionality 
as more global phone makers move to g technology  we believe the region is well positioned to grow 
revenue to the industrial market increased  largely due to servo motor demand and customer investment in new semiconductor equipment 
automotive design wins in japan were offset by decreased demand from korean automakers due to korea s sluggish economy 
in korea  modest strength in the electronics industry and the overall connector market was offset by reduced sales of personal computers 
revenue from integrated products grew at a faster rate than connector products in fiscal to counter pricing pressure  most integrated products are manufactured in our plant in dalian  china  which underwent a capacity expansion in fiscal far east south region singapore  malaysia  china  thailand  taiwan and india consistent with the migration of business from the americas  europe and far east north regions to the far east south region  customer revenue in the far east south region increased in fiscal in us dollars  compared with the prior year 
this region is now our largest and fastest growing segment 
the revenue growth in this region was driven by strong demand across the consumer products and computer markets  as well as the mobile phone sector of the telecommunications market 
our sales in china increased by as a result of customer demand supported by increased production capacity 
the biggest drivers of this growth were american  european and japanese companies moving their design and production to china and greater penetration of taiwanese multinational accounts 
we experienced strong demand in the mobile phone  notebook and desktop computer  consumer electronics and automotive markets 
products used in mobile phones constitute nearly one third of far east south sales 
consumer electronics is another important market for the region 
during the year  new products were introduced to keep pace with the ongoing migration from analog to digital technology 
the region is coordinating opportunities with our molex counterparts in japan to have these products designed in the far east north and produced in china 
in the data  networking and computing arena  we shifted our focus from telecommunications infrastructure equipment to the far stronger server market 
the region also grew in its traditional niche of personal computers and notebooks 
the automotive business in the far east south region  although still in its early stages  is accelerating 
our product pipeline grew to five times the level 
the big daimler chrysler  ford and general motors and their suppliers moving to china want local design  procurement and production  which the region can provide 
we plan to open a new plant in summer in chengdu  considered the detroit of china 
the new plant is expected to be our largest worldwide and manufacture products for the automotive industry and for other industries as well 
to offer customers a complete solution  the region maintains a balance between high precision  high technology manufacturing in singapore and commoditized capability in china 
european region customer revenue in europe for fiscal increased from the prior year in us dollars 
our cinch automotive acquisition  which occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of  accounted for million of the million in growth 
the remaining revenue growth in this region was primarily driven by demand for mobile phones in the telecommunications market and products in the industrial market 
the european connector market has been growing  albeit at a single digit pace 
the region is focused on the strongest markets that we believe are most likely to stay in europe 
these include connectors and integrated products for industrial  medical and automotive applications 
integrated products now account for approximately of the region s revenue 
during the year  the region won projects from customers engaged in land and marine based oil exploration  as well as manufacturers requiring our products for industrial controls  testing equipment and power management 
the region also increased its business with nokia  the only major mobile phone company still producing in europe 
management believes that the trend for european automakers  at least for the next five years  will be locally based and will rely on local distribution 
we believe the region is in a good position to fulfill this need with a broad connector product offering and a robust new product pipeline 
key initiatives in the region include improving capacity utilization  shifting more manufacturing to the region s eastern european locations  and using six sigma methodology to eliminate waste and enhance quality 
additionally  we are ahead of schedule with introducing lead free products and expect that we will deliver well in advance of the european compliance deadline 
gross profit we were not able to fully offset the negative impact of price erosion discussed earlier with the leverage on the higher sales volume 
the gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher raw material costs 
we estimate that we paid approximately million more for metal alloys primarily copper  gold and plastic resins in the current year compared with the same period last year 
although we implemented offsetting price increases to our distribution sales channel  we have not been as successful with the majority of our business 
our client mix skews toward large global customers and industries that make raising prices more difficult 
certain products that we manufacture in japan and europe are sold in other regions of the world at selling prices primarily denominated in or closely linked to the us dollar 
the gross profit margin was negatively impacted as the yen and e uro strengthened relative to the us dollar 
we estimate this currency transaction impact to be approximately million compared with the prior year 
also included in the results for fiscal are corrections of errors that reduced gross profit by million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
selling  general and administrative expenses the cinch acquisition added incremental selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million as compared with the prior year 
the currency translation impact further increased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million 
also  in connection with the resignation of our former auditor  responses to sec comment inquiries  and internal investigations authorized by our audit committee  we estimate that legal  accounting and other costs during fiscal increased by approximately million 
research and development expenditures for the year increased million to million  or of net revenue  compared with of net revenue last year 
research and development expenditures in fiscal contributed to the release of approximately new products during the year 
in fiscal  of net revenue was derived from the sale of products we released within the last three years 
we continued our long term commitment to reinvesting our profits in new product design and tooling to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
we were granted new patents during the year  an increase of over the prior year 
also included in the results for fiscal are corrections of errors that increased selling  general and administrative expense by million 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
restructuring costs we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million in fiscal we did not have material restructuring activity during fiscal goodwill and other asset impairments we also recorded a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  during fiscal we did not record any material impairments during fiscal year other income total other income was million for fiscal  compared with million in the prior year 
fiscal results included a million gain resulting from an ipo completed by an affiliate and the sale of stock of this affiliate  as well as a loss on investment of million 
interest income  net of interest expense  was million for fiscal compared with million in the prior year period due to both higher cash balances held in the current year as well as higher interest rates 
effective tax rate the effective tax rate was for fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year reflects the charge for the goodwill impairment we recognized in fiscal and an increase in the valuation allowance for net operating losses in foreign countries for which no tax benefit was recognized 
these items were offset to some extent by the favorable resolution of various tax matters with tax authorities as well as the correction of accruals for income tax exposures and other income tax adjustments see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also reflected a tax benefit related to the recording of state deferred taxes in fiscal backlog our order backlog on june  was approximately million  a decline of million compared with million at june  the decrease in backlog was partially attributable to an increase in distribution bookings in june of approximately million placed in advance of a price increase 
in addition  during fiscal we provided vendor managed inventory programs to customers 
under this method  the new order and shipment occur simultaneously and without impacting reported backlog 
new orders for fiscal were  million  compared with  million last year 
financial condition and liquidity our financial position remains strong and we continue to be able to fund capital projects and working capital needs principally out of operating cash flows and cash reserves 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and million at june  and  respectively 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we expect to utilize a portion of our existing cash to fund the acquisition of woodhead 
our long term financing strategy is to primarily rely on internal sources of funds for investing in plant  equipment and acquisitions 
management believes that our liquidity and financial flexibility are adequate to support both current and future growth 
we have historically used external borrowings only when a clear financial advantage exists 
long term debt and obligations under capital leases at june  totaled million 
we ha ve available lines of credit totaling million at june  cash flows below is a table setting forth the key lines of our consolidated statements of cash flows in thousands cash provided from operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase in cash operating activities cash provided from operating activities increased by million for fiscal from fiscal primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal offset by an increase in working capital 
the working capital increase was primarily due to the revenue growth for fiscal as compared with the prior year and reflects severance payments approximating million in connection with the restructuring costs recorded in fiscal working capital is defined as current assets minus current liabilities 
cash provided from operating activities increased by million for fiscal from fiscal due mainly to higher net income as adjusted for non cash items in fiscal with steady working capital levels 
investing activities capital expenditures increased million for fiscal compared with fiscal in order to provide increased capability in the far east north region and increased capability and capacity in the americas and far east south regions 
capital expenditures increased million for fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to investments in increasing capability in the far east north region 
during  we also sold our investment in an affiliate and generated cash from this transaction of million 
cash flow from investing activities also includes proceeds from marketable securities in the net amount of million in fiscal and million in fiscal and investments in marketable securities in the net amount of million in fiscal our marketable securities generally have a term of less than one year 
our uses of or investments in marketable securities are primarily based on our uses of cash in operating  other investing and financing activities 
financing activities cash was used primarily for the payment of dividends and the purchase of treasury stock 
we purchased shares of common stock and class a common stock totaling million shares  million shares and million shares during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the aggregate cost of these purchases was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our board of directors previously authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate million of common stock though december  approximately million was remaining under the authorization as of june we have a strong cash balance and cash flow and a low level of debt 
we believe at this time that share repurchases are a good investment as compared with investing our cash in short term money instruments or marketable securities  particularly with the current low interest rates 
we also use shares repurchased to replenish stock used for exercises of employee stock options and employee stock awards 
as part of our growth strategy  we may  in the future  acquire other companies in the same or complementary lines of business  and pursue other business ventures 
the timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions we complete may impact our cash and borrowing requirements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations other long term liabilities debt obligations tota total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities or certain purchase obligations  as discussed below 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
in addition  some purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not generally have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed expected requirements for three months 
agreements for outsourced services generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty  and are therefore not included in the table above 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has i made guarantees  ii a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  iii any obligation under certain derivative instruments or iv any obligation under a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk  or credit risk support to a company  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services within a company 
we do not have material exposure to any off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk principally through the establishment of local production facilities in the markets we serve 
this creates a natural hedge since purchases and sales within a specific country are both denominated in the same currency and therefore no exposure exists to hedge with a foreign exchange forward or option contract collectively  foreign exchange contracts 
natural hedges exist in most countries in which we operate  although the percentage of natural offsets  as compared with offsets that need to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts  will vary from country to country 
we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments 
examples of these strategies include the prompt payment of intercompany balances utilizing a global netting system  the establishing of contra currency accounts in several international subsidiaries  development of natural hedges and use of foreign exchange contracts to protect or preserve the value of cash flows 
no material foreign exchange contracts were in use at june  and we have implemented a formalized treasury risk management policy that describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments 
under the policy  we do not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and the use of such instruments is subject to strict approval levels by senior management 
typically  the use of derivative instruments is limited to hedging activities related to specific foreign currency cash flows and net receivable and payable balances 
the translation of the financial statements of the non north american operations is impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in consolidated net revenue and income from operations was impacted by the translation of our international financial statements into us dollars resulting in decreased net revenue of million and decreased income from operations of million for  compared with the estimated results for using the average rates for our million of marketable securities at june  are principally debt instruments that generate interest income for us on temporary excess cash balances 
these instruments contain embedded derivative features that enhance the liquidity of the portfolio by enabling us to liquidate the instrument prior to the stated maturity date 
our exposure related to derivative instrument transactions is  in the aggregate  not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate exposure is limited to our marketable securities and long term debt 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of our investments less than months and the fixed rate nature of our long term debt 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to significant concentration risks relating to customers  products or geographic locations 
we monitor the environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
we have implemented an environmental program to reduce the generation of potentially hazardous materials during our manufacturing process and believe we continue to meet or exceed local government regulations
