item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our business we are engaged in the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of vascular disease 
our primary focus is the marketing and sale of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms  or aaa 
aaa is a weakening of the wall of the aorta  the largest artery of the body 
once aaa develops  it continues to enlarge and if left untreated becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture 
the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is approximately  making it the th leading cause of death in the united states 
prior to the acquisition of former endologix and the restructuring that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of see below under the caption merger with endologix  inc  we were researching  developing and marketing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
prior to that we developed  manufactured and marketed other catheter and stent products for treatment of cardiovascular disease 

table of contents between and  our source of revenues shifted gradually from direct sales of previous catheter and stent products to royalties from licenses of our stent delivery technology 
in june  we licensed to guidant corporation rights to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents in exchange for milestone and royalty payments 
our license revenue has significantly decreased and in reached the contractual minimum level of  we anticipate that license revenue will remain at this minimum level through the remainder of the license agreement  and that the sales of our powerlink system will become our only material source of revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash balance  in combination with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system  will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations through at least december  if we do not realize the expected revenue and gross margin levels  or if we are unable to manage its operating expenses in line with our revenues  or if we cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable ratio  we may not be able to fund our operations beyond december  in the event that we require additional funding  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
we cannot provide any assurance that the required capital would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any financing activity would not be dilutive to its current stockholders 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail our operations and this would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
company restructuring prior to  we were developing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
as a result of the clinical efficacy of drug coated stents  we determined that the market for the radiation based system likely will be limited 
in order to conserve cash and to position ourselves to take advantage of strategic alternatives  we restructured our business  resulting in the wind down of the development work for the radiation catheter system 
merger with former endologix  inc in may  we acquired all of the capital stock of former endologix 
we paid stockholders of former endologix cash for each share of former endologix common stock  for an aggregate of million  and issued one share of our common stock for each share of former endologix common stock  for an aggregate of  shares 
we accounted for the acquisition as a purchase under sfas no 
 business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in the merger  we acquired  in addition to the net tangible assets of the business  intangible assets such as the powerlink and powerweb an earlier version of the powerlink technologies  both developed and in process  the endologix trade name and powerlink and powerweb trademarks  and goodwill 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of 
table of contents litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale  and products have been shipped or used and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss 
we earn royalty revenue  which is included in license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations  as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to third parties 
royalties are recognized upon the sale of products subject to the royalty by the third party 
we do not offer rights of return or price protection and we have no post delivery obligations other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 
income taxes we reduce our deferred tax assets to zero due to uncertainties concerning the future realization of the related tax benefits  primarily due to our history of losses 
in the event we were to determine that we would be 
table of contents able to realize some or all of the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in increased income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to a full year of product sales after receipt of fda approval in october us sales increased from  to million  and sales to distributors outside the us decreased from million to million 
sales to edwards lifesciences ag commenced in the second quarter of  and were million in and million in there were no other distributors in that accounted for more than of product sales 
in  other than edwards lifesciences ag  only bolton medical italia spa accounted for more than of product sales 
sales to this distributor in were  license revenue 
license revenue decreased to  in from million in royalties on licensed product sales by guidant decreased to  from  in starting in september  we believe that guidant replaced certain licensed products with unlicensed products in the united states 
also  we believe the introduction of drug coated stents in early has had a material negative effect on guidant s sale of the licensed product 
as a result  the royalties from guidant reached the contractual minimum annual amount of  in royalty revenue from escalon medical corporation was at the minimum  in our agreement with escalon expired in october cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from million in this increase is attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to  offset by the decrease in royalties received from guidant and escalon  which did not have an associated cost of revenue 
gross profit on product sales increased to million from million in because product sales volume more than doubled in from gross profit  as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in this increase in gross profit margin was due to an increase in product sales in the united states 
direct product sales in the united states have a higher gross profit margin compared to international product sales  which are sold through distributors 
this impact was offset by a product recall and a facility relocation which resulted in period charges to cost of sales in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
we believe that gross profit dollars will increase in future years due to higher commercial sales of the powerlink system in the us for the same reason  we also expect that gross profit as a percentage of product revenues will increase in further  we do not anticipate a recurrence of the product recall or facility relocation which occurred in we do anticipate  however  that late in we will experience a sequential decrease in gross margin percentage when the cost of product sales will begin to reflect the effect of the significantly higher prices we are now paying for the raw graft material which we purchase from bard peripheral vascular systems  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in we expect that research  development  and clinical expense will increase somewhat in to a range between to million to support new product and process development projects 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales  marketing support  and customer service functions in support of the commercial launch of the infrarenal powerlink system in the us market 
we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase at a substantial pace in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the increase in expenses in was due primarily to expenses related to our review of 
table of contents internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as expenses associated with building the infrastructure in our finance and it departments 
we expect that general and administrative expenses in will remain at approximately the same level as in other income expense 
other income increased to  from  in  driven by higher interest income 
the increase in interest income was accounted for by a higher average invested cash balance in  which resulted from a private placement of our common stock which yielded aggregate net proceeds of million in july  and a higher rate of return on our investments 
comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in us sales increased from  to  and sales to distributors outside the us increased from million to million 
sales to edwards lifesciences ag commenced in the second quarter of  and were million in total in other than edwards lifesciences ag  only bolton medical italia spa accounted for more than of product sales in sales to this distributor in were  sales within the us were substantially comprised of powerlink systems for clinical trial cases 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased to million in from million in royalties on licensed product sales by guidant decreased to  from million in license revenue from escalon medical corporation was at the minimum  in cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from  in this increase was attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in the decrease in gross profit resulted from the million decline in royalties received from guidant  which do not have an associated cost of revenue 
gross profit on product sales increased to million from  in because product sales volume more than doubled in from gross profit  as a percentage of product sales decreased to in from in this decrease in gross profit margin was due to a charge of  for excess and obsolete inventories in due to expiring product 
in  we had a benefit of  related to the recovery of previously reserved inventory 
research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in legacy radiation catheter technology clinical trial costs  as those trials were nearly completed in costs for the powerlink infrarenal clinical study also declined significantly as new enrollments were completed in marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from  in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales  marketing support  and customer services functions in anticipation of the commercial launch of the infrarenal powerlink system in the us market which occurred in the fourth quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the increase in expenses in was due primarily to expenses of  related to our review of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
additionally  the total in reflects a reimbursement of  for legal and other expenses as part of a settlement in the first quarter of with jomed endosonics  and net bad debt recoveries of  other income expense 
other income increased to  from  in  driven by  higher interest income and  of foreign currency exchange gains in the period 
the increase in interest income was more than accounted for by a higher average invested cash balance in  which resulted from a private placement of  shares of our common stock at per share which yielded aggregate net proceeds of million in march in   of interest income was recorded as part of a legal settlement with jomed endosonics corporation 
there was no corresponding amount in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding for our operations 
in july  we completed a private placement of our common stock  which resulted in aggregate net proceeds of million 
additionally  in july and march  we completed two private placements of our common stock  resulting in aggregate net proceeds of million 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  we expect to continue to incur substantial costs and cash outlays in to support powerlink system research and development  and us marketing of the powerlink system 
however  if we fail to effectively penetrate the aaa market  or if we fail to reduce certain discretionary expenditures  if necessary  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all  which would adversely affect the operations of our business 
in december  the board of directors approved the funding for a plan to relocate both our manufacturing and headquarters functions to a  square foot leased facility  located in irvine  ca 
we completed spending of approximately million during for the construction of leasehold improvements  clean room space  equipment  and furniture for this facility 
we do not anticipate undertaking a similar project of this magnitude in the timing and amount of our future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of market acceptance of the powerlink system  our requirements for additional manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional it infrastructure and systems  our requirements for additional office space  and the success of our research and development programs for future products and processes 
in july  the board of directors authorized a program for repurchases of our outstanding common stock of up to million under certain parameters 
as of december   we had repurchased an aggregate of  shares for  with the last such purchase in the quarter ended september  at this time  we do not anticipate further share repurchases 
accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from  at december  the increase was due to the increase in sales in other receivables 
other receivables decreased to  at december  from  at december  this was due to the decrease in royalties receivable from guidant 
see comparisons of and in the license revenue subsection  regarding guidant royalty revenues  above 
inventories 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to higher sales in  and the need to build a safety stock in anticipation of the time required for fda approval of production at our new manufacturing facility 
such approval was received in february  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in purchases from bard peripheral vascular systems for a key component of the powerlink system and an increase in accrued compensation related to our performance compensation plan 

table of contents cash used in operations 
cash used in operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the increase in net loss in as compared to cash provided by investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   as compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of available for sale securities in as compared to  offset by an increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments in february  the former endologix agreed to purchase a key component for its powerlink product from bard peripheral vascular systems  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc  which at the time was a significant stockholder and thus a related party  under a supply agreement that expires in december  and which then automatically renews for additional one year periods without notice  unless a party provides notice not to renew within thirty days from the expiration of the renewal period 
under the terms of the agreement  we have agreed to purchase certain unit quantities of the component  with built in annual quantity increases 
in january  the agreement was amended  increasing the minimum quantity purchase requirements for and thereafter  and increasing the prices each year after according to the general increase in the consumer price index  with an additional increase when we received fda approval to commercially distribute our devices in the us  which occurred in october we are economically dependent on this vendor  which is the sole source for this key component 
during  we purchased million of such materials  which fulfilled the purchase commitment 
as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligation a a represents estimates of obligations under the bard peripheral vascular systems component purchase contract 
the total cost of the components is determined by the mix of sizes of graft material that we purchase  as well as the number of components purchased 
under the agreement  each year we must buy of the minimum or actual number of units purchased  whichever is higher  in the prior year 
the cost of the component is determined by the size of the graft piece purchased  and we do not currently know what sizes we will be purchasing after in order to estimate the sizes to be purchased for  and for years thereafter until the contract terminates at the end of  we assumed that the minimum amount purchased in increased by each year 
please see the paragraph  above  for more information on the bard peripheral vascular systems agreement 
in june  we entered into an agreement under which a third party will develop  install and test manufacturing equipment for the expansion of our manufacturing capability 
over a period from january through march  we anticipate spending approximately  to complete this project 
through december  we incurred costs of approximately million associated with this capital project 
we can terminate the agreement on days notice  and we would be responsible for costs incurred to the date of termination 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for 
table of contents equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
we adopted sfas r on january   which requires our compensation cost to be recorded as an expense for the portion of outstanding unvested awards  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
based on unvested stock options currently outstanding  the impact of potential new stock option grants and the expense that will be associated with the employee stock purchase plan  we expect that compliance with sfas r will have a material effect on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  which revised arb  relating to inventory costs 
this revision is to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that these items be recognized as a current period charge regardless of whether they meet the criterion specified in arb in addition  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  or fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act  or ajca  introduces a special tax deduction on qualified production activities 
fas clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special tax deduction in accordance with statement pursuant to the ajca  we were not entitled to this special deduction in  as the deduction is applied to taxable income after taking into account net operating loss carryforwards and we have significant net operating loss carryforwards that will fully offset taxable income 
we do not expect the adoption of this new tax provision had no material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  or fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of the ajca introduces a limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fas no 
provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
to achieve the deduction  the repatriation must occur by the end of the adoption of this new tax provision had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets  which changes the guidance in apb opinion  accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and fas no 
sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas sfas is required to be adopted in fiscal years 
table of contents beginning after december  we do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instrument issues under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas no

we are currently evaluating the impact that sab will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations when we adopt it in fiscal in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows but do not expect it to have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper and government bonds all with remaining maturities of less than two years and denominated in us dollars 

table of contents the table below provides information about our available for sale investment portfolio  including funds designated as restricted cash 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in the subsequent twelve month periods ending december fair value at december  total cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash weighted average interest rate investments weighted average interest rate total portfolio weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as the majority of our assets are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transactions are not material 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded   and  respectively  of foreign exchange gains losses 
accordingly  we do not have a significant currency exposure at december
