we caution readers that we assume no obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our liner and rail ferry segments voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
on our liner services  the voyage revenues are known at the beginning of the vessel s voyage and are reported through the date of the financial statements based on the relative transit time  which is the time between the vessel s loading port to the vessel s discharge port 
variances from initial revenue estimates are generally not material 
voyage expenditures are estimated at the beginning of the vessel s voyage based on historical cost standards and current estimates received from our vendors and port agents 
provisions for loss voyages are recorded when contracts for the voyages are fixed and when losses become apparent for voyages in progress 
during the course of the vessel s voyage  typically to days  actual costs replace the original estimates and become part of the historical cost standards 
because of our on going voyage review process  all variances from our original revenue and expense estimates are reported timely and generally are not material or recurring 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets and due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain of our foreign operations are subject to us income taxes when those earnings are repatriated to the us the jobs creation act  which became effective for our company on january   changed the united states tax treatment of the foreign operations of our us flag vessels and our foreign flag shipping operations 
we made an election under th e jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under a new tonnage tax regime rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime 
self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for hull and machinery and loss of hire for each policy year based on independent actuarial estimates  and to maintain the provisions at those levels for the estimated run off period  approximately two years from the inception of that period 
we also establish provisions for p i insurance deductibles based on internal estimates 
we believe most claims will be reported  or estimates for existing claims will be revised  within this two year period 
subsequent to this two year period  self insurance provisions are adjusted to reflect our current estimate of loss exposure for the policy year 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estima ted potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
however  if during this two year period our estimate of loss exposure exceeds the actuarial estimate  then additional loss provisions are recorded to increase the self insurance provisions to our estimate of the eventual claims settlement cost 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results coul d differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we are also indemnified for certain of these claims by the previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ from those estimate s 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
results of operations our vessels are operated under a variety of charters and contracts 
the nature of these arrangements is such that  without a material variation in gross voyage profits total revenues less voyage expenses and vessel and barge depreciation  the revenues and expenses attributable to a vessel deployed under one type of charter or contract can differ substantially from those attributable to the same vessel if deployed under a different type of charter or contract 
accordingly  depending on the mix of charters or contracts in place during a particular accounting period  our revenues and expenses can fluctuate substantially from one period to another even though the number of vessels deployed  the number of voyages completed  the amount of cargo carried  and the gross voyage profit derived from the vessels remain relatively constant 
as a result  fluctuations in voyage revenues and expenses are not necessarily ind icative of trends in profitability  and our management believes that gross voyage profit is a more appropriate measure of operating performance than revenues 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses variations in gross voyage profits rather than variations in revenues 
executive summary our net income for the twelve months ended december   was million as compared to million for same period of net income for included a tax adjustment discussed later in this summary of million associated with the jobs creation act 
our operating results were impacted by the hurricanes that struck the us gulf coast in august and september of resulting in after tax losses of approximately million primarily related to our rail ferry and liner services segments 
we also decided during the year to discontinue the operations of our over the road car transportation truck company and sold the associated assets early in the third quarter 
the operating losses for the year and the loss on the sale of those assets totaled approximately million after taxes 
the operating results for were favorably impacted by carrying more supplemental cargoes on our pctc s than in and profitable results from two container ships that were acquired near the end of late in the third quarter of  we acquired a fifth modern high specification us flag pctc that we fixed on a long term charter 
our investments in two companies owning cement carrier vessels and bulk carrier vessels  respectively  contributed approximately million  after taxes  to our net income for the year as compared to million  after taxes  for this included a before tax gain of million from the sale of one of the cement carriers 
the company owning bulk carriers had a high percentage of voyage cargo contract of affreightment coverage in  but a significant increase in unhedged bunker fuel costs and a change in market rates resulted in lower results for the year 
our us flag coal carrier operating in our time charter contracts segment did not operate as many days beyond its charter obligation in as in due to market conditions 
the charter obligation does not require employment of the vessel for the full year 
our us flag and foreign flag lash liner services experienced stronger cargo volumes and a more profitable cargo mix during as compared to the us flag service was affected by higher fuel costs while the effect on the foreign flag service was mitigated by fuel surcharges passed on to our customers that substantially covered those costs 
this segment was impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita  which caused operational delays and had implications on vessel scheduling resulting in lost revenue and additional costs 
lower productivity at our lash barge maintenance facility resulted from reduced labor availability after the hurricanes has forced us to delay planned maintenance 
after considering that the cost of that maintenance has been deferred to later periods  we estimate the total impact of the hurricanes on this segment for the year to be approximately  our rail ferry service  which operates between mexico and the us gulf coast  moved its us operations from mobile  alabama to new orleans  louisiana  during the year  which resulted in lost revenues and additional costs associated with the interruption in the service 
soon after the service was operating from new orleans  it was forced to cease operations due to the effects of hurricane katrina on the new orleans area in late august 
damages to the new orleans facility have been repaired  and the service resumed limited operations in early november from new orleans 
as discussed in the risk factors section of this report on page  we are considering all of our options regarding the service s us operations due to the uncertainty about the ability of the service continuing to operate from its new orleans terminal due to the effects of hurricane katrina 
we estimate that the lost revenue s and additional associated costs related to hurricane katrina for this service during were approximately million 
during  we also began the process of adding a second cargo deck to each of the two vessels operating in the rail ferry service in order to essentially double their capacity  and we will be making improvements during to the terminal utilized by this service in mexico to accommodate those decks 
while these projects were delayed after the hurricane  we expect the installation of the decks on both vessels and the terminal improvements in mexico to be completed by the end of the third quarter of the jobs creation act  which became effective for us january   provided us with the ability to elect to have our us flag international operations taxed under a tonnage tax rate rather than the us corporate income tax rate and changed the treatment of shipping income from controlled foreign corporations  which is generally no longer subject to us income tax until repatriated 
we made the tonnage tax election  and in we recognized a tax benefit of million on income from continuing operations before equity in net income of unconsolidated entities of million 
our tax provision would have been million higher under the us corporate income tax rate 
in  we adjusted our net deferred tax assets for the effects of the jobs creation act resulting in an adjustment to the tax benefit in that year of million 
in january of  we completed our public offering of million of convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
net income available to common stockholders for of million is after payment of dividends on this preferred stock of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner services gross voyage results for this segment improved slightly from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improvement was primarily a result of stronger cargo volumes and a more profitable cargo mix for both the foreign flag and us flag lash liner services  partially offset by higher fuel costs on the us flag service  higher vessel operating expenses and unanticipated costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
increases in fuel costs during for our foreign flag lash liner service were substantially covered by fuel surcharges passed on to our customers 
when hurricane katrina struck new orleans in late august of  the ships operating in this service were not located in the gulf of mexico 
after katrina  these ships berthed at lake charles  louisiana  rather than new orleans as an operating focal point 
two of the ships in the liner services were in  or in route to  the port of lake charles when hurricane rita struck that area in september of although the ships safely weathered the impact of the storm  they experienced significant scheduling delays as a result of port and waterway closures 
the costs associated with diverting to lake charles and baton rouge and the delays and other incremental operating costs attributable to the hurricanes were approximately million in operations at our lash barge repair facilities were significantly curtailed as a result of the hurricanes during the year deferring the cost of scheduled maintenance to future periods 
we estimated the net impact of the hurricanes for the liner services in was time charter contracts the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was attributable to gross profit from the two container ships acquired in december of  which we simultaneously chartered out  our us flag pctcs carrying higher volumes of supplemental cargoes  which provide revenues in addition to those provided by the time charter agreements  during as compared to  and the addition of our fifth us flag pctc in september of the increase in gross voyage profit was partially offset by a scheduled charterhire rate decrease on one of our pctcs during additionally  the results of our us flag coal carrier were lower than as the vessel  due to market conditions  did not operate as many days beyond its charter obligation  which does not require employment of the vessel for the full year 
contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in due to higher operating expenses  primarily fuel costs  in although the contract for the vessel operating in this segment includes provisions to escalate freight rates based on increases in fuel costs  that rate escalation occurs annually in september 
therefore  operating expenses for periods in which fuel prices increase will be higher for the time before rates escalate 
however  periods in which fuel prices decrease will benefit from the escalation since it is based on the previous years costs 
rail ferry service gross voyage loss for this segment increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this service normally operates between new orleans  louisiana and coatzacalcos  mexico  but the service was forced to cease operations after hurricane katrina at the end of august of through november   when we resumed partial operations 
we estimate that revenues lost in  because of the suspension of service  were approximately million and other costs related to the service interruption were approximately  resulting in an estimated direct impact of the hurricane on this service during the year of approximately million 
we expect the service to be operating with both ships  each with a second cargo deck  by the end of the third quarter of the new orleans transfer facility  rail yard  and vessel loading unloading facility are currently operating 
damages to the facility have been repaired  and repairs to railcars in our possession at the time of the storm are in progress 
our costs to repair damages in excess of our deductible levels are covered by third party insurance 
the service experienced some out of service days before hurricane katrina due to operational delays related to the move of our domestic operations from mobile  alabama  to new orleans  louisiana  that also contributed to the increased losses in compared to see risk factors section on risks relating to this service on page 
other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased slightly from million in to million in other income and expenses the gain on the sale of other assets of  in primarily related to the sale of lash barges no longer needed for current operations 
in  we had no sales of significant assets 
interest expense decreased from million in to million  net of capitalized interest of  in the decrease resulted primarily from early debt repayments in the second half of  repurchase of million of our senior notes in  and regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt  partially offset by higher interest rates in the gain on sale of investment in of  was related to the sale of stock from our portfolio of investments in our captive insurance company 
investment income increased from  in to million in primarily as a result of an increase in the balance of funds invested in the current period  primarily due to cash proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock completed in january of loss on early extinguishment of debt of  reported in was due to the early retirement of one of our loans  offset by the retirement at a slight discount of million of our senior notes due in the loss of  reported in was due to the early retirement of debt associated with our molten sulphur carrier  as well as the retirement of  of our senior notes due in at a slight premium 
income taxes in december of  we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under the new tonnage tax regime  which became effective for us on january  primarily because of the changes resulting from the jobs creation act  our federal tax benefit on our income from continuing operations for  varied significantly from the federal provision that would have been recorded using our statutory federal tax rate of 
in  we recorded a benefit of million on our million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
we would have recognized a tax provision during the period if we were still subject to the statutory rate 
however  income from our subsidiaries whose ships qualify for tonnage tax treatment had an effective tax rate of only for the period  which only slightly offset the tax benefit on t he losses generated by a subsidiary whose ships do not qualify for tonnage tax treatment 
this resulted in a tax benefit for a period in which we reported pre tax income 
we had a tax benefit for federal income taxes of million on income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities in  which included an addition to net income in the amount of million reflecting a reduction in our net deferred tax provision brought about by the enactment of the jobs creation act during the fourth quarter of passage of this new tax act  and our election in december of for our qualified domestic operations to be taxed under the tonnage tax provision of the new law  rendered certain net deferred tax provisions booked in prior years unnecessary

our investment in a cement carrier company contributed million  net of  in taxes  in including a pre tax gain of million from our share of the sale of a cement carrier  compared to  net of  in taxes  in discontinued operations in  we sold the assets associated with our over the road car transportation truck company 
the decision to sell these assets was primarily the result of a decrease during in the volume of business available to us due to the loss of market share by one of our customers and an industry wide shortage of drivers that caused underutilization of the assets 
the sale of these assets resulted in a net loss before taxes of  losses before taxes from operations were million in and  in the over the road car transportation truck company was reported in the other segment in previous periods 
those periods have been restated to remove the effects of those operations from the other segment to reflect the reclassification from continuing to discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner services gross voyage results for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improvement was primarily a result of higher cargo volumes in compared to for both our us flag lash liner service and foreign flag lash liner service resulting primarily from the repeal of steel tariffs which increased inbound steel tonnage 
additionally  the us flag lash liner service experienced a more profitable cargo mix in as compared to time charter contracts the decrease in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was attributable primarily to our us flag pctcs carrying lower volumes of supplemental cargoes  which provide revenues in addition to those provided by the time charter agreements  during as compared to the gross voyage profit from our us flag coal carrier was reduced approximately million by an accelerated drydocking due to required repair and upgrade work resulting in sixty four out of service days during contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit for this segment was approximately the same for compared to this segment experienced an increase in cargo volume in but also experienced higher operating costs as a result of machinery deficiencies  which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs  and weather delays resulting from hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs 
rail ferry service gross voyage loss for this segment increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this service experienced higher operating costs due to unanticipated maintenance problems which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs  higher fuel costs which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs  and weather delays as a result of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico which contributed approximately  to the segment s operating costs see risk factors section on risks relating to this service on page 
other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in the decrease resulted primarily from a casualty on one of our vessels that our insurance subsidiary covered for the policy year ended june  other income and expenses in  we had no sales of significant assets 
gain on sale of other assets of million in primarily related to the sale of our multi purpose vessel  which completed its commitment under charter with the msc and was no longer needed for operations  and the sale of special purpose barges no longer needed for current operations 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in decreases due to regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt accounted for  of the difference 
reduced cost from the early repayment of our senior notes due in  as well as other early debt retirements  accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
investment income decreased from million in to  in primarily as a result of million of dividends received in from our investment in bulk carrier companies accounted for under the cost method 
we sold our investment in these bulk carrier companies at the end of the decrease also resulted from lower interest rates earned on invested funds in the current period  partially offset by higher invested balances 
loss on early extinguishment of debt of  reported in was due to the early retirement of debt associated with our molten sulphur carrier  as well as the retirement at a slight premium of  of our senior notes due in the loss of million in resulted from a make whole prepayment penalty and write off of deferred financing charges associated with the prepayment of our coal carrier loan 
this was partially offset by the retirement at a discount of approximately million of our senior notes due in income taxes we had a tax benefit for federal income taxes of million in and a tax provision of million in on income from continuing operations before equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 
the statutory rate was for both years 
year included an addition to net income in the amount of million reflecting a reduction in our net deferred tax provision brought about by the enactment of the jobs creation act during the fourth quarter of passage of this new tax act  and our election in december of for our qualified domestic operations to be taxed under the tonnage tax provision of the new law  rendered certain net deferred tax provisions booked in prior years unnecessary

liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital decreased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and by financing activities of million  partially offset by cash used for investing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
operating activities generated a positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation and amortization 
cash provided by operating activities also included an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables from the msc and us department of transportation  slightly offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily from the deferral of payroll tax payments until february of  resulting from relief provided to companies affected by hurricane katrina 
also included was cash used of million primarily to cover payments for vessel drydocking costs in  offset by cash distributions received from our investments in unconsolidated entities 
cash used for investing activities of million included the purchase of a pctc vessel in september of for approximately million  upgrade work on our rail ferry service assets of million of which million was reimbursed by the state of louisiana and city of new orleans  and our investment of million in a transloading and storage facility related to our rail ferry service  in which we have a interest 
these uses of cash were offset by the proceeds from the sale of the over the road car transportation truck company assets of approximately million and certain of our lash barges of  cash provided by financing activities of million included proceeds from the issuance of debt and preferred stock of million 
in january of  we received proceeds of million from our preferred stock offering 
we used million of the proceeds to repay the draws on our line of credit that were made in december of to purchase two container ships  and we have been using the remaining proceeds to fund the addition of the second decks to each of the two vessels operating in our rail ferry service 
we also received proceeds of million from the financing of a pctc vessel that we acquired in and million to fund a portion of our costs associated with the improvements to the louisiana terminal and the transloading and storage facility related to our rail ferry service 
cash provided by financing activities also included million for reimbursement of costs incurred for our rail ferry service expansion 
these sources of funds were offset by repayments of debt of million  of which million was for repayment on the line of credit draws  including the million discussed earlier  million used to repurchase million of our senior notes at a discount  million used to prepay a loan  and regularly scheduled payments 
at december   million was available on our million revolving credit facility 
the facility expires in december of preferred stock offering on january   we announced the completion of our public offering of  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share  or million in total 
the preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum 
the preferred stock is initially convertible into two million shares of our common stock  equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of our common stock and reflecting a conversion premium to the per share closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on december  all shares of the preferred stock  which is a new series of our capital stock  were sold 
debt and lease obligations we operate several vessels under operating leases  including three pctcs  a lash vessel  a breakbulk multi purpose vessel  a container vessel and a tanker vessel 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities and use certain transportation and other equipment under operating leases 
the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our debt and lease obligations that were outstanding as of december  debt and lease obligations s thereafter long term debt including current maturities operating leases total by period we are considering various options to refinance our senior notes when they mature in  including our available line of credit 
debt covenant compliance status as of december   we met all of the financial covenants under our various debt agreements  the most restrictive of which include the working capital  leverage ratio  minimum net worth and interest coverage ratios  and believe we will continue to meet these requirements throughout  although we can give no assurance to that effect 
if our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations or if we are unable to meet our covenant requirements  we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital  enter into additional financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
rail ferry service expansion we are in the process of adding a second deck to each vessel in order to essentially double their capacity  and we have made improvements to the terminal in louisiana and will be making improvements to the terminal in mexico 
additionally  we have invested in a transloading and storage facility in new orleans 
we anticipate our costs to complete these upgrades to be approximately million  and we expect reimbursement of million of our costs from the state of louisiana the state and million from the city of new orleans the city  resulting in a net cost to us of approximately million 
as of december   we have incurred costs totaling million and have been reimbursed million 
we have also recorded receivables from the state and city of million for reimbursement of costs incurred as of december  total project cost s incurred include million for the louisiana terminal  million for improvements to the transloading and storage facility  million for the second decks  and million for our interest in the transloading and storage facility company 
the costs associated with the louisiana terminal and improvements to the transloading and storage facility are reported in leasehold improvements on our balance sheet as of december   and the reimbursements to us from the state and the city are recorded as deferred credits under lease incentive obligation for the long term portion and accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the current portion 
the leasehold improvements and deferred credits are being amortized over the year lease term  which began in the third quarter of the receivables of million for reimbursements as of december   include million from the state and  from the city 
the state funds have been appropriated for this project and are held by a trustee 
although we believe the city funds of  are collectible  we cannot guarantee that the impact of hurricane katrina on the city will not affect our ability to collect these funds 
if the city does not reimburse that portion of the project  the aforementioned deferred credit will be reduced by  which would reduce the amortization of the deferred credit over the remainder of the lease term and result in higher net costs for the project 
early in the fourth quarter of  we received proceeds of million from a seven year loan that we are using to fund a portion of our costs associated with the improvements to the louisiana terminal and the transloading and storage facility 
we expect the installation of the decks on both ships and the terminal in mexico to be completed by the end of the third quarter of we believe that this expansion will significantly reduce our cost per unit of cargo carried and significantly increase our cash flow  but only if we are able to book substantially all of the additional capacity  and we can give no assurance at this time that we will be successful in doing so 
we believe that the market will sustain these vessels for the foreseeable future  however  in the event that market conditions change  the vessels could be reassigned to other business subject to retrofitting 
although the rail ferry service operations were suspended due to hurricane katrina  we do not expect long term delays in completing the work planned for this expansion project 
the rail ferry service s transfer facility  rail yard  and vessel loading unloading facility were intact after hurricane katrina 
the railroads serving new orleans are actively working to repair the rail infrastructure and rail connections to new orleans 
we expect the cost of repairing the damages to the facility  including repairs to the railcars in our possession at the time of the storm  in excess of the applicable deductible levels to be covered by insurance 
our rail ferry service operates from a terminal in new orleans  louisiana 
specifically  the terminal is located on the mr go which is a federal waterway connecting to the us gulf of mexico 
as a result of the devastating flooding caused by hurricane katrina  the federal funding that the us army corps of engineers requires to dredge the mr go has been suspended 
while the current depth of the mr go is adequate to allow us to continue to operate  any further silting would prevent our long term utilization of the mr go 
therefore  as a result  we must review all options available to us regarding the continued operation of our rail ferry service including relocating the us operations out of the new orleans area 
the total cost to build our terminal on the mr go was approximately million 
the city of new orleans and the state of louisiana have contributed approximately million towards that cost  leaving our investment at risk at approximately million 
we have begun dialogue with the state of louisiana to discuss our options regarding our terminal on the mr go 
while we can give no assurance of the ultimate outcome of those discussions  we are satisfied that we will agree upon a fair solution 
in any event  the maximum impairment loss associated with our investment at the facility resulting from a relocation from the mr go  if we received no compensation  would be approximately million 
our investment of approximately million was funded with the proceeds from a financing agreement 
relocation of the terminal from our current location could potentially place us in default on this debt req uiring us to repay the unamortized balance 
additionally  we could potentially be required to compensate the lender for their cost if they lost the ability to utilize certain federal tax credits available to them in relation to our financing agreement 
maritime security program contracts in  congress authorized an extension of the msp through  increased the number of ships industry wide eligible to participate in the program from to  and increased msp payments to companies in the program  all effective on october  annual payments for each vessel in the new msp program will be million in years to  million in years to  and million in years to as of december   our us flag lash vessel  five pctcs and two container ships qualified for participation 
as of december   the us congress had not yet enacted the legislation to appropriate funding for this program for fiscal year at million per year per vessel 
therefore  congress passed a continuing resolution allowing this program to continue at fiscal year funding levels for all vessels qualifying for the program 
since the number of vessels in this program increased october   which is the beginning of the new fiscal year  and the total funds appropriated for fiscal year are higher than for fiscal year  the payments per vessel were lower for the period until the legislation was passed in january of and the funds were appropriated for fiscal year in january of  payments were received that resulted in fully compensating us for all periods since october   based on million per vessel per year 
cargo transfer facility as reported previously  we are evaluating whether to continue to operate our intermodal terminal facility in memphis  tennessee  because the volume of cargo from our lash liner services that is moving through that facility has decreased 
our lease of that facility extends through may of with future lease obligations of approximately  we are exploring the possibility of terminating the lease and are also marketing our assets associated with the facility  which are fully depreciated and have no carrying value  to partially offset any cost of the termination 
the impact on net income and cash flows of a lease termination and sale of assets could be significant and would be dependent upon our ongoing discussions with the lessor of the facility and our ability to sell the assets as well as the amount of proceeds received from any sale 
we are also reviewing other possibilities for utilizing the facility through the lease term 
dividend payments our preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  which are payable quarterly 
the payment of preferred stock dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors 
as a result of our preferred stock offering  we are restricted from paying common stock dividends and acquiring any of our common stock prior to december  environmental issues we have not been notified that we are a potentially responsible party in connection with any environmental matters  and we have determined that we have no known risks for which assertion of a claim is probable that are not covered by third party insurance  provided for in our self retention insurance reserves or otherwise indemnified 
our environmental risks primarily relate to oil pollution from the operation of our vessels 
we have pollution liability insurance coverage with a limit of billion per each occurrence  with a deductible amount of  for each incident

 statement of cash flows 
statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosures are no longer an alternative 
statement no 
r was effective for calendar year public companies at the beginning of effective january   we have adopted statement no 
r  which had no impact on our financial position and results of operation 
statement no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the related vesting period of such awards prospectively and record compensation cost prospectively for the unvested portion  at the date of adoption  of previously issued and outstanding awards over the remaining vesting period of such awards 
no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies record compensation costs for prior periods retroactively through restatement of such periods using the pro forma amounts previously disclosed in the footnotes 
also  in the period of adoption and after  companies record compensation cost based on the modifi ed prospective method 
we have adopted this statement using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement no 
 we account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
and as such no compensation expense has been recognized for employee options granted under the stock incentive plan 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations in future periods if we were to grant additional awards 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  there would have been no impact as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note e employee benefit plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f in november  fasb issued sfas no

sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  effective january   we have adopted sfas  which had no impact on our financial position and results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements  forward exchange contracts and commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december   would be approximately  or of the carrying value 
we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of and another in november of  in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is an asset of  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a  decrease in the fair value of the asset 
commodity price risk as of december   we do not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our liner services or rail ferry service segments 
we have fuel surcharges in place for our foreign flag lash liner service and our rail ferry service  which we expect to effectively manage the price risk for those services during if we had commodity swap agreements  they would be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices  however  they would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of appr oximately in our earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  however  a significant portion of that price increase would have been passed on to our customers through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period 
foreign exchange rate risk we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments with varying maturities throughout the exchange rates at which these hedges were entered into did not materially differ from the exchange rates in effect at december  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates applicable to these contracts at december   is an asset of approximately  assuming that none of the rate increases could have been passed on to our customers through currency surcharges
