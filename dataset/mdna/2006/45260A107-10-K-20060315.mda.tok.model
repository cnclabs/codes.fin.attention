item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business principally involves the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of proprietary cell based diagnostic and research products and certain service activities with a primary focus on cancer 
we believe that our products can provide significant clinical benefits by giving physicians better information to understand  treat  monitor and diagnose cancer and predict outcomes 
our technologies can identify  count and characterize a small number of circulating tumor cells  or ctcs  and other rare cells present in a blood sample from a patient 
we also employ our technologies to provide analytical services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to assist them in developing of new therapeutic agents 
we were incorporated in august in the commonwealth of pennsylvania as immunicon corporation 
in december  we merged with and into immunicon corporation  a delaware corporation 
in march  we obtained million in financing from the sale of our convertible preferred stock 
as a result  we substantially increased investment in our cancer related products and technologies  hired additional key management team members and redirected our business strategy 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to the development of our cell analysis platforms and diagnostic and research tools for applications in cancer 
in april  we completed an underwritten initial public offering  or ipo  of our common stock 
including the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  we raised approximately million  net of fees and other expenses 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share and received million  net of fees and other expenses 
these shares were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed in may as of december  we have received an aggregate of approximately million from the sale of our equity securities and have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
based on reaching certain commercialization goals  including sales of our products  we determined that as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of  we were no longer a development stage company 
we expect to incur losses  which may increase over the next several years as we conduct clinical trials to expand the uses of our technologies in metastatic cancers including metastatic breast  colorectal and prostate cancer and to earlier stages of the disease in breast and other cancers as well as for other potential applications of our technologies other than cancer  incur costs to place our cell analysis systems with customers and to support other commercialization activities  expand our manufacturing capability for instruments  bulk reagents  reagent kits and other consumable products  and develop applications of our technologies for diseases other than cancer  such as cardiovascular disease and for products to support drug development in cancer 
we are highly dependent on our collaboration with veridex 
in addition  we expect to continue to generate substantial losses for at least the next two years 
we will need to obtain additional funding to support the activities described above 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to obtain regulatory approval  that are outside of our control 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict the period in which we will achieve profitability 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections for a variety of reasons  such as our inability to obtain applicable clearances from the fda or institutional or ethical review boards or to enroll patients at the rate that we expect 
moreover  the product candidates we are developing must overcome significant technological and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
part ii veridex collaboration we expect that the majority of our revenues from product sales for at least the years and will be derived from our relationship with veridex 
we have a development  license and supply agreement with veridex  which provides veridex with exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize cell analysis products based on our technologies in the field of cancer 
in march  we began commercialization of products that incorporate our technologies for research use only  or ruo  including third party shipments of the veridex cellsearch circulating tumor cell kit  the immunicon celltracks autoprep system  and immunicon cellspotter analyzer 
veridex received k clearance from the fda  in january for in vitro diagnostic  or ivd  use of the veridex cellsearch circulating tumor cell kit in the management of metastatic breast cancer breast cancer that has spread beyond the primary breast tumor 
commercialization of our products for ivd use began in october in june  we announced the release for sale of our new rare cell analysis platform  the celltracks analyzer ii 
this product is the next generation analyzer to our cellspotter analyzer 
veridex received fda clearance in october for expanded claims for the cellsearch ctc kit in metastatic breast cancer 
we are responsible for all cellular research and development  including the costs of clinical development 
upon any sale by veridex of these reagent based products and test kits  consumable products and disposable items  veridex is obligated to pay us approximately of their net sales less the cost previously reimbursed for these products 
we are responsible for the sale of instrument platforms such as our celltracks autoprep system and ctaii 
veridex acts as our sales agent for the sales of instrument platforms and receives up to of the invoice price as a sales commission subject to a minimum gross profit margin  as defined in our agreement with veridex  received by us on each system of 
we are responsible for developing these cell analysis products and our cell analysis systems under the development plan 
we are also responsible for managing and administering all clinical trials under the development plan 
this plan is subject to the approval of a joint steering committee comprised of members designated by us and veridex 
veridex has the majority of votes on this committee  although the entire agreement is subject to arbitration provisions in the event of any disputes that may arise 
we must pay the first million in clinical trial costs for the first cell analysis product for general population screening for a major cancer  and veridex is responsible for the next million of such clinical trial costs 
we have agreed to negotiate in good faith for the allocation of costs in excess of million 
as of december   we have incurred no costs related to clinical trials for a product for general population screening and we do not anticipate spending any funds on clinical trials toward such a product through our agreement with veridex provides for a total of up to million in non refundable license and milestone payments related to research and development activities  including up to million for the initial license and up to million related to the completion of certain instrument and clinical trial milestones 
we have received million as of december  we have also continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on the company s product development or financial position 
we expect to earn the remaining million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria for a given future development milestone  we will not receive the applicable milestone payment 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria by the target date for a given milestone  we will continue to be entitled to receive the milestone payment in the future upon successful completion of the criteria 
however  veridex s obligation to pay us a percentage of the net sales for the specific cell analysis product to which the milestone relates would be reduced by for the ten year period beginning with the shipment for commercial sale of the first product resulting from this agreement 
in no event  however  would reductions due to missed target dates part ii reduce our proportionate percentage share of net sales for the product specified that we would otherwise be entitled to receive from veridex for sales of all cell analysis products by veridex under this agreement by more than in the aggregate 
in the case of the cellsearch product related to metastatic breast cancer we agreed with veridex that we did not reach a certain development milestone within the time period specified and therefore we will receive approximately of net sales for this product 
in addition  if we achieve certain levels of sales of our reagents we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments from veridex although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments related to sales goals until at least beginning with commercialization of the first ivd product under this agreement which occurred in october  we are required to invest in certain research and development activities an amount equal to at least of veridex s net sales  excluding revenues from instrument sales  from these products 
these research and development activities may consist of any activities  such as product improvements  product line extensions and clinical trials  conducted to achieve the milestones described below  to advance the development program designed by the steering committee for this agreement  or to enhance the cancer related cell analysis products or sample preparation and cell analysis systems based on our technologies 
however  beginning with the first calendar year after the amount of these net sales exceeds million we are only required to invest an amount equal to at least of these net sales 
we believe that we exceeded our funding obligation under this section of the agreement for the year ended december  we believe that we have manufacturing capacity available at our existing facilities and under our existing agreements with component suppliers to satisfy commercial demand through  at least 
veridex is responsible for filling and packaging costs for the reagents  as well as sales  marketing  distribution  customer and technical support and field service of our cancer products  including instrumentation 
we have retained worldwide commercialization rights to all non cancer applications of our technologies 
the pace and outcome of both our commercialization efforts and clinical development programs are difficult to predict 
as a result  we anticipate that our quarterly results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
in view of this variability and of our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
revenues we initiated sales activities for instrument platforms and reagent kits for ruo in the first quarter of and for ivd use in october from product launch through december   we have shipped cell analyzers celltracks analyzer ii systems and cellspotter analyzer systems and celltracks autoprep systems 
from product launch until december   we have recognized revenue from the sale of cell analyzers celltracks analyzer ii systems and cellspotter analyzer system and celltracks autoprep systems 
from product launch through december   we recognized revenues from the sale of systems to third party customers 
systems are comprised of one cell analyzer and one celltracks autoprep system 
these systems were sold to two major reference laboratories  to hospitals research institutes  pharmaceutical companies who intend to use the products in the development of pharmaceutical products  and to cros who offer testing services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients 
from product launch through december   we have recognized instrument revenues from a related party for the sale of complete systems 
in addition to these complete systems  we have recognized revenue from the sale of five celltracks analyzer ii instruments and one celltracks autoprep part ii instrument to a related party 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenue from the sale of cell analyzers celltracks analyzer ii and ten cellspotter analyzers and celltracks autoprep instruments and recorded million in instrument sales 
typically  when we ship systems to customers we grant a period of time to allow the customer to evaluate the system and to perform the required validation and training before requiring that the customer purchase the system 
therefore  recognition of revenue related to instrument shipments is typically delayed for a period of several months while customers complete validation of these systems in their laboratories 
for the year ended december   we had  in reagent revenue from the sale of test kits and other consumable products to veridex and to third party customers 
our agreement with veridex provides for a total of up to million in non refundable license and milestone payments related to research and development activities  including up to million for the initial license and up to million related to the completion of certain instrument and clinical trial milestones 
we have received million as of december  we also have continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on the company s product development or financial position 
we expect to earn the remaining million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
therefore  we expect that the revenue earned from license revenue will be inconsistent 
also  we expect to continue to invest significant amounts in research and development  particularly in clinical trials and platform development  and therefore we do not believe that these expenses will fluctuate in relation to when we expect to earn the milestone revenue referred to above 
in accordance with our policies for revenue recognition of milestone receipts we recognized   and million in the years ended  and  respectively  related to the veridex agreement 
under the veridex agreement  we also can earn up to million in revenue for achieving defined sales targets 
our agreement with veridex provides for payments to us by veridex of million  million and million in the first year that sales recognized by veridex of the cellsearch reagent products to third parties  excluding sales of instruments  reach million  million and billion  respectively 
we do not estimate that we will reach any of these sales targets until at least and therefore do not anticipate earning any sales based milestone revenues until then 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in developing reagent kits and instrument platforms and ancillary products  as well as the clinical research and trial costs to test these kits and systems 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  payments to third parties for instrument development activities and for research related support  expenses for materials consumed in research experiments and clinical research and clinical trials  and fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize part ii the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs for clinical research and for trials and to make investments to improve our instrument platforms and reagents 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  results from stock option grants to employees at exercise prices deemed for accounting purposes to be below the fair value of the underlying common stock on the day of the grant resulting in our recording stock based compensation expense associated with such grants 
stock based compensation expenses is also recorded for stock option and warrant grants to non employees and for restricted stock grants to employees  directors and advisors in lieu of cash compensation 
we amortize the deferred stock based compensation to operating expenses over the vesting periods of the options and grants  subject to adjustment for forfeiture during the vesting period 
during  we recorded million in deferred stock based compensation in the equity section of the balance sheet and recorded million as stock based compensation expense in operating expense 
interest income and expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
investment holdings for the year ended december  consists primarily of mortgage backed notes  federal agency notes and investment grade debt securities 
we have the intent and the ability to hold all of our debt securities until maturity and have recorded them at amortized cost 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on debt financings 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for inventory and of costs of goods sold  accounting for research and development expenses  estimating the value of our equity instruments for use in deferred stock based compensation calculations  and accounting for income taxes 
part ii revenue recognition we derive revenues from instrument and reagent product sales  service sales  license agreements and milestone achievements 
we recognize revenue on product sales in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab no 
 when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product or accessory has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for instrument placements at the time that all necessary conditions for the recognition of revenue have been met 
specifically  we may place instruments with customers and allow the customer a period of time for training and validation as is common in our industry 
therefore there may be a delay between the time that an instrument is placed with a customer and the point at which the revenue for the instrument placement is recognized 
also in certain instances the customer may be provided with an opportunity to return the instrument to us prior to acceptance 
we therefore recognize the revenue associated with these instrument placements only at the point when it is clear that all revenue recognition criteria have been met and that no continuing right of return remains 
in accordance with sab no 
 up front non refundable license fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated development period 
since august  we have earned and received million in license and milestone payments from veridex 
license and milestone payments are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the product development period as defined for each specific product 
amounts received as reimbursement for research and development expenses are recorded as a reduction in research and development expense as the related costs are incurred 
inventory capitalization in october  we launched our initial cancer diagnostic products  which received fda clearance in january we completed our first instrument sale to a third party laboratory customer during the fourth quarter of therefore  effective october   we adopted a policy for capitalizing inventory and recognizing cost of sales 
prior to october   all costs associated with manufacturing were included in research and development expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  we began to capitalize in inventory the cost of manufactured products for commercial sale and to expense such costs as cost of products sold at the time of sale 
however  as we sell that portion of our existing inventory that had previously been expensed as part of research and development expenses  there will be a period of time where we will recognize manufacturing revenue with minimum corresponding cost 
as such  our gross margin in fluctuated from quarter to quarter 
we believe that our gross margins will be distorted for comparative purposes through at least the end of and depending on market demand for our products 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in first out  or fifo method 
we include in inventory the raw materials that can be used in both production and clinical products 
these clinical product costs are expensed as part of research and development costs when consumed 
accounting for research and development expenses our research and development expenses are primarily composed of costs associated with product development for our cancer diagnostic tests 
future research and development expenses may be directed toward development of non cancer products such as products that may be used to diagnose and identify infectious diseases or cardiovascular disease 
costs incurred to date include the development costs for instrument platforms  clinical trial and development costs and the costs associated with non clinical part ii support activities such as manufacturing process development and regulatory services 
clinical development costs represent internal costs for personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted payments to third party cros to perform certain clinical trials 
we have a discovery research effort  which is conducted in part on our premises by our scientists and in part through collaborative agreements with academic laboratories 
most of our research and development expenses are the result of the internal costs related directly to our employees 
we accrue external costs for clinical trials based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  progress of the enrolled patients through the trial  and contracted costs with cros and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development and external costs related to non clinical trials and basic research when incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual costs incurred may not match the estimated costs for a given accounting period 
we expect that expenses in the research and development category will fluctuate for the foreseeable future as we allocate personnel to various activities  expand our clinical trial activities and increase our discovery research capabilities 
the fluctuations are difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing of clinical trial initiations  progress in our discovery research program  the rate of patient enrollment and the detailed design of future trials 
in addition  the results from each of our research programs and research trials will influence the number  size and duration of both planned and unplanned trials 
estimating the value of our equity instruments for use in deferred stock based compensation calculations through the end of fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation costs under the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to fas  or sfas  which allows continued application of the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation related to stock options is the difference between the grant price and the fair market value of the underlying common shares at the grant date 
generally  we issue options to employees with a grant price equal to the market value of its common stock on the grant date and therefore no compensation is recorded 
during the period from october  through december  prior to our ipo and determined with hindsight  we issued options to certain employees and directors under the plan with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  in accordance with the requirements of apb no 
 we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the estimated fair value of our stock on the date of grant 
deferred compensation is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the stock option 
in addition  we account for restricted shares to non employee members of our board of directors and officers using the intrinsic value method under apb we first granted restricted shares to officers during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for restricted stock awards made to our officers 
deferred compensation expense resulting from grants of restricted stock is recognized during the period in which the service is performed 
stock compensation arrangements with non employees are recorded as compensation expense over the contractual service period using the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair market value of the option at the original grant date as defined in sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
part ii in december  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options held by our current officers and employees with an exercise price of at least per share 
since the option price was in excess of the fair market value  or out of the money on that date  no compensation expense was recorded 
options held by our executive officers and members of the board were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
unvested stock options that had an exercise price of less than per share will continue to vest on their normal schedule 
as a result of this vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock have become fully vested 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce the compensation expense that might be recorded in future periods following our adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 share based payment revised  or fas r 
we expect that the future expense to be eliminated is approximately million over the next four years 
we believe that the options subject to the accelerated vesting have not provided sufficient retentive value when compared to the future stock option compensation expense because these options had exercise prices in excess of current market values 
we are required to apply the expense recognition provisions of fas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  which began on january  accounting for income taxes we must make significant management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
development stage enterprise up to september  we considered ourselves a development stage enterprise 
according to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises  in order to be identified as a development stage enterprise  the following conditions must be met planned principal operations have not commenced and planned principal operations have commenced  but there has been no significant revenue therefrom 
we have completed all the initial product development milestones outlined in our development and license agreement with veridex including completion of our clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer and the commercialization of both the instrument systems and the cellsearch ctc kit 
we began commercialization of our products in the second half of since launch we have sold products to customers throughout the united states and on a limited basis in europe and japan 
we completed the development of our cta ii and launched the instrument system in june the cta ii is the cell analysis platform which will be the basic cell analysis system for the forseeable future 
therefore  based on having reached these commercialization goals  as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of we were no longer a development stage company 
part ii results of operations years ended december  and revenue year ended december  in thousands product revenue instrument revenue instrument revenue from related party total instrument revenue reagent revenue reagent revenue from related party product revenue license revenue from related party other revenue total revenue instrument revenue increased by million in the year ended december  to million from  in this increase is primarily related to fact that we sold products for the entire year of compared to four months in we began selling our initial cancer diagnostic products in august we sold autoprep instruments  ten cellspotter instruments and ctaii s in compared to ten autoprep instruments  ten cellspotter instruments and no ctaii s in the ctaii was introduced in june reagent revenue increased by  in the year ended december  to  as compared to  in we expect our reagent revenue to increase in and beyond as we continue to increase the number of instruments installed and as veridex continues to promote the cellsearch test 
included in the revenue is approximately million of product revenue with no corresponding cost of goods sold 
license revenue from related parties increased to million in from  in on march   we successfully earned the milestone relating to the enrollment of the first patient into the bone marrow study 
veridex paid us  for achieving this milestone 
we will recognize this receipt as revenue over the estimated life of the bone marrow study which we estimate will be completed in the second quarter of in  we received  in milestone payments from veridex for achieving development related milestones during the license revenue for these milestones will be recognized over the respective estimated product development period which we estimate will end at various times through december  other revenue increased by  to  in the year ended december  from  in this increase is primarily related to testing services performed under our contract with pfizer  inc as a result of the above  total revenue increased to million in from million in part ii cost of goods sold costs of goods sold increased to million in the year ended december  from zero in we began capitalizing inventory and recognizing the corresponding cost of goods sold in october after the launch of our initial ivd products 
instrument cost of goods sold was million and reagent cost of goods was  for the year ended december  the instrument cost of goods sold includes estimated warranty service costs and other costs related to initial installation 
we typically sell our instruments at or near our cost 
we do not expect instrument sales to contribute significantly to gross profit in year ended december  in thousands instruments revenue cost of goods sold gross profit reagents revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research and development expenses a summary of the principal components of our research and development costs for the years ended december  and is shown below year ended december  research and development expenses in thousands salaries  benefits and taxes laboratory supplies and expenses instrument development costs clinical trial expenses contracted research costs depreciation insurance all others total research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in salary and salary related costs were  or  higher in compared to we required higher staff levels to complete the development of certain instrument platforms and complete the development of our initial cancer monitoring test 
we hired additional personnel during the second half of to support the commercial launch of our initial products  to support clinical development to expand applications of our cancer diagnostic technology and to expand uses of our technology beyond cancer to other disease states 
this increase was offset by part ii the reduction in salaries and other areas related to the staff reduction announced in august we expect that r d salaries will be lower in as a result of the staff reduction that took place in august the portion of stock based compensation expenses recognized as part of research and development salaries was million in versus million in laboratory supplies and expenses were million  or  lower in than in we began capitalizing inventory related costs in the fourth quarter of prior to that time  all product and inventory material purchases were recorded as an r d expense  principally as laboratory supplies 
as a result  inventory items that we expensed as laboratory supplies and materials in were capitalized in thereby reducing the lab supplies expenses for clinical trial expenses were million  or  higher in than in we initiated our clinical trials in metastatic colorectal and prostate cancer in the second half of patient enrollment for these trials was substantially completed by the end of we will continue to monitor the patients in these two trials in  but the majority of the costs related to these trials were incurred in instrument development costs decreased by  or 
in june we launched our second generation cell analyzer  the ctaii 
although we continue to make improvements to our instrument platforms  the principal development work for the ctaii was completed and costs associated with development of this instrument  especially contracted development costs  declined thereafter 
contracted research costs decreased by  or  in over we incurred higher costs associated with manufacturing validation efforts in the first half of as we prepared for the launch of our initial ivd products in august costs related to contracted research declined thereafter 
depreciation expense increased by  or  to million in compared to million in this was primarily due to the addition of space to our research facilities area in for additional research and clinical work being performed 
we expect that r d costs in will be consistent with levels or lower due to the effects of the restructuring that was implemented in august r d costs in the period after may be higher as we consider investment in additional clinical trials and product development activities both within and outside of the field of cancer 
for example  we plan to continue to invest in instrument development to improve performance of the various components of our instrument systems and to increase the capabilities of the systems in order to explore molecular diagnostic approaches for enrichment and analysis of cellular material 
also  we may continue to conduct clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of our cancer diagnostic products on cancers other than breast cancer and into earlier stages of the disease in breast and other cancers  and as we develop other diagnostic tools for use in diseases such as cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases and for use in tools for drug development 
each of our r d programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to obtain regulatory approval  that are outside of our control 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict the period in which we will achieve profitability 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections for a variety of reasons  such as our inability to obtain applicable clearances from the fda or institutional or ethical review boards or to enroll patients at the rate that we expect 
moreover  the product candidates we are developing must overcome significant technological and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in salary related costs increased by  in due principally to the addition of our chief operating officer who was hired in late to manage the cancer business  manufacturing part ii operations  regulatory affairs and strategic marketing and to other senior staff additions which occurred in and to support our transition to a public company 
also  in november  our board of directors approved a top management succession plan promoting our chief operating officer to president and chief executive officer  which became effective january  we recognized stock based compensation expense of  in compared to  in  which was included in salary costs 
professional fees  including legal and accounting fees  increased by  or  to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to costs associated with certification of our internal controls required by the sarbanes oxley act of and other public company reporting requirements 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will remain consistent with levels or may decrease in we have now completed the hiring of our senior management team and do not plan any major additions to the senior management in also  since we have completed the initial year of compliance activities required by the sarbanes oxley of  we anticipate fees relating to this process to decline 
we do not anticipate other large increases to our general and administrative expenses based on our current product development and business plan 
however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete our current product development plans or that we will successfully commercialize any new product candidates or that our anticipated declines in expenses will in fact occur 
interest income interest income increased by  or  in up to million from  in the increase in interest income was primarily the result of higher interest rates on our investments 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  or  to  in from  in this decrease was due to decrease in the average interest rate on new indebtedness in versus the higher interest rate on debt that was being paid down 
stock based compensation expenses during the period from october  through december  prior to our ipo and determined with hindsight  we issued options to certain employees and directors under the plan with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in accordance with the requirements of apb no 
 we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the estimated fair value of our stock on the date of grant 
deferred compensation is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the stock option 
we have also recorded compensation expense when stock options are issued to non employees such as consultants and advisors 
stock based compensation expenses were million and million for the years and  respectively 
we issued  options in and  options in in addition  we issued  restricted shares to certain officers in and recorded deferred compensation of million and compensation expense of  related to the issuance of these restricted shares 
we will amortize the deferred compensation through the vesting period for the common stock options and restricted shares 
in december  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options held by our current officers and employees with an exercise price of at least per share 
since the option price was in excess of the fair market value  or out of the money on that date  no compensation expense was recorded 
options held by our executive officers and members of the board part ii were excluded from the vesting acceleration 
unvested stock options that had an exercise price of less than per share will continue to vest on their normal schedule 
as a result of this vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock have become fully vested 
we recognized these expenses as part of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses as shown below 
year ended december  stock based compensation expenses included in in thousands research and development expenses general and administrative expenses net loss as a result of the above  the net loss of million in was million  or  lower than the loss of million in the loss per common share was in  which was  or  lower than the loss per common share of in weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  and were million and million  respectively

we sold ten cellspotters  eight of which were sold to veridex and two of which were sold to third party customers 
we also sold ten celltracks autoprep instruments  eight of which were sold to veridex and two of which were sold to third party customers 
part ii license revenue from related parties decreased to  in from  in we completed our initial product development period as of december  in the period from august through the end of we received million in license and milestone receipts under our agreement with veridex  including million in license and milestone receipts in we amortized these initial milestone receipts over the initial development period which ended at the end of we initially recorded these payments as deferred revenue and subsequently amortized these receipts over the initial development period 
in  we received  in additional milestone payments from veridex for achieving development related milestones during the license revenue from these milestones will be recognized over the respective estimated product development period  which we estimate will end at various times ending through december  in  we recognized  of license revenue relating to the milestones 
therefore  total revenue dropped to  in from  in research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in salary and salary related costs were million  or  higher in compared to this increase was due principally to hiring additional personnel to assist in the development of the celltracks analyzer ii cell analysis instrument and also to higher stock based compensation expenses recognized in this increase in stock based compensation expenses was the result of recording a full year of expense in versus three months expense in laboratory supplies and expenses were million  or  higher in than in we continued to expend funds for development of other applications of the company s technology in areas both within and outside of cancer diagnostics 
instrument development costs decreased by million  or 
although we continued to make improvements to our instrument platforms in  the principal development work was completed in mid and costs associated with development of the instruments  especially contracted development costs  declined thereafter 
clinical trial expenses were higher in by million  or  from in  we initiated our colorectal and prostate clinical trials 
also  we completed our initial clinical trial for breast cancer monitoring in early contracted research costs decreased by  or  in over we employed contracted support to help with certain validation activities related to preparing our manufacturing processes for initial commercialization 
these activities were concluded in large part by august depreciation expense increased from in to million in this was due to the change in our accounting policy together with the change in policy to capitalize inventory and report costs of goods sold 
in we began to allocate depreciation expense to research and development  general and administrative expenses and costs of goods sold 
through december   we reported all depreciation expense as part of general and administrative expenses 
part ii a summary of the principal components of our research and development costs for the years ended december  and are shown below year ended december  research and development expenses in thousands salaries  benefits and taxes laboratory supplies and expenses instrument development costs clinical trial expenses contracted research costs depreciation insurance all others total research and development expenses each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to obtain regulatory approval  that are outside of our control 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict the period in which we will achieve profitability 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays or rejections for a variety of reasons  such as our inability to obtain applicable clearances from the fda or institutional or ethical review boards or to enroll patients at the rate that we expect 
moreover  the product candidates we are developing must overcome significant technological and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in salary related costs increased by million in due principally to the addition of higher level professionals needed to assist with our public filings  a chief counsel to manage intellectual property and transactional matters  other legal affairs and various public reporting matters  a chief operating officer to manage the cancer business  and strategic marketing personnel 
in addition  included in salary related costs  we recognized stock based compensation expense of  in depreciation expense decreased by  or  to  in from million in this was due to the change in our accounting policy in connection with the change in policy to capitalize inventory and report costs of goods sold 
we now allocate depreciation expense to research and development  general and administrative expenses and costs of goods sold 
through december  we reported all depreciation expense as part of general and administrative expenses 
interest income interest income increased by  or  in to  from  in the increase in interest income was primarily a result of an increase in average invested cash balances in our increase in invested cash balances resulted from our ipo  which provided net cash proceeds of million and was completed on april  interest expense interest expense increased by  or  to  for from  for the increase was due to higher average interest rate on the debt outstanding in versus part ii stock based compensation expenses during the period from october  through december  prior to our ipo and determined with hindsight  we issued options to certain employees and directors under the plan with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant  in accordance with the requirements of apb no 
 we have recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the estimated fair value of our stock on the date of grant 
deferred compensation is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the stock option 
we have also recorded compensation expense when stock options are issued to non employees such as consultants and advisors 
stock based compensation expenses were million and  for the years and  respectively 
we issued  options in and  options in the expense in was higher than in because we record stock based compensation expense over the vesting period for the options 
therefore this expense is cumulative and will continue over the vesting periods of the various option grants which are typically four years 
also the expense was higher in because the difference between the fair market value of the stock and the option exercise price at time of issuance was greater in than in we recognized these expenses as part of research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses as shown below 
year ended december  stock based compensation expenses included in in thousands research and development expenses general and administrative expenses net loss as a result of the above  the net loss of million in was million  or  higher than the loss of million in the net loss per share was in compared to in in april  at the completion of our ipo approximately million preferred shares were automatically converted into million shares of common stock 
as the result  the net loss per common share of in was per share  or  lower than the loss per common share of 
weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through private and public equity and debt financings  license and milestone revenues from corporate collaborations  capital equipment and leasehold financing  government grants and interest earned on cash and investments 
in october  we launched our first fda cleared cancer diagnostic products 
we recognized million and million in product revenues in and  respectively 
based on reaching certain commercialization goals including sales of our products we determined that effective with the beginning of the fourth quarter of we were no longer a development stage company 
cash and short term investments decreased by million in the year ended december  to million from million december  this decrease was principally the result of the net loss of million for the year ended december   which was offset by the receipt of million in net proceeds from the sale of million shares of common stock in june part ii we used million in our operating activities in the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in net cash used of approximately million resulted from a decrease of cash received for milestone related activity of approximately million in and to an increase in inventory related purchases in of approximately million 
during we built inventory balances to support commercialization of products 
this increase in cash used to purchase inventory was offset by approximately million in net interest income in we generated a net increase of  in cash through our investing activities in the year ended december  and used million in our investing activities in the year ended december  in  we generated million through the purchase and sale of investments and we spent million to purchase property and equipment 
in we purchased million of investments  principally mortgage backed securities  federal agency notes and debt securities  of which million matured and we spent million on purchases of property and equipment 
we generated a net increase of million and million in cash through our financing activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in june  we raised million in proceeds  net of fees and expenses  through the sale of million shares of common stock pursuant to shelf registration statement filed in may we received cash proceeds from bank borrowings of million and made principal repayments of million in in  we received cash proceeds from bank borrowings of million and made principal repayments of million 
on april   we completed our ipo 
in the ipo  we sold million shares of our common stock at per share 
we raised a total of million  net of fees and expenses which totaled million 
at december  and  respectively  we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have funded our expenditures to date principally through the sale of our stock 
our expenditures are primarily research and development and other operating expenditures  capital equipment expenditures and payments on outstanding indebtedness 
sales of our common and preferred stock from inception through december  are as follows summary of all sales of common and convertible preferred stock year s number of shares price per share net proceeds in thousands equivalent common shares initial sale of common stock private convertible preferred stock series a series b series c series d series e series f initial public offering common stock sale of common stock secondary offering exercise of options and warrants and other sales of common stock various   on may   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec 
the shelf registration statement permits the offer  sale and issuance by us from time to time  in one or more offerings  of up to an aggregate of million of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  depositary shares  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
the terms of any offering will be established part ii at the time of the offering 
on june   we sold  shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to this shelf registration statement and received million in proceeds  net of fees and other expenses 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and related interest charges on lines of credit at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due in contractual obligations total and and after in thousands lines of credit  including interest expense operating leases open purchase order commitments total contractual obligations the amounts included in open purchase order commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our instrument platforms  which we anticipate will be sold by us to customers and for various items such as contingent patient accrual commitments related to our clinical trials 
most patient accrual costs are payable only after successful completion of patient accrual 
we are liable for certain payments under employment contracts with our executive chairman  chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief scientific officer and chief counsel 
these contracts require that we continue salary and benefits for these officers for a period of one year and that we accelerate any unvested options  if any  if the officer is terminated  except for cause  or in the event of a change of control  as defined in the contracts 
our obligations as defined in the employment contract with our executive chairman will cease as of march  when he will cease to be executive chairman but will continue to serve as chairman of our board in a non executive capacity 
we also have contingent obligations for research and development and clinical trial expenditures under our development  license and supply agreement with veridex 
specifically  we must pay the first million in clinical trial costs for the first cellular analysis product for general population screening for a major cancer  and veridex is responsible for the next million of such clinical trial costs 
we have agreed to negotiate in good faith for the allocation of costs in excess of million 
as of december  we have not incurred any costs related to clinical trials for a product for general population screening  and we do not anticipate spending any funds on clinical trials toward such a product through the development  license and supply agreement with veridex provides for a total of up to million in non refundable license and milestone payments related to research and development activities  including up to million for the initial license and up to million related to the completion of certain instrument and clinical trial milestones 
we have received million as of december  we have also continuously reviewed the status of the remaining development milestones and  where appropriate  have renegotiated the development requirement and payment terms 
we do not believe that these renegotiations will have a material adverse effect on our product development or financial position 
we expect to earn the remaining million in development milestone payments over the next three to five years 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria for a given future milestone  we will not receive the applicable milestone payment 
if we do not successfully complete the payment criteria by the target date for a given milestone  we will continue to be entitled to receive the milestone payment in the future part ii upon successful completion of the criteria 
however  veridex s obligation to pay us a percentage of the net sales for the specific cell analysis product to which the milestone relates would be reduced by for the ten year period beginning with the shipment for commercial sale of the first product resulting from this agreement 
in no event  however  would reductions due to missed target dates reduce our proportionate percentage share of net sales for the product specified that we would otherwise be entitled to receive from veridex for sales of all cell analysis products by veridex under this agreement by more than in the aggregate 
in the case of the cellsearch product related to metastatic breast cancer we agreed with veridex that we did not reach a certain development milestone within the time period specified and therefore we will receive approximately of net sales for this product 
in addition  if we achieve certain levels of sales of our reagents we may receive up to an additional million in milestone payments from veridex although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments related to sales goals until at least veridex is responsible under the agreement for obtaining all regulatory clearances  in consultation with us  for these cell analysis products in the field of cancer 
we have also established a sales agency arrangement with veridex with respect to our sample preparation and cell analysis systems 
under this arrangement  veridex is our exclusive sales  invoicing and collecting agent and exclusive instrument and technical service provider for these systems in the field of cancer 
veridex is responsible for all expenses for marketing  sales and training  and we are responsible for all development and validation as well as quality control and quality assurance 
we are responsible for shipping systems pursuant to purchase orders received by veridex 
we are obligated to pay veridex a commission on each sale or lease of these sample preparation and cell analysis systems of up to of the invoice price  subject to a minimum gross profit margin received by us on each system of  as defined in the agreement 
some customers may enter into a reagent rental agreement with veridex  whereby the reagent price also carries an amortized cost of the instrument  based on an agreed test volume 
in these cases  veridex will pay us a percentage of the fully loaded cost of the instrument when it is placed in the account 
we are responsible for the costs associated with the one year warranty period 
veridex has the option under the agreement to convert the sales agency relationship to a sole distributorship arrangement upon months written notice 
however  we do not anticipate earning significant gross margins or incurring significant losses on the sale  lease or rental of our instrument systems 
we anticipate that the majority of our future gross margins and future profits derived under our agreement with veridex will result from the sales of reagents and disposables 
we launched our first cancer diagnostic products in october this represents the beginning of the commercialization phase as defined in our development  license and supply agreement 
according to the development  license and supply agreement once commercialization begins  we are required to invest an amount ranging from between and of total net product sales by veridex  excluding revenue from cell analysis system sales  in research and development activities for cancer related cell analysis products 
these research and development activities may consist of any activities  such as product improvements  product line extensions and clinical trials  conducted to achieve the milestones described above  to advance the development program designed by the steering committee for this agreement  or to enhance the cancer related cell analysis products or sample preparation and cell analysis systems based on our technologies 
the agreement has an initial term of years and is automatically renewed for three year terms unless earlier terminated 
there are various conditions that allow either party to terminate the agreement  including a material breach by either party or by mutual agreement 
veridex may also terminate for additional reasons including upon a change of control of us  as defined in the agreement  at any time prior to commercialization of any cell analysis products under the agreement with or without reason part ii upon days prior written notice  or at any time following commercialization of the first cell analysis product under the agreement with or without reason upon months prior written notice 
at this time we believe the latter provision is in effect due to initiation of commercialization in in certain circumstances of termination  veridex may  at its option  retain certain worldwide rights to sell our cell analysis products if it agrees to pay us any unpaid license and milestone payments and an ongoing net sales royalty 
johnson and johnson development corporation beneficially own approximately of our common stock and is a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in available credit under our credit agreements 
the available borrowing capacity under our silicon valley bank  or svb  credit facility was million and it expires on june  and the available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement with general electric credit corporation  or ge  was million and it expires april  we were in compliance with all provisions of our various loans as of and for the years ended december  and the svb credit agreement contains certain covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a certain level of earnings or loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  maintain a minimum amount of our available funds on deposit with svb and deliver periodic financial statements and reports within a prescribed timeframe 
the agreements with svb and ge also restrict our ability to among other things  dispose of property including intellectual property  change our business  ownership  management or business locations  merge with or acquire certain other entities  create or incur certain liens or encumbrances on any of its property  incur or amend the terms of certain indebtedness  engage in transactions with affiliates  declare or pay certain dividends or redeem  retire or purchase shares of any capital stock without their prior approval 
on june  we announced that we  along with the fox chase cancer center  or fox chase  were awarded a small business technology transfer grant totaling approximately from the national institutes of health nih  which extends over two years 
we believe that we will receive approximately  and that fox chase will receive the remainder of  the nih grant is intended to fund the development of a new strategy to actively monitor the effectiveness of cancer drugs in clinical trials 
as of december  we have received  and fox chase has received  from the grant 
in august  we announced that we were reducing staff and other expenses in order to align costs with our commercialization strategy and revenue ramp and we reduced our workforce by approximately as of that date 
we anticipate recording total charges of up to million related to the staff and other cost reductions 
we made severance related payments  totaling approximately  in in addition  we recorded  in depreciation in related to the consolidation of space 
these expenses were recorded in operating expenses for the year ended december  we expect to incur charges of up to an estimated additional  such as those related to space consolidation  among others  in the first half of we anticipate completing the consolidation of office space in the first half of this workforce reduction represented approximately of full time equivalent domestic staff principally in research and development  operations and certain support functions 
a significant component of the workforce reduction involved employees who were engaged in platform development programs that are now essentially completed  such as our next generation cell analysis platform  the celltracks analyzer ii 
additionally  we had completed development of core reagents and ancillary components incorporated in cell analysis kits  most notably the cellsearch ctc kit  sold by veridex 
we continue to pursue important development projects such as clinical trials in metastatic colorectal and prostate cancer and research and development efforts on circulating endothelial cells and certain molecular analysis products 
the clinical trials in metastatic colorectal and prostate cancer are intended to lead to regulatory submissions for expanded claims for the cellsearch ctc kit 
based on our operating plans  we believe that our available cash and available borrowings under of lines of credit will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures until at least december  part ii our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  supporting our research and development efforts and our clinical trials  although we are not obligated to meet any absolute minimum dollar spending requirements under our current operating agreements 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope and progress made in our research and development activities  our clinical trials and capital requirements related to our commercialization efforts 
we had million in cash on hand and short term investments  million in long term investments which have a maturity of greater than months and million in available lines of credit as of december  we plan to use our cash on hand and our available lines of credit to continue to develop our cancer diagnostic products beyond breast cancer to other types of solid tissue cancers and to explore the uses of our technology in earlier stages of the cancer disease process 
also  we plan to explore development of uses for our technology outside of cancer such as in cardiovascular disease 
we plan to use the anticipated funds generated from the sales of our products as well as additional equity or debt related offerings to finance our future development efforts 
we may not be successful in generating sufficient product sales or raising sufficient funds from the sale of equity or debt securities to support the research and development expenses necessary to expand the uses of the technology into other cancers and in non cancer diseases 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in our product development efforts  additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may elect to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities 
this inability to obtain additional financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

share based compensation arrangements include stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
in april  the sec postponed the implementation date to the fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal we believe that the adoption of sfas no

the precise impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions was zero for the year ended december  in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no
