item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in august  we received a firm purchase order from lg electronics for its purchase from us of an aggregate minimum quantity of  lcos sets for the period july through december in october  we publicly announced that we had received the formal written qualification letter from lg electronics stating that we have met certain agreed upon technical specifications which had been the subject of prior informal approval in july 
we later agreed with lg electronics to move the initial six month delivery period to november through april we subsequently agreed with lg electronics  through a series of communications  that the initial purchase order for  lcos sets may be filled over a period of time that will extend beyond april we currently expect that the initial order for  lcos sets will be filled during the summer of this revised schedule has been based primarily upon changing expectations about our production output capacity and will allow us to conduct a focused ramp up of our lcos set production at our manufacturing facility in south korea 
in november and december  we delivered a limited quantity of production lcos sets to lg electronics based upon a revised delivery schedule 
our delivery ramp up has been slower than expected due to lg electronics product specification changes and certain difficulties in ramping up our manufacturing volumes 
see item management s discussion and analysis for more discussion of these problems 
the potential negative impact upon our results of operations that could be caused by difficulties in manufacturing our lcos sets are described under risk factors in item a 
in  a substantial percentage of our product deliveries  which were in small quantities  were made to lg electronics 
based upon our agreement with lg electronics  we believe it is likely that a substantial percentage of our anticipated future product deliveries in the first half of will be made to lg electronics as well 
the loss of lg electronics as a customer or any further delays in our delivery schedule to lg electronics could significantly harm our future sales and results of operations  and our substantial dependence on one customer is subject to risks set forth under risk factors in item a 
business in taiwan and china to date  we have delivered limited quantities of our t lcos sets to our taiwanese customer  thintek optronics corp 
the majority of these sales occurred in to date  thintek has ordered quantities sufficient for pilot programs and sample products  but not enough to enable them to launch mass production of lcos high definition televisions 
we have delivered limited quantities of our microdisplay products to our chinese customers 
a substantial portion of these product deliveries occurred in  with a smaller quantity delivered in the quantities of our products delivered to our chinese customers are sufficient only for engineering testing and pilot program purposes 
one of our original chinese customers  skyworth display ltd 
skyworth  has commenced sales of televisions utilizing our display units incorporating our t lcos sets into the chinese educational market 
to date  however  our chinese customers have not ordered quantities of our products that would enable them to launch commercial sales of lcos high definition televisions 
for a more detailed discussion of our business in taiwan and china  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
prospective customers we are currently developing working relationships with prospective customers  located primarily in japan and other parts of the pacific rim region 
while we have made progress with respect to product integration and negotiating purchase orders with certain of these prospective customers  we cannot assure that we will receive any purchase orders binding on any of these companies for their purchase of our products in the near future 
even assuming that we receive purchase orders that are binding on the prospective customers  these orders and our sales to these customers and to our existing customers are subject to certain contingencies described under risk factors in item a 
in may  we opened a representative office in shanghai  china  for the purpose of conducting  coordinating and supporting our business relations with our chinese customers and prospective customers 
technology and products under development our microdisplays are high resolution liquid crystal displays 
they are constructed with a silicon chip  a layer of liquid crystals and a glass cover plate in contrast to the more common construction of liquid crystals sandwiched between two glass plates 
our displays are also known as  and commonly referred to as  liquid crystal on silicon lcos  liquid crystal displays lcd  active matrix liquid crystal displays and spatial light modulators 
we are currently offering one core product to our customers and prospective customers who are located primarily in asia 
the featured product is our lcos set  which is comprised of three of our proprietary spatialight imagengine lcos microdisplays 
we currently are focused on manufacturing one model of our lcos sets  the t lcos set model which has a pixels by pixels configuration 
we have previously manufactured and continue to have in inventory our t lcos set model which has a pixels by pixels configuration 
although we believe we can sell our t lcos set model  we are exclusively focusing on manufacturing the t model of our lcos sets because we believe that the market demand for that higher resolution product will be significantly greater 
the following table summarizes our sales revenue percentage by product for the past three years lcos t sets lcos t sets light engine display units other primarily supporting electronics total the image on a microdisplay can be projected onto a screen or other surface for individual or group viewing or used in a portable application that is viewed through a magnifying device similar to a viewfinder 
potential microdisplay applications include large screen rear projection television systems  in both high definition television format and standard television formats  large screen rear projection computer monitors in a variety of resolutions  video projectors for applications such as presentations  head mounted displays which are used for virtual reality systems  defense  aerospace and gaming applications  and other potential applications such as point of purchase displays  optical computing and data storage 
our technology uses liquid crystals and silicon chips 
an advantage of these materials is that processes for working with them are already known and they may be produced more quickly than competing technologies that offer comparable quality 
by using existing manufacturing processes at our manufacturing facility in south korea  which commenced producing products for commercial sale in limited quantities in the second quarter of  we believe we will be able to obtain economies of scale 
a typical liquid crystal display  as might be found in a notebook computer  basically consists along with other associated materials and processes of liquid crystal material sandwiched between two pieces of glass  polarizers  color filters  a data signal and a light source 
as the data signal is applied across the sandwich of the liquid crystals  the electric field created by this data signal causes the liquid crystals to tilt 
this tilting  combined with the polarizers  makes each pixel change from opaque to transparent  thereby controlling either the transmission or reflection of light from each pixel 
departing from typical liquid crystal displays utilizing circuitry on two pieces of glass  we design integrated circuits that control individual reflective pixels on a silicon substrate 
this silicon substrate is manufactured using a conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos process 
this processed silicon substrate  also known as a silicon backplane  then has the liquid crystal material and a cover glass applied to it 
when the data signal is sent to the circuitry in the silicon  the liquid crystals again tilt from opaque to transparent states 
when polarizers are added and light is reflected from the pixels on the silicon  images can be viewed directly or  using standard optical techniques  projected into larger images on a screen 
as is common with all lcds  the images produced are inherently black and white 
the varying of the electrical signal to each pixel produces gray scaling various shades of gray going from black to white 
utilizing this gray scaling  there are three basic techniques for achieving color displays optically combining different colors of light  sequential color systems and color filters 
we believe our displays can be adapted for use in all of these types of color display processes 
the display industry has undergone and continues to undergo rapid and significant technological change 
we expect display technologies to continue to develop rapidly  and our success will depend significantly on our ability to attain and maintain a competitive position 
rapid technological development may result in our products or processes becoming obsolete before we recoup a significant portion of related research and development  acquisition and commercialization costs 
our ability to compete will depend in part upon many factors  including the quality of the display images  manufacturing  capacity  delivery  pricing and technical specifications 
in addition  there will be factors within and outside of our control  including customer support and the success and timing of product introduction and distribution by our customers 
our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are equally or more efficient than any which we are developing  which will render our technology  displays and other products obsolete and non competitive 
marketing  sales and distribution application and markets we are currently working with a number of oem customers and prospective customers  located primarily in south korea  japan  taiwan and china  to use our microdisplay products in their high definition television end product applications 
we do not believe that designing  selling and distributing end products for these diverse markets is in our own best interests 
in high volume applications  we currently are and expect to continue custom designing our microdisplay products to fit a specific manufacturer s need for a specific product 
our lcos sets can be incorporated into a wide variety of products such as high definition televisions  rear projection computer monitors  video projectors and head mounted displays 
our current strategy is to focus our resources and expertise on original equipment design oed of lcos sets and to work closely with high definition television oems and light engine oems to market end products utilizing our microdisplays 
we are therefore dependent upon these oems for the manufacturing  marketing and selling of end products 
segment and geographical information for the year ended december   and of our revenue was derived from lg electronics  located in south korea and thintek optronics corp  located in taiwan  respectively 
these two customers made up of our outstanding accounts receivable balance at december  the remaining of revenue in was derived from the sales of our lcos sets and related components to customers located in hong kong  china and the united states 
for the year ended december   and of our revenue was derived from skyworth tv holdings  ltd 
and shanghai china display co  ltd  both located in china 
these two customers made up of our outstanding accounts receivable balance at december  the remaining of revenue in was derived from the sales of our lcos sets and related components to customers located in hong kong  taiwan and south korea 
for the year ended december   and of our revenue was derived from skyworth  and china display  both located in china 
the remaining of revenue in was derived from the sales of our lcos sets and related components to customers located in china and hong kong 
manufacturing and supply through the end of  we manufactured our lcos sets in limited commercial quantities at our facilities in south korea and california 
early in  we moved all of our manufacturing operations to our facility in south korea and transitioned the california facility to research and development and special project operations 
internal manufacturing is subject to certain risks described under risk factors in item a 
in september  we entered into a fifty year term lease with the gyeongnam provincial government for acres of undeveloped land in jinsa  gyeongnam province in south korea 
we leased the land for the purpose of constructing a state of the art manufacturing facility with the anticipated capacity to meet mass production scale demand from our customers and prospective customers 
we have received a land lease payment exemption because the land has been designated a free economic zone by the south korean national government and the south korean government also certified us as a high technology company 
under our agreement with the gyeongnam provincial government we could lose our land lease payment exemption in the event that we lose our high technology certification 
we completed construction of our south korean manufacturing facility in january the south korean facility has commenced to serve as our central commercial manufacturing base 
the facility began producing products for commercial sale in limited quantities in the second quarter of the facility is designed with the capacity  on full employment  to produce up to  lcos sets per month 
the facility has been specially designed for expansion to a capacity of  lcos sets per month in several expansion phases 
we believe that the facility can be expanded in an efficient manner in the event that such expansion becomes necessary based upon increased or perceived increased demand for our products from our customers 
our entire manufacturing operations are now conducted at our facility in south korea 
we have recently experienced certain problems in manufacturing our lcos sets 
see item for a more detailed discussion of those problems 
we recently transferred certain specific portions of our manufacturing process from california to our facility in south korea so that the entire manufacturing operation now occurs in south korea 
the transfer of those specific portions of the process caused a delay in manufacturing operations while production equipment was physically transferred from california to south korea and south korean employees were trained to use that equipment 
however  we believe that having manufacturing take place in one location will allow us to maintain a higher level of quality controls over lcos set production  which we expect will increase our long term manufacturing yields and improve our ability to produce sufficient quantities of lcos sets to meet future quantity demands from lg electronics and other customers and prospective customers 
the potential negative impact upon our results of operations that could be caused by continued or additional difficulties in manufacturing our lcos sets are described under risk factors in item a 
we continued to install manufacturing and related equipment in the south korean facility and we actively hired personnel throughout we are currently training our operators and supervisors in key processes and equipment familiarization 
we believe that this is making our overall production transition more efficient and reducing the chances of our incurring more unexpected delays in our manufacturing process 
the process is now substantially complete for the initial production ramp up 
we will continue to hire and train employees as manufacturing volumes increase  although we cannot provide any assurances of increases in manufacturing volumes 
in our manufacturing facilities  we perform product testing of our lcos sets  analyze the results and take actions to refine the manufacturing process and enhance product design 
we have developed statistical quality control procedures for our manufacturing process 
we believe that these current arrangements provide us with strong quality controls and effectively protect our proprietary technology in our products 
we currently obtain silicon backplanes  a vital component in our lcos sets  from taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  located in taiwan 
we are working to qualify a second supply source for our silicon backplanes 
historically  the supply of silicon backplanes from suppliers fluctuates and we may be subject to problems of availability  although we have not experienced any such problems to date 
other key components include coated glass and flex circuitry 
we currently obtain glass from unaxis optics  located in liechtenstein 
our flex circuits are obtained from multiple sources located in asia and the united states 
we are subject to some supply fluctuations and there may be availability problems that arise 
in all cases  we are attempting to find and qualify additional supply sources to mitigate supply risk  but this process is not complete 
we do not currently have any long term agreements with any of our suppliers 
any termination of a relationship with one or more of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our anticipated commitments to customers while we identify and qualify replacement manufacturers or sources of supply 
we could become dependent on a manufacturer for components of our lcos sets and any termination of our relationship with such a manufacturer could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products 
competition microdisplays are a subset of the display market including television and video display 
this display market subset consists of reflective microdisplays produced on silicon backplanes  transmissive microdisplays and emissive microdisplays 
companies competing in the reflective microdisplay market include sony  jvc  aurora  syntax brillian  and elcos 
these companies are all producing different forms of a liquid crystal display on a silicon backplane 
sony and jvc have high definition televisions incorporating the lcos technology in the consumer market 
a major competitor in the reflective microdisplay market  although not using liquid crystals in the display  is texas instruments  which is producing a micro mechanical structure of moving mirrors on a silicon backplane  a technology known as digital light processing  or dlp 
texas instruments has had significant success selling its dlp products to its customers in the rear projection television market and the business front projector market 
rapid and significant technological advances have characterized the microdisplay market 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any such technological advances or that we will have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies  products or processes 
although we believe that our displays have specifications and capabilities  which equal or exceed that of commercially available lcd  cathode ray tube crt and dlp based display products  the manufacturers of these products may develop further improvements of their existing technology that would eliminate or diminish our anticipated advantage 
in addition  numerous competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we have 
we may also face an aggressive  well financed competitive response that may include misappropriation of our intellectual property or predatory pricing 
patents and intellectual property our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies 
we currently have five us patents and we have other us and international patent applications pending 
the scope of the issued patents includes physical structure design of the metal layers used for light blocking in the silicon die or backplane  several silicon die or backplane circuitry designs  and a dual panel system design 
the applications are in the area of light engine level system enhancements and drive circuitry concepts 
our currently issued patents will all expire between and there can be no assurance respecting the degree of protection offered by these patents or as to the likelihood that pending patents will be issued 
our competitors  in both the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell our products or intentionally infringe upon our patents 
we may undertake to expand our intellectual property portfolio by continuing to file new patent applications and or by purchasing or licensing existing patents currently owned by other companies 
the defense and prosecution of patent suits is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
this can be particularly true in foreign countries 
in addition  there is an inherent unpredictability regarding obtaining and enforcing patents in foreign countries 
an adverse outcome in the defense of a patent suit could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require us to cease selling our products 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology and there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary technology 
to protect our rights in these areas  we require all employees and technology consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
to date  we have no experience in enforcing our confidentiality agreements 
research and development we incurred research and development expenses of approximately  in   in and  in research and development expenses are those costs incurred for personnel and experimental materials for the design and development of new products 
we believe that the development of new products will be required to allow us to compete effectively and to achieve greater revenues than we have derived to date 
as of december   we had nine employees in the us whose significant duties included research and development 
we intend to continue our product development programs  focusing on increasing the display specifications including resolution  color and manufacturing processes 
we believe that such developments will be required to exploit future markets 
employees as of december   we had thirty one full time employees and one part time accounting contractor located in california 
full time employment is divided among three functional areas with nine in research and development  eight in manufacturing and fourteen in management finance administration 
as of december   we had eight full time employees classified as management finance administration in south korea 
we have nine engineers and seventy four employees classified as manufacturing in south korea 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors we are confronted by serious liquidity concerns 
as of the date hereof  we have limited financial resources 
our operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash and will continue to require substantial amounts of capital in the future 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make significant investments essential to our ability to operate profitably  including further investments in research and development  equipment  facilities and production activities 
taking into account our current financial condition  we will require significant additional financing to satisfy our increasing working capital requirements in our financial condition and liquidity have been strongly assisted through private sales of our common shares both registered and unregistered  convertible note financing  and the payment of exercise prices on our warrants and options 
we have no assurance that outstanding stock options and warrants will be exercised in the future 
reliance on private equity purchase agreements and public offerings and exercises of derivative securities to finance our future operations entails the additional risks of our inability to sell our common shares or other securities and an insufficient number of warrants being exercised owing to the prevailing market prices of our underlying common shares 
in the event that we are unable to obtain further financing on satisfactory terms  or at all  or we are unable to generate sales sufficient to offset our costs  or if our costs of development and operations are greater than we anticipate  we may be unable to increase the size of our business at the rate desired or may be required to delay  reduce  or cease certain or all of our operations  any of which could materially harm our business and financial results 
certain of the holders of the senior secured convertible notes issued by us in november have made claims of default 
as previously disclosed in our current report on form k  filed december   holders of  principal amount of our senior secured convertible notes have alleged that we have defaulted in the payment of the installment of interest due november  on these notes 
in addition  one of these holders  who holds  principal amount of the senior secured convertible notes  has alleged that we have defaulted in our failure to maintain the effectiveness of registration statement on form s pertaining to the senior secured convertible notes registration no 
in such manner as to permit such holder to sell its shares pursuant to that registration statement 
that holder of  principal amount of the senior secured convertible notes  as previously disclosed in our current report on form k  filed february   has also alleged that we have defaulted under the terms of the senior convertible notes by entering into certain types of debt financing transactions 
as a consequence of these alleged defaults  these holders have demanded the immediate redemption of the principal amount of their senior secured convertible notes plus a redemption premium of  to each of them 
we do not believe that we have defaulted in the payment of interest on the senior secured convertible notes  and we believe that the registration statement has remained effective  that we have not entered into any debt financing transactions that would constitute a breach or failure in any material respect  and that we are otherwise in compliance with the relevant provisions of the senior secured convertible notes 
at this date  we cannot predict what actions  if any  will be undertaken by any of the holders of the senior secured convertible notes  but we will contest any adverse actions as we do not believe that we have committed any defaults under the terms of the senior secured convertible notes 
we are currently manufacturing and shipping our lcos sets in limited commercial quantities  but difficulties in manufacturing our products in larger quantities will make it difficult to meet customer demands and our operating results could be significantly harmed by such difficulties 
we have recently experienced difficulties in manufacturing our lcos sets principally due to problems that we have experienced in certain specific portions of our manufacturing process  which  until january  were being carried out in our production facility in california 
we have relocated these portions of our manufacturing process to our production facility in south korea  where we have highly qualified personnel and a new facility designed to our specifications 
see status of business with lg electronics  inc contained in item for a more detailed discussion of manufacturing difficulties that we have experienced 
furthermore  by having manufacturing take place in one location  we expect to be able to maintain a higher level of quality controls over our lcos set production 
however  because the manufacture of our lcos sets involves highly complex processes and technical problems may continue to arise as we manufacture our lcos sets  we cannot assure satisfactory manufacturing yields or that we will be able to adequately ramp up volume production of our lcos sets 
current purchase orders  including our agreement with lg electronics  and anticipated future purchase orders  which we cannot assure  will require us to produce greater quantities of our lcos sets than we have produced in the past 
if future manufacturing yields do not improve or if we incur unanticipated future problems in production of our lcos sets  it will significantly harm our business and operating results because we will have already incurred the costs for the materials used in the lcos set manufacturing process as well as the costs of operating our south korean manufacturing facility 
unanticipated further problems in manufacturing our lcos sets could also cause production delays that could lead our current and prospective customers to seek other sources  which would negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase as the sophistication of our lcos sets increases  and such complexities may lend to similar difficulties that could harm our business and operating results 
although we believe that we will be able to mass produce our lcos sets  other companies  including some with substantially greater resources than us  have found great difficulty or failed to do so 
we do not have reliable information about why other companies have failed to manufacture similar liquid crystal microdisplays and can therefore make no assurances that we will not encounter similar problems 
we currently obtain silicon backplanes  a vital component in our microdisplays  from the far east 
some asian countries are subject to earthquakes  typhoons or political instability 
unless we obtain an alternative source  any disruption or termination of our silicon manufacturing source s operation in taiwan or air transportation with the far east could significantly harm our operations 
our lcos sets are assembled by combining the silicon backplanes with electronic components 
the design and manufacture of lcos sets are highly complex processes that are sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  variations in temperature and humidity  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we have built and equipped a manufacturing plant in south korea where we currently manufacture our lcos sets in limited quantities 
we believe that these current arrangements provide us with strong quality controls and effectively protect our proprietary technology in our products  but the risks discussed above associated with the highly complex processes of manufacturing these liquid crystal microdisplays remain applicable 
although we have commenced producing products in our manufacturing facility in south korea  which serves as our principal facility for manufacturing our microdisplay products  we may encounter difficulties in conducting our manufacturing operations and difficulties in maintaining our quality controls over the manufacturing and production processes  any of which would be likely to cause significant harm to our business 
our decision to locate our principal manufacturing operations in south korea may cause us to encounter one or more potential problems that could harm our business 
these potential problems could arise in connection with conducting our manufacturing operations at the facility in south korea 
as a result of cultural or language differences  problems may arise in the training of  or communications with  our employees  such as misunderstandings or the creation of inefficiencies in our operations 
the geographic separation between our corporate offices in the united states and our principal manufacturing operation in south korea could result in managerial or supervisory problems  which could lead to decreased quality controls and a subsequent material harm to our business 
we are largely dependent on one customer  lg electronics  for our future revenues  and failure to expand our customer base or receive additional orders from our existing customer base will make us vulnerable to substantial loss of potential revenues 
in  most of our revenue was derived from lg electronics 
based upon our agreement with lg electronics  it is likely that a substantial percentage of our anticipated future revenues will be derived from lg electronics as well 
if we cannot diversify our customer base or derive increased revenues through additional purchase orders and product deliveries from customers other than lg electronics  and therefore remain primarily reliant on only one customer for a substantial percentage of our revenues  we will be vulnerable to a substantial decline in anticipated revenues if we lose lg electronics as a customer for any reason or if lg electronics were to otherwise reduce  delay or cancel its orders 
any such events could cause a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition and the value of our common shares could decline substantially 
our ability to retain and receive additional purchase orders from our current customers and to attract and receive purchase orders from prospective customers may depend upon the acceptance of lg electronics products in the consumer marketplace 
if lg electronics television products incorporating our lcos technology are not commercially successful  demand for our products from our current and prospective customers may not materialize  which could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition 
we are the subject of an investigation by the staff of the sec regarding the circumstances surrounding our filing of certain consents of the independent registered accounting firm bdo seidman  llp without requisite authorization 
we have been advised by the staff of the sec that it is conducting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding our filing of consents of the independent registered accounting firm bdo seidman  llp  without requisite authorization  which consents were filed as exhibit to amendments to our registration statements on form s nos 
and filed with the sec on july  the consents would have allowed us to incorporate by reference in each of the prospectuses constituting a part of the above referenced registration statements our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and our current independent registered accounting firm  odenberg  ullakko  muranishi co 
llp oum has since provided us with a new report with respect to each of the three years ended december  and we were not requested to amend or restate the financial statements contained in our annual reports on form k for any of the three fiscal years ended december  in connection with the issuance of oum s new report 
we have been cooperating and intend to continue to cooperate with the sec in connection with this matter 
in addition  the audit committee of our board of directors has concluded a review and investigation of these matters 
as of this date  we cannot determine whether we or our management will be adversely affected by this inquiry 
see certain developments under item for further information concerning the factual circumstances underlying the sec investigation and the audit committee investigation and report with respect to this matter 
we may be subject to lawsuits relating to our use of a registration statement that did not contain an authorized consent of bdo seidman llp 
as disclosed under certain developments under item  we filed  as part of amendment numbers and to a registration statement file no 
registering shares for resale by certain selling shareholders the financing registration statement and as part of amendment numbers and to a shelf registration statement file no 
 an unauthorized consent of bdo seidman to incorporate by reference their report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
although we received the requisite authorized consents from bdo seidman to the incorporation by reference of their report on the consolidated financial statements into these registration statements when initially filed and subsequent amendments thereto and bdo seidman has not withdrawn these subsequent consents  we did not receive the requisite authorization from bdo seidman to file its consent as an exhibit to the penultimate and final amendments to the registration statement before it was declared effective 
these amendments were filed with the sec on july  subsequently  our current independent registered public accountants  oum  re audited our consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and oum has given its consent to incorporate by reference into the registration statement the financial statements for and and its report related to those financial statements 
following the filing in july of amendment number to the financing registration statement and amendment number to the shelf registration statement  which contained the unauthorized consents referred to above  the staff of the sec declared both of the registration statements effective 
in august  we filed post effective amendments number to both of these registration statements those post effective amendments were subsequently withdrawn and replaced by additional post effective amendments  which disclosed the filing of the unauthorized consents 
because both registration statements were used to sell common shares after the staff of the sec declared the registration statements effective  it is conceivable that there may be litigation against us or our officers or directors under section of the securities act 
although we do not believe that the filing of an invalid consent constitutes a materially misleading statement or an omission to disclose a material fact within the meaning of section of the securities act  a contrary determination could result in a liability for us 
at present  we are unable to ascertain the exact amount of damages  if any  to which we could potentially be subject under a section claim instituted by any persons who directly purchased shares pursuant to those registration statements 
furthermore  at this date  we cannot ascertain the amount of damages  if any  for which we could be liable for claims instituted by any subsequent purchasers who could trace the shares purchased by them to those registration statements 
in august  we sold  common shares to three institutional purchasers for per share pursuant to the shelf registration statement referenced herein 
each of those investors has since represented to us in writing  in connection with a separate transaction  that they have disposed of all of those shares 
one of those institutional investors has represented to us that it sold those shares at a sale price at or higher than its purchase price from us 
we believe  based upon discussions with the other two investors  that they sold their shares at a sale price of not lower than per share 
therefore  we believe that our maximum damages pursuant to section claims from direct purchasers  which we would fully contest  would be  or the difference between the two investors purchase price and lowest believed resale price  multiplied by the  shares that they purchased and then resold 
in addition to any damage claims  which may be material to our financial condition  any lawsuit alleging securities law violations could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources 
any such lawsuit could also result in further volatility in the market price of our common shares 
nothing set forth in the foregoing statement constitutes an express or implied admission by us of any liability under section of the securities act or otherwise 
the obligations arising from our senior secured convertible notes restrict our future financing alternatives and may result in financial difficulties for us in the future 
the senior secured convertible notes issued in november bear a rate of interest per annum and are not prepayable  in whole or in part  prior to their maturity on november  therefore  we do not have the ability to refinance the senior secured convertible notes with debt obligations bearing more favorable terms to us or out of the proceeds of an equity financing until their maturity date 
although we do have the right to convert the senior secured convertible notes into our common shares in the event that our common shares trade at or above of the conversion price of the senior secured convertible notes for twenty consecutive trading days 
the last sale price of our common shares on march   was per share 
furthermore  the senior secured convertible notes are secured by virtually all of our assets  other than those located in south korea  and it may therefore be difficult for us to obtain future debt financing 
however  the terms of the senior secured convertible notes allow us to subordinate these notes to indebtedness to a bank or other institution where that indebtedness is secured by accounts receivable  contractual rights or inventory or similar financing 
if we default in meeting our obligations under the senior secured convertible notes  the indebtedness which they evidence may become immediately due and payable  and the holders of the senior secured convertible notes may be entitled to foreclose on any of our assets securing the notes 
as noted earlier  certain of the holders of our senior secured convertible notes have alleged that we have defaulted in meeting our obligations and have demanded the immediate repayment of principal and liquidated damages 
in the event these holders pursue their claims  and a court determines that we have defaulted in our obligations  we will have to seek financing from third parties to satisfy the holder s claims 
the senior secured convertible notes are convertible into our common shares and the issuance of such shares including any shares issued in payment of interest on such notes may have a dilutive effect on the value of our outstanding common shares 
we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future and therefore cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
we have incurred losses to date and have experienced cash shortages 
for the year ended december   we incurred net losses of approximately million 
in addition  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we expect additional losses as we continue spending for commercial scale production and other business activities as well as further research and development of our products 
as a result  we will need to generate substantial sales to support our costs of doing business before we can begin to recoup our operating losses and accumulated deficit and achieve profitability 
we are subject to lengthy development periods and product acceptance cycles  which may significantly harm our business 
our business model requires us to develop microdisplays that perform better than existing technologies  manufacture our lcos sets in bulk  and sell the resulting lcos sets to oems that will then incorporate them into their products 
oems make the determination during their product development programs whether to incorporate our lcos sets and or display units in their products 
this requires us to invest significant amounts of time and capital in designing our lcos sets before we can be assured that we will generate any significant sales to our customers or even recover our investment 
if we fail to recover our investment in the lcos sets  it could seriously harm our financial condition 
in addition  the acceptance of new technologies developed by our competitors could limit the time period that our products may be demanded by our customers 
we incur substantial operational and research and development costs in connection with products and technologies that may not be successful 
we currently have full time engineering and full time manufacturing personnel based in california working on microdisplays 
we currently have nine full time engineering and full time manufacturing personnel based in south korea 
this staffing creates significant operational and research and development costs that may not be recouped 
even if our current lcos sets become accepted and or successful  we must continue to employ and may increase in number  our engineering and manufacturing personnel to develop future generations of our microdisplays because of the rapid technological changes in our industry 
as a result  we expect to continue incurring significant operational and research and development costs 
geopolitical conditions or potential military conflicts between allies  the united states and south korea  and north korea may negatively impact our business 
we commenced producing products in our principal manufacturing operations in south korea during the second quarter of  and our largest customer  lg electronics  resides in south korea 
south korea and north korea are technically at war with each other  despite the mutually agreed upon existence of the demilitarized zone and the relative absence of physical conflict for several decades 
any escalation in the existing conflict between these countries or any commencement  or perceived commencement of a military conflict between the united states and north korea  may limit our ability to effectively operate our manufacturing facility in south korea and also may substantially limit our ability to sell products into south korea because of the negative economic  physical or other destructive impact that such a conflict could have on our most important customer 
any such disruptions to our manufacturing operations and or ability to consummate sales to a substantial customer could adversely affect the development of our business and our financial condition 
if the high definition television market does not continue to develop and if other potential markets for our products do not materialize  then our business will likely be significantly harmed 
high definition television programming has only recently become available to consumers  and widespread market acceptance  although anticipated  is uncertain at this time 
the market demand for high definition televisions is considered contingent upon widespread acceptance of high definition television programming 
our current sales and marketing efforts are focused on oems of high definition televisions and oems of light engines designed for incorporation into high definition televisions 
therefore  if the market for high definition televisions does not continue to grow and develop  then we will have significant difficulty selling our products  which will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
various potential target markets for our products  including projectors  monitors  and portable microdisplays  are uncertain and may be slow to develop 
in addition  companies in those markets could utilize competing technologies 
for us to succeed in selling our products into these potential markets we must offer end product manufacturers higher quality and less expensive microdisplay products than our competitors  and the manufacturers themselves will also have to develop commercially successful products using our products 
in the event that we attempt to market and sell our products into these potential target markets  if we are not able to succeed in selling our products into these potential markets  then our results of operations and overall business may be negatively affected 
if our products do not become widely accepted by our customers or the end users  our business could be significantly harmed 
our lcos sets may not be accepted by a widespread market 
even if we successfully obtain customer orders  our customers may determine not to introduce or may terminate products utilizing the technology for a variety of reasons  including the following superior technologies developed by our competitors  price considerations  and lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional purchase orders from our current or prospective customers  or  if we do  that such orders will generate significant revenues 
even though in the past we have received purchase orders for our lcos sets and or display units from lg electronics and from certain chinese and taiwanese oems and may receive additional purchase orders from prospective customers  sales to manufacturers in the electronics industry are subject to severe competitive pressures  rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
in addition  purchase orders received from our customers other than lg electronics are for limited quantities of our products 
customers may  at any time  cancel purchase orders or commitments or reduce or delay orders  thereby increasing our inventory and overhead risks 
therefore  despite the purchase orders received from current customers and other purchase orders that we may receive from prospective customers  we cannot assure you that these agreements will result in significant revenues to us 
if our customers products are not successful  our business would be materially harmed 
we do not currently sell any products to end users 
instead  we design and manufacture various product solutions that our customers ie  oems may incorporate into their products 
as a result  our success depends almost entirely upon the widespread market acceptance of our customers products 
any significant absence of  or slowdown in the demand for our customers products would materially harm our business 
our dependence on the success of the products of our customers exposes us to a variety of risks  including our need to do the following maintain customer satisfaction with our design and manufacturing services  match our design and manufacturing capacity with customer demand and maintain satisfactory delivery schedules  anticipate customer order patterns  changes in order mix  and the level and timing of orders that we can meet  and adjust to the cyclical nature of the industries and markets we serve 
our failure to address these risks may cause us to lose sales or for sales to decline 
the high definition television industry is highly competitive  which may result in lost sales or lower gross margins 
we serve the highly competitive high definition television industry that is characterized by price erosion  rapid technological change and competition from major domestic and international companies 
this intense competition could result in downward pricing pressures  lower sales  reduced margins and lower market share 
companies competing in the lcos microdisplay market include sony and jvc  although we presently believe that sony has developed lcos microdisplays for its own use and not for sale to other oem s 
a major competitor of ours in the reflective microdisplay market is texas instruments  which  rather than using liquid crystals in the display  is producing a micro mechanical structure of moving mirrors on a silicon backplane  a technology known as digital light processing  or dlp 
texas instruments has had significant success selling its dlp products to its customers in the business front projector market and the rear projection high definition television market 
some of our competitors  including texas instruments  sony  and jvc  have greater market recognition  larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we possess 
as a result  they may be able to introduce new products and respond to customer requirements more quickly and effectively than we can 
rapid and significant technological advances have characterized the microdisplay market 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect any significant technological advances or that we will have sufficient funds to invest in new technologies or products or processes 
although we believe that our displays have specifications and capabilities  which equal or exceed that of commercially available lcd  cathode ray tube crt and dlp based display products  the manufacturers of these products may develop further improvements of their existing technology that would eliminate or diminish our anticipated advantage 
the acceptance of our lcos sets and or display units will be dependent upon the pricing  quality  reliability and useful life of these products compared to competing technologies  as to which there can be no assurance 
our competitive position also may suffer if one or more of our customers decide to design and manufacture their own microdisplay products  to contract with our competitors  or to use alternative technologies 
in addition  customers in the television manufacturing industry typically develop a second source 
second source suppliers may win an increasing share of our customer s product demands 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  both within and outside our control 
these factors include the following our success in designing and manufacturing new display technologies  our ability to address the needs of customers  the quality  performance  reliability  features  ease of use  pricing  and diversity of our display products  foreign currency fluctuations  which may cause a foreign competitor s products to be priced significantly lower than our displays  the quality of our customer services  the efficiency of our production sources  and the rate at which customers incorporate our displays into their own products  and products or technologies introduced by our competitors 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the united states dollar and foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and profitability 
a portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies  including the korean won and the euro 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our costs of good sold and operating margins  and could result in exchange losses 
we cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability 
from time to time  we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  although we have not engaged in any such hedging activities to date 
however  we cannot offer assurance that any hedging technique we may implement will be effective 
if it is not effective  we may experience reduced operating margins 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations 
our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future  which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors that cause our operating results to fluctuate include the following introductions of displays and market acceptance of new generations of displays  timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders  changes in our cost structure  availability of labor and components  pricing and availability of competitive products and services  the timing of orders  the volume of orders relative to the capacity we can contract to produce  evolution in the life cycles of customers products  and changes or anticipated changes in economic conditions 
the market price of our common shares is highly volatile 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile  reflecting among other things reported losses  receipts of additional financing and investors perceptions about our business prospects 
some research has shown that similar volatility in other companies correlates with class action securities lawsuits although to date we have not been a defendant in any such lawsuit 
the trading price of our common shares in the future could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including the following quarterly variations in our operating results  actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations or new product developments by us or our competitors  public announcements regarding our business developments  changes in analysts estimates of our financial performance  sales of large numbers of our common shares by our shareholders  general conditions in the electronics industry  and worldwide economic and financial conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations and other factors may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
by further increasing the number of our common shares that may be sold into the market  any future offerings of our common shares  or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares  could cause the market price of our common shares to decrease significantly  even if our business operations are performing well 
the total number of common shares included in the post effective amendment no 
to form s registration statement that we filed with the sec on february  registration number  principally relating to the november financing  the  common shares included in the post effective amendment no 
to form s shelf registration statement filed by us with the sec on february  registration number and  common shares included the form s registration statement filed by us with the sec on february  registration number  represents approximately of the total number of our common shares that were issued and outstanding as of december  sales of these shares into the public market  or the perception that future sales of these common shares could occur  might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares in the near future 
furthermore  market perceptions regarding the likelihood that we will be required to issue and sell additional common shares in the near future to fund our ongoing operations  thereby diluting the ownership interests of current owners of our common shares  could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
our common shares may not be liquid 
our common shares are currently traded on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our shareholders may find that it is more difficult to sell our common shares than shares that are listed on the nasdaq national market or new york stock exchange 
the trading volume of our common shares has historically been adversely affected by their limited marketability  but such volume has increased significantly in recent periods 
nevertheless  any substantial sales of our common shares may result in a material reduction in their market price  reflecting the volatility of the trading market for our common shares 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to compete could be harmed 
our development and operations depend substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and qualified technical personnel 
our products require sophisticated production  research and development and technical support 
the competition for qualified management and technical personnel is intense 
the loss of services of one or more of our key employees or the inability to add key personnel could have a material adverse affect on us  particularly since currently we do not have any insurance policies in place to cover that contingency 
our success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  marketing  manufacturing  financial and other key management personnel 
we face intense competition for the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of our products and technology 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain such personnel or not incur significant costs in order to do so 
our future success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our registered intellectual property 
we believe that our success depends in part on protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements from our employees  consultants and advisors and other contractual provisions  to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property from use by third parties  our ability to compete in the industry will be harmed 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult  however 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  we face the following risks pending patent applications may not be issued  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may independently develop similar technology or design around any patents issued to us  breach of confidentiality agreements  intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property  and effective protection of intellectual property rights may be limited or unavailable in some foreign countries  such as china  in which we may operate 
specifically  although we consider the following unlikely because of the complex technological structure of our products  one or more of our current or prospective chinese  korean or taiwanese customers  or their respective employees or other persons including our competitors  that have or gain access to our products for testing purposes  may seek to misappropriate or improperly convert to their own use our intellectual property and a lack of adequate remedies and impartiality under the chinese  korean and other foreign legal systems may adversely impact our ability to protect our intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that we will have adequate remedies in the event any of the foregoing materializes 
failure to protect our intellectual property would limit our ability to produce and market our products in the future  which would materially adversely affect our revenues generated by the sale of such products 
in addition  third parties could assert that our products and technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
as a result  we may become subject to future patent infringement claims or litigation  the defense of which is costly  time consuming and diverts the attention of management and other personnel 
the material weaknesses identified by our management and our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our material internal control systems  processes and procedures may have a materially negative impact on our business 
in accordance with the rules prescribed by the sec and the sarbanes oxley act of  we must periodically review and test our material internal control systems  processes and procedures to ensure compliance 
during our preparation of our form k annual report for the year ended december   our management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified several material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 
although these material weaknesses did not result in a misstatement of our financial results  they relate closely to assuring the fulfillment of critical components of the financial reporting functions of our business 
as of this date  the material weaknesses identified include the fact that our company does not have a full time chief financial officer 
the company does not currently have a chief financial officer to work with the chief executive officer and chief operating officer in overseeing and monitoring complex and significant transactions in order to provide reasonable assurance that such transactions are reflected accurately and fairly in the financial statements  although we employ a part time controller to assist in the performance of the foregoing functions 
furthermore  our audit committee does not have a member who is deemed a financial expert as defined by the rules promulgated by the sec  although a member of our audit committee has the level of financial sophistication that the nasdaq s rules require 
additionally  the company does not have a corporate governance or disclosure committee  has inadequate controls and procedures over inventory  lacks information technology controls and procedures that would likely prevent unauthorized access to accounting and financial systems  does not have effective internal controls over financial reporting at our wholly owned subsidiary in south korea  does not maintain formal accounting policies and procedures to allow the accounting function to adequately analyze transactions and determine correct accounting under gaap  and does not have formal procedures to prevent the filing of registration statements with the sec without the required accountant s consent 
we may therefore need to incur significant additional expenses to achieve compliance and we may incur other costs in connection with regulatory enforcement actions  any of which could negatively impact our business 
political  economic and regulatory risks associated with international operations may limit our ability to do business abroad 
a substantial number of our customers  manufacturers and suppliers are located outside of the united states  principally in the far east 
our international operations are subject to political and economic conditions abroad  and protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or foreign countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export or import compliance laws  or other trade policies  any of which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture or sell displays in foreign markets and to purchase materials or equipment from foreign suppliers 
certain of our current purchase order agreements with customers are governed by foreign law and therefore are subject to uncertainty with regard to their enforceability 
we do not pay cash dividends 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common shares and do not anticipate that we will pay cash dividends in the near future 
moreover  under the terms of the november financing  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends while the senior secured convertible notes issued in the november financing remain outstanding 
instead  we intend to apply any future earnings to the expansion and development of our business

item description of property our headquarters are located at five hamilton landing  suite  novato  california 
our premises  which were designed and built out to our specifications  encompass our corporate offices  quality assurance and testing facilities and optics laboratories 
the facility aggregates  square feet and the lease continues through august we also leased clean room space in california where we manufactured components of our lcos sets in limited quantities through the end of we will continue to lease a smaller amount of space at this same facility for research and development purposes 
in september  we entered into a fifty year term lease with the gyeongnam provincial government for acres of undeveloped land in jinsa  gyeongnam province in south korea 
we leased the land for the purpose of constructing a state of the art manufacturing facility with the anticipated capacity to meet mass production scale demand from our customers and prospective customers 
we have received a land lease payment exemption because the land has been designated a free economic zone by the south korean national government and the south korean government also certified us as a high technology company 
under our agreement with the gyeongnam provincial government we could lose our land lease payment exemption in the event that we lose our high technology certification 
we completed construction of our south korean manufacturing facility in january the south korean facility approximately  sq 
feet has commenced to serve as our central commercial manufacturing base 
for a more detailed discussion of our south korean manufacturing facility  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that our current facilities are adequate to fulfill our business commitments for the immediate foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings we are not currently involved in any material legal proceedings 
we are a party to routine claims and lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of such ordinary course proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe that the resolution of any future ordinary course matters individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  we have received notices alleging events of default under the terms of the senior secured convertible notes but for which we are not yet subject to legal proceedings which we are contesting as more fully described under item management s discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders there were no matters submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal part ii item market for common equity and related stockholders matters trading in our common shares has been conducted on the nasdaq smallcap market since may   under the symbol hdtv 
because we are traded on the smallcap market  our securities may be less liquid  receive less coverage by security analysts and news media and generate lower prices than might otherwise be obtained 
the following table sets forth  for the calendar quarters indicated  the range of high and low quotations for our common shares  as reported by commodity systems  inc hdtv common shares fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the quotations listed above reflect inter dealer prices  without retail mark up  markdown or commission and may not represent actual transactions 
as of march   there were approximately holders of record of our common shares and the closing price per share was as reported on the nasdaq smallcap market 
the common shares represent the only class of securities outstanding as of the date of this filing 
to date  we have not paid a dividend on our common shares 
the payment of future dividends is subject to our earnings and financial position and such other factors  including contractual restrictions  as the board of directors may deem relevant 
under the terms of the financing completed on november  november financing  which is more fully described under item overview  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends while the senior secured convertible notes issued in the november financing remain outstanding 
it is therefore unlikely that dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future 
sales of unregistered securities in mid january  we issued and sold  of our common shares in a private placement to three institutional investors 
the purchase price of the common shares was per share 
we received approximately million in gross proceeds  before issuance costs  from the sale of these shares 
in october  we closed a million private placement of our common shares and warrants to purchase our common shares with certain institutional and other investors 
this transaction included the sale of  common shares at a purchase price of per share and warrants to purchase  common shares with an exercise price of per share exercisable within five years from the date of issuance 
we received million in gross proceeds from this transaction 
on november   we issued senior secured convertible notes totaling  the notes are convertible into our common shares at the conversion price of per share 
interest payable under the notes at per year may be paid in our common shares  at our option if certain conditions are met  at a conversion price that will be calculated at the end of each quarterly interest period while the senior secured convertible notes are outstanding 
in october  we issued  common shares upon the exercise of a warrant 
the purchase price was per share and total cash received was none of the above securities transactions involved any underwriters 
all of the purchasers of our securities in the above described securities transactions were accredited investors within the meaning of rule under regulation d of the securities act of  as amended the act and  accordingly  all of these transactions were exempt from registration under the act by reason of section thereof or regulation d

overview we are in the business of manufacturing high resolution lcos microdisplays 
our current customers and prospective customers are original equipment manufacturers oems engaged in the businesses of manufacturing high definition televisions or manufacturing light engines for incorporation into high definition televisions 
our products are also suitable for incorporation into other potential display applications including rear projection computer monitors  wireless communication devices  portable games and digital assistants  although we are not currently working with oems on any of these products 
status of business with lg electronics  inc in july  we entered into an agreement with lg electronics see exhibit to our annual report on form k a filed with the sec on december   providing for us to sell our t lcos sets to lg electronics 
our supply agreement with lg electronics provides that we will be their exclusive supplier of three chip lcos microdisplay products for twelve months beginning from the date that we commenced shipments under that agreement 
furthermore  our agreement provides that lg electronics will have the exclusive right in south korea to purchase t microdisplay products from us for the twelve months beginning from the date that we commenced shipments under that agreement 
in july  we commenced delivering a limited quantity of commercial production lcos sets to lg electronics 
under the july agreement  lg electronics agreed to purchase from us a minimum of  lcos sets during an initial six month delivery period  which was originally scheduled to commence in january  subject to lg electronics completion of pre production requirements 
our july product delivery to lg electronics included a smaller quantity of lcos sets than was originally contemplated under the july agreement for the first delivery month 
we delivered those lcos sets in july based upon our expectation that in the immediate future we would receive a firm purchase order from lg electronics 
in august  we received a firm purchase order from lg electronics for its purchase from us of an aggregate minimum quantity of  lcos sets for the period july through december in october  we publicly announced that we had received the formal written qualification letter from lg electronics stating that we have met certain agreed upon technical specifications which had been the subject of prior informal approval in july 
we later agreed with lg electronics to move the initial six month delivery period to november through april we subsequently agreed with lg electronics  through a series of communications  that the initial purchase order for  lcos sets may be filled over a period of time that will extend beyond april we currently expect that the initial order for  lcos sets could be filled during the summer of this revised schedule has been based primarily upon changing expectations about our production output capacity and will allow us to conduct a focused ramp up of our lcos set production in south korea 
although we have been delivering a limited quantity of production lcos sets to lg electronics since july  our delivery ramp up has been slower than expected due to lg electronics product specification changes and problems that we have experienced in ramping up our manufacturing volumes 
these manufacturing problems have been principally attributable to external variables in the manufacturing environment including temperature  humidity and dust particle presence 
the manufacturing problems have occurred during the alignment coating  glue application and cell lamination portions of our manufacturing process  which are highly susceptible to those external variables 
until recently  those portions of the manufacturing process were being carried out in our production facility in california 
we have attempted to address our manufacturing problems by recently relocating these portions of our manufacturing process to our production facility in south korea  where we believe that the combination of a new facility designed to our specifications and highly qualified personnel provides us with more exacting controls over the external variables that can impact our manufacturing process 
at our manufacturing facility in south korea  in test and production runs  while we are continuing to experience certain of the production problems attributable to external variables specified above  we believe that we will be able to more fully address and alleviate those problems in coming months 
our entire manufacturing operations are now conducted at the facility in south korea 
the transfer of those specific portions of the process caused a delay in manufacturing operations while production equipment was physically transferred from california to south korea and south korean employees are being trained to use that equipment 
the final phase of this transition is occurring during the first quarter of however  we believe that having manufacturing take place in one location will allow us to maintain a higher level of quality controls over lcos set production  which we expect will increase our long term manufacturing yields and improve our ability to produce sufficient quantities of lcos sets to meet future quantity demands from lg electronics and other customers and prospective customers 
the potential negative impact upon our results of operations that could be caused by additional difficulties in manufacturing our lcos sets are described under risk factors item a 
lg electronics commenced an initial consumer market rollout in australia of a limited quantity of inch lcos televisions incorporating our lcos sets during the first quarter of lg electronics has also announced that it intends lcos product rollouts into the south korean consumer market in the near future 
lg electronics recently communicated to its distributors that it has postponed its plans to introduce its and lcos televisions into the us marketplace 
lg has attributed this postponement to uncertainty regarding the timetable for the availability of sufficiently large supplies of our lcos sets to enable a significant product launch 
although lg electronics has advised us that it is maintaining future plans for expansion into the united states and other markets  there can be no assurances as to the timing of those rollouts 
we believe that delays in lg electronics initial product rollouts have been based upon revisions to our delivery schedule and our problems in ramping up production that have occurred over time 
in  a substantial percentage of our product deliveries  which were in small quantities  were made to lg electronics 
based upon our agreement with lg electronics and our present expectations  it is likely that a substantial percentage of our anticipated future product deliveries in the first half of will be made to lg electronics as well 
in the event that we are unable to ramp up our delivery volumes to lg electronics by the end of july  we believe that it is reasonably likely that lg electronics may discontinue actively doing business with us 
the loss of lg electronics as a customer or any further delays in our delivery schedule to lg electronics could significantly harm our future sales and results of operations  and our substantial dependence on one customer is subject to risks set forth under risk factors in item a 
status of business in taiwan to date  we have delivered limited quantities of our t lcos sets to our taiwanese customer  thintek 
a substantial portion of these product deliveries occurred in thintek has ordered quantities sufficient for pilot programs and sample products  but not enough to enable them to launch mass production of lcos high definition televisions 
we have continuing business relationships with customers and prospective customers in taiwan  including thintek 
we made small shipments of t lcos sets to thintek during all four quarters of we are maintaining our plans to ship our products to thintek and prospective taiwanese customers in we cannot provide assurance concerning the quantities of our products that we will sell to thintek and other prospective customers in the future 
status of business in china to date  we have delivered limited quantities of our microdisplay products to our chinese customers 
a substantial portion of these product deliveries occurred in  with a smaller quantity delivered in the quantities of our products delivered to our chinese customers are sufficient only for engineering testing and pilot program purposes 
to date  our chinese customers have not ordered quantities of our products that would enable them to launch commercial sales of lcos high definition televisions 
we have continuing business relationships with customers and prospective customers in china 
current chinese prospective customers are at different stages in the development and product introduction processes  and their efforts are progressing at a slower rate than we originally anticipated 
one of our original chinese customers  skyworth  has commenced sales of televisions utilizing our display units incorporating our t lcos sets into the chinese educational market 
however  we do not intend to sell any additional display units incorporating our t lcos sets beyond what we currently have in inventory to skyworth 
they may elect to transition to products incorporating our t lcos sets 
we cannot provide assurance concerning the quantities of our products that we will sell to our chinese customers and prospective customers in the future 
market strategy for taiwan and china although our chinese and taiwanese customers progression from product prototyping to mass production has been far slower than we had anticipated  we remain positive about our business prospects in china and taiwan and the potential for china and taiwan to become large markets for us 
we currently believe that chinese and taiwanese television manufacturers tend to apply a market strategy of following the successful business models of global television manufacturing leaders  rather than acting as leaders themselves in terms of introducing new technologies to the marketplace 
we therefore believe that if the lcos technology gains greater acceptance in the high definition television marketplace  and if industry leaders  such as sony  jvc and lg electronics  present their lcos based televisions to the worldwide consumer markets in a prominent fashion  it will then be more likely that the chinese and taiwanese television manufacturers will follow these business models and ramp up their own lines of lcos high definition televisions 
we believe that our present course of continuing to transact business with major chinese and taiwanese television manufacturers is positioning us to be a leading lcos supplier in china and taiwan in the future 
other business development we are currently continuing to develop working relationships with prospective customers  located primarily in japan and other parts of the pacific rim region 
these prospective customers fall into two general categories television manufacturers and light engine suppliers 
we have provided samples of our lcos sets to certain of these prospective customers  but we do not have any formal agreements with these parties 
while we have made significant progress with respect to product integration and negotiating purchase orders with certain of these prospective customers  we cannot assure that we will receive any purchase orders binding on any of these companies for their purchase of our products in the near future 
even assuming that we receive purchase orders that are binding on the prospective customers  these orders and our sales to these customers and to our existing customers are subject to certain contingencies described under risk factors item a 
manufacturing of lcos sets we completed construction of our south korean manufacturing facility in january the south korean facility has commenced to serve as our central commercial manufacturing base 
the facility began producing products for commercial sale in limited quantities in the second quarter of the facility is designed with the capacity  on full employment  to produce up to  lcos sets per month 
the facility has been specially designed for expansion to a capacity of  lcos sets per month in several expansion phases 
we believe that the facility can be expanded in an efficient manner in the event that such expansion becomes necessary based upon increased or perceived increased demand for our products from our customers 
we are currently continuing to install additional manufacturing and related equipment in the facility 
we are currently training our operators and supervisors in key processes and equipment familiarization 
we recently completed the process of moving all of our manufacturing operations to south korea  which included physically moving all manufacturing equipment that remained in california as of the end of as part of the transition process  we experienced some manufacturing problems 
the manufacturing problems have occurred during the alignment coating  glue application and cell lamination portions of our manufacturing process  which are highly susceptible to those external variables 
until recently  those portions of the manufacturing process were being carried out in our production facility in california 
we have attempted to address our manufacturing problems by recently transitioning these portions of our manufacturing process to our production facility in south korea  where we believe that the combination of a new facility designed to our specifications and highly qualified personnel provides us with more exacting controls over the external variables that can impact our manufacturing process 
at our manufacturing facility in south korea  in test and production runs  we are continuing to experience certain of the production problems attributable to external variables specified above  but we believe that we will be able to more fully address and alleviate those problems in coming months 
while we cannot provide any assurances against unexpected delays  we believe that our transition approach constitutes an appropriate plan to deal with mass production readiness risks and to prepare ourselves to manage our manufacturing facility in south korea on a basis consistent with the anticipated demand for our products 
potential difficulties in transitioning our manufacturing process from california to south korea could have a material negative impact upon our results of operations as set forth under risk factors in item a 
see status of business with lg electronics  inc for a detailed discussion of manufacturing problems that we are experiencing and its effect upon our business 
business strategy we are currently offering one core product  our t lcos set  to our customers and prospective customers  all of whom are located primarily in asia 
our lcos set is comprised of three of our proprietary spatialight imagengine lcos microdisplays 
they are constructed with a silicon chip  a layer of liquid crystals and a glass cover plate in contrast to the more common construction of liquid crystals sandwiched between two glass plates 
our displays are also known as  and commonly referred to as  liquid crystal on silicon lcos  liquid crystal displays lcd  active matrix liquid crystal displays and spatial light modulators 
another former product that we no longer offer to our customers  except out of current inventory  is the display unit  which is comprised of an lcos set fitted onto a light engine 
our t lcos set  which is the only model we currently manufacture  has a pixels by pixels configuration 
we previously manufactured our t lcos set model  which had a pixels by pixels configuration 
we are exclusively focusing on manufacturing the t model of our lcos sets because we believe that the market demand for that higher resolution product will be significantly greater 
since we commenced delivering our products to our customers in the third quarter of  there has been a significant shift in the type of product that we have delivered to our customers based upon their demand 
the shift in deliveries has been in the direction of more lcos sets and less display units 
we believe that this shift is significant because we anticipate that lcos sets will be  in the long run  a higher margin product line and require less working capital than display units 
lcos sets yield less revenue than display units per unit sold 
in the beginning of  we made it our short term strategic objective to operate primarily as a seller of lcos sets and decrease our supply of display units to our customers  and our longer term strategic goal to exclusively sell lcos sets to our customers 
beginning in the first quarter of  we are actively offering only lcos sets to our customers and prospective customers 
our supply agreement with lg electronics is exclusively for lcos sets  as lg electronics has developed its own light engine designed to incorporate our lcos sets 
our prospective chinese customers have indicated an interest in one of our historical products our display unit 
while we currently sell a minor amount of these display units  we expect that there will be a shift in products demanded by our prospective chinese customers  over time  from display units to lcos sets 
these trends are consistent with our overall product strategy 
we believe that the t model will become the standard for the next generation of rear projection display devices and will provide the most cost effective  high resolution microdisplays in the industry and will position us to be a potential market leader 
we believe that the t s ability to deliver megapixel resolution in a high performance  reliable  and cost effective manner was a key factor in our obtaining the supply agreement with lg electronics 
the t model is the central component of our ongoing customer acquisition strategy described above 
recent equity financing january financing in mid january  we issued and sold  of our common shares in a private placement to three institutional investors 
the purchase price of the common shares was per share 
we received approximately million in gross proceeds  before issuance costs  from the sale of these shares  which were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including the repayment of certain short term debt obligations 
we are required under a registration rights agreement  to file a registration statement for the resale of the shares within calendar days after january  and have the registration statement declared effective no later than calendar days after january  the later may be extended to no later than calendar days if the registration statement is subject to review  comments or other actions by the sec 
if the registration statement is not filed by february  or not declared effective prior to april   we may be required to pay an amount equal to of the aggregate purchase price or  as partial liquidated damages when each of these dates occur and an additional  for every days thereafter up to six months 
after six months  the percentage increases to or  for each additional days 
we have not filed a registration with respect to these shares because of our prior commitment to register first the shares sold in our october private placement 
october private placement in october  we closed a million private placement of our common shares and warrants to purchase our common shares with certain institutional and other investors 
this transaction included the sale of  common shares at a purchase price of per share and warrants to purchase  common shares with an exercise price of per share exercisable within five years from the date of issuance 
we received million in gross proceeds from this transaction  which has been and will be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we did not use a placement agent in this transaction 
three of the institutional purchasers in this transaction were investors in our november private placement of our senior secured convertible notes 
the registration statement registering these shares was filed on february  because this statement was not filed by november   we may be required to pay  as liquidated damages to the investors as of november  and every thirty days thereafter until the registration statement is filed 
we have included  as liquidated damages in non cash interest through december  additionally  because the registration statement was not declared effective by the sec prior to january   we may be required to pay  as liquidated damages to the investors as of january  and for every thirty days thereafter until the registration statement is declared effective 
august equity financing in august  we sold  of our common shares at a purchase price of per share to certain institutional investors 
those shares were included in our form s shelf registration statement file no 
 which was declared effective by the sec in july we received gross proceeds of approximately million from the transaction  which we used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the purchasers in the august equity financing had a day option  which expired without exercise on september   to purchase an additional aggregate of  of our common shares included in the shelf registration statement at a purchase price of per share 
as of the date of this filing   of our common shares included in our currently effective shelf registration statement have not been sold 
senior secured convertible debt financing on november   we completed a non brokered private placement of million of senior secured notes the senior secured convertible notes 
the senior secured convertible notes accrue interest at per annum  payable quarterly in cash or our common shares at our option  if certain conditions are met  such as the availability of an effective registration statement pursuant to which resales may be made or the availability of rule k for resale of the common shares underlying our senior secured convertible notes 
the value of the shares for the purposes of calculating interest payments shall be equal to the day trailing average of the volume weighted average prices of our common shares at the end of each quarterly interest period 
the senior secured convertible notes are due november  the senior secured convertible notes are convertible  at the option of their holders  into our common shares at the conversion price of per share 
the senior secured convertible notes are senior to notes that we issued to argyle capital management corporation  which is wholly owned by robert a 
olins  our chief executive officer and a director 
the holders of our senior secured convertible notes have a senior security interest in substantially all of our assets  except those located in south korea 
in addition  under the terms of the november financing  we are prohibited from using the proceeds from the financing to repay debt or to pay dividends 
in a letter that we received on december   one of the holders of our notes  portside growth opportunity fund  an affiliate of ramius capital group  llc  notified us of two alleged events of default under their note set forth below 
in a letter that we received on december   another holder of our notes  smithfield fiduciary llc  an affiliate of highbridge capital management  llc  notified us only with respect to the second alleged event of default  set forth below 
in a letter that we received on february   portside notified us of a third alleged event of default under their note  as set forth below 
each of these notices call for us to redeem the entire million principal amount of the portside and smithfield notes  or million in the aggregate  plus a redemption premium of  plus liquidated damages to each of these holders of the notes pursuant to section a of their notes 
the following are the alleged defaults i registration statement failure pursuant to section a i of their note based upon our filing of a post effective amendment to the registration statement on form s relating to the underlying common shares of the senior secured convertible notes reg 
no 
 ii failure to make interest payment pursuant to section a v of their note based upon a claim that we did not make a november interest payment  and iii entering into unpermitted debt financing transactions prohibited pursuant to section a xi of their note based upon a claim that certain debt financing transactions that we have entered into are not permitted under the note 
we believe after review with outside legal counsel  that these allegations lack merit and would not entitle the noteholders to call the notes and other remedies that they are seeking 
with respect to the first alleged event of default concerning the alleged registration maintenance failure  we contend that the filing of our post effective amendments to the registration statements registering the underlying common shares did not and does not constitute an event of default under section a i of the portside note 
we contend that the second allegation of default is incorrect because on november  the interest due date  we tendered payment by forwarding checks payable to portside  smithfield and the other holders of the notes by overnight courier to an attorney representing the holders for the full amounts of the relevant quarterly interest payments 
that attorney did not distribute the checks to the four holders although located in the same city  but instead returned the checks to us in california 
we have since tendered payment of the full interest amount owing to all of the holders via federal funds wire into designated accounts for each of these parties 
we contend that the third allegation of default lacks merit because we believe that the debt financing transactions that we have entered into are permitted under their note and  even if deemed not permitted  do not constitute a breach or failure in any material respect under the note 
we believe that portside has undertaken to make allegations of events of default that lack merit in an attempt to achieve its objective of amending the terms of its note to their advantage  including a reduction in the conversion price of the notes or an acceleration in repayment of principal on its note  although that principal is not due and payable until the note s maturity date  which is november  we have rejected its offers in this regard 
we will continue to take appropriate actions that we believe are in the best interests of our company and our shareholders 
if the noteholders prevail in calling the senior secured convertible notes  the entire million debt obligation can become due and payable immediately  including the redemption premiums and liquidated damages 
we believe the alleged events of default of which portside and smithfield have given notice lack merit and would not entitle the noteholders to the remedies that they are seeking 
therefore  we believe it is not probable the noteholders would prevail in calling the notes 
as a result  in accordance with fas  accounting for contingencies  we have continued to classify the senior secured convertible notes as a long term obligation in our balance sheet at december   rather than as a current liability as fas  classification of obligations that are callable by the creditor  might otherwise require 
the redemption premium and liquidated damages of million and approximately million  respectively  have not been accrued in the consolidated financial statements as of december  we refer you to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information regarding the accounting treatment of the senior secured convertible notes 
certain developments as previously reported in our post effective amendments to the form s registration statement registering the common shares underlying the senior secured convertible notes the financing registration statement file no 
and the form s registration statement registering common shares on a shelf the shelf registration statement file no 
 we filed an unauthorized consent of bdo siedman to amendment nos 
and to the financing registration statement and to amendment nos 
and to the shelf registration statement in order to incorporate by reference their report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
although we received the requisite authorized consents from bdo seidman to the incorporation by reference of their report on the consolidated financing statements into the financing registration statement and the shelf registration statement when initially filed and in subsequent amendments thereto and bdo seidman has not withdrawn these subsequent consents  we did not receive the requisite authorization from bdo seidman to file its consent as an exhibit to the penultimate and final pre effective amendments to either the financing registration statement or the shelf registration statement ie amendment nos 
and and amendment nos 
and to the respective registration statements 
the penultimate and final pre effective amendments to both the financing registration statement and the shelf registration statement were filed with the sec on july  the disclosure contained in these penultimate and final pre effective amendments did not relate in any way to our fiscal year and consolidated financial statements 
the audit committee of our board of directors conducted an investigation and review of the developments pertaining to the bdo seidman consent issue with the assistance of independent counsel 
the audit committee delivered its draft report  dated october   to our chief executive officer  robert a 
olins 
the report concluded that the evidence does not support a finding that any of our employees included the unauthorized bdo consents in the amendments to the registration statements referred to above with fraudulent intent or with specific knowledge that bdo seidman had not authorized the filing of these consents 
it concluded that the evidence was consistent with our inclusion of the consents due to lack of communication  a series of misunderstandings and or a failure of inquiry 
as to mr 
olins  the report concluded that the audit committee found no evidence that mr 
olins was informed that bdo seidman had not authorized the filing of these consents 
however  it also found no evidence that mr 
olins inquired or determined whether bdo seidman had in fact authorized inclusion of the consents in these filings 
the audit committee report determined that mr 
olins  as our chief executive officer  did not exercise sufficient diligence in supervising the filing of the amendments to the registration statements  that this was a particularly serious failing in light of the sec having highlighted the need for consents from bdo seidman  and that as ceo he bears responsibility for the filings 
the audit committee also stated its belief that  throughout the process of preparing and filing the amendments to the registration statements  mr 
olins acted with our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders in mind  and that his lack of diligence was not motivated by self interest and that nothing related to this incident personally benefited him financially 
the audit committee recommended three remedial actions 
it concluded that the membership of the board of directors should be supplemented with a financial expert within the meaning of sec rules 
it also concluded that we must improve our corporate governance and disclosure controls  including hiring a full time chief financial officer and a controller who can be the same person 
it further concluded that by reason of mr 
olins responsibility as ceo for supervision of corporate filings  he should reimburse us for the sum of  a portion of the costs incurred by us by reason of the unauthorized bdo seidman consents and the resulting inquiries 
in compliance with the draft audit committee report  in december  mr 
olins made the  payment to reimburse the company 
to date  our board of directors has not been supplemented with a financial expert and we have not hired a fulltime cfo or controller 
we have been advised by the staff of the sec that the staff is conducting an investigation into matters and events pertaining to the filing of the unauthorized bdo consent 
we have been cooperating fully with the staff with respect to this matter 
on december   we filed post effective amendment no 
to the financing registration statement and the shelf registration statement for the purpose of filing an amended exhibit  which included the consent of the independent registered public accounting firm  odenberg  ullakko  muranishi co  llp oum 
that consent allows us to incorporate by reference into that registration statement the consolidated financial statements appearing in our annual report on form k a filed on december   for each of the three years ended december  in february  we were advised by the staff of the sec that post effective amendment no 
to both the financing registration statement and the shelf registration statement were declared effective by the sec 
liquidity and capital resources through december   we have sustained recurring net losses from operations and  at december   we had a stockholders deficit of approximately  during  we experienced negative cash flows from operating activities of approximately  and a net loss of approximately  our operations were primarily funded in by the proceeds derived from exercises of warrants and options of approximately  proceeds of approximately million that we received from the sale of  of our common shares on october   proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  of our common shares in august  and the remaining proceeds from the sale of  of senior secured convertible notes in november as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of approximately  from the december  amount of  our net working capital deficit at december   was approximately  compared to a net positive working capital of approximately  at december  net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately  and  in and  respectively 
this increase is due primarily to increased pre production activities in our south korean subsidiary 
net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million and million in and  respectively 
this increase stemmed from acquiring and building our south korean manufacturing facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
this resulted from the aggregate net proceeds of million raised in two separate equity private placement transactions in and net proceeds of million from short term loans during net cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from the issuance of the senior secured convertible notes totaling as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we have experienced significant losses in the past and expect that these losses will continue until we start to generate significant revenues from the sale of our products 
we generated revenue of approximately  during although we are expecting to generate revenues from the sale of our products in  we may continue to operate at a loss during there can be no assurance that our business will operate on a profitable basis thereafter 
in september  robert a 
olins  our chief executive officer and a director  disposed of  of our common shares at a sale price of per share 
pursuant to the short swing profit provisions of the exchange act  mr 
olins subsequently disgorged  to us for the profit that he realized from his sale of our common shares 
the total aggregate profit was calculated by using the lowest purchase prices at which mr 
olins purchased  of our common shares during the six months immediately preceding september  we anticipate that our cash expenditures during will approximate  per month  or approximately million for the year  without regard to any revenue in we expect to meet our immediate cash needs and fund our immediate working capital requirements with our existing cash balances and from additional sources 
those sources include proceeds of approximately million that we received from the sale of  of our common shares on january   as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  cash payments from our customers  the exercises of stock options and warrants  and additional sales of our common shares 
we also have approximately million available under revolving credit facilities that we established in september and october and january in south korea 
there can be no assurances with respect to these potential sources 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents as of december   combined with the proceeds from the january financing and available draw downs on south korean credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for our operations through mid march we will be required to raise significant amounts of additional capital to continue to fund our operations on a going forward basis 
to raise additional capital  we plan to sell the million common shares that we have available for sale under a currently effective shelf registration statement 
we also believe that we will be required to complete additional equity and or debt financings in if we are unable to obtain additional funds on reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue our operations at current levels  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have long term contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to payment of debt and lease arrangements 
the following table aggregates our expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years over years total long term convertible debt senior secured convertible notes short term loans interest on senior secured convertible notes operating lease commitments total contractual cash obligations all interest underlying the notes  at the contractual rate of  has been prepaid through the issuance of common shares see note to consolidated financial statements 
subject to certain conditions  interest is payable in cash or common shares at the option of the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the holders of  principal amount of these notes have alleged certain events of default under these notes 
as a consequence of these alleged defaults  these holders have demanded their immediate redemption 
we strongly dispute that any events of default have occurred that would allow the noteholders to call their notes

results of operations three years ended december   and revenue 
we recognized sales revenue of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue in was related to deliveries made pursuant to agreements relating to the sale of our t lcos sets and light engines  primarily to customers in china 
during we changed our focus to the further development  manufacture and sale of our t lcos sets  primarily to lg electronics 
revenue in was related to initial shipments against purchase orders signed in see status of business with lg electronics  status of business in taiwan and status of business in china under this item for a more detailed description of the agreements relating to the sale of our products 
the following table summarizes our sales revenue percentages by product for the years ended  and lcos t sets lcos t sets light engine display units other primarily supporting electronics total revenues significantly decreased from to because of problems that we experienced in the manufacturing of our t lcos sets 
these problems  and their resolution  are discussed in greater detail under item management s discussion and analysis status of business with lg electronics  inc gross margin 
gross margin changed from a negative  in to a positive of  in to a negative  in gross margin increased in compared to due to the higher percentage of lcos sets sales  as their margins are greater than those on display units 
during our manufacturing facility in south korea became operational 
once production began  our costs associated with this facility became part of our cost of revenue 
these costs include a certain level of relatively fixed overhead costs  including personnel related costs  to operate and maintain our manufacturing facilities 
once these relatively fixed overhead costs are covered  we expect to enjoy a contribution margin on additional sales 
when we incur these costs without sufficient revenues from the sale of our products to offset them  we report negative margins 
our sales have been relatively minor to date  and have not yet covered the cost of operating our south korean manufacturing facility 
due to the addition of these costs  there is currently no direct correlation between costs and revenue during cost of revenue in includes a reserve of  related to a percentage of our t inventory 
while we believe we can sell this inventory  we have shifted our focus to the manufacture and sale of our t product and are not currently manufacturing our t product 
sales of our t product were minimal during selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively  and include professional services  salaries and related taxes and benefits  rent  depreciation  travel  insurance  and office expenses 
accounting  consulting and legal services increased by   and  respectively in compared to accounting related services increased primarily due to the re audit of and financial statements by oum as well as increased audit fees to cover compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sox related compliance and the audit of our south korean subsidiary in consulting services included increases related to sox compliance efforts and implementation of our navision software system 
legal fees increased due primarily to our correspondence related to our filings with the sec as well as increased legal services incurred for various financing arrangements entered into during salaries and related taxes and benefits increased by approximately  in compared to and primarily relates to administrative wages in our new south korean manufacturing facility 
this facility incurred an additional  in general and administrative expenses during these increases are partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of  see below 
this reserve was created in and was directly associated with a particular customer 
the associated receivable was written off against this reserve during salaries and related taxes and benefits increased approximately  in over as a result of the reassignment of employees from research and development to general and administrative and an additional increase in the number of general and administrative and sales staff 
the increase in the amount of salary and related costs was approximately  in addition  travel and entertainment increased by approximately  between and due to travel by our sales and marketing team as well as by management to generate new business 
in addition  in we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately  to reserve a receivable from one of our chinese customers 
we reserved this receivable based upon information provided to us by our chinese sales representative that this customer was awaiting additional pending corporate financing and would likely not be able to pay us for our product deliveries prior to receiving that additional financing 
stock based general and administrative expenses 
stock based general and administrative expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the amounts incurred relate to common shares  options to purchase common shares and warrants issued in exchange for services in  and  costs of   and  respectively  relate primarily to stock and options granted to employees and directors  and warrants issued in exchange for services 
in addition  the amounts incurred in include a  reduction in a note receivable from one of our shareholders in exchange for a commitment to invest an additional  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts incurred in relate primarily to stock based expense of approximately  associated with the may private financing transaction

for more information concerning the foregoing  see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to is due to the pre production activities of our south korean manufacturing facility 
this includes the cost of operating the manufacturing facility prior to commencing production as well as supplies and materials used in these efforts 
the decrease in as compared to was due to the reclassification of existing employees to general and administrative duties  offset by an increase in consulting services related to our integrated circuit design 
interest expense 
interest expense was approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
these amounts are consistent with the balances in notes payable 
the increase during is related to the november senior secured convertible notes of  which bear interest at per annum 
non cash interest expense 
non cash interest expense of approximately   and  in  and  respectively  primarily relates to the valuation of the beneficial conversion feature of interest converted and convertible into equity on the notes payable to argyle capital management corporation  a company wholly owned by robert a 
olins  chief executive officer  secretary  treasurer and a director of spatialight  based on the intrinsic value of the conversion feature 
the beneficial conversion interest represents the excess market value of the shares issued or issuable at current market prices over accrued interest payable 
in november  these notes were extended until december  amortization of the discount on the argyle notes is included in non cash interest expense 
also included in non cash interest expense in is the amortization of note discounts related to the november financing 
the note discounts primarily resulted from the valuation of the additional investment rights or note purchase option  and beneficial conversion feature 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gain from revaluation of note purchase option liability

this air expired on august  see note to consolidated financial statements 
the gain in also includes an expired investment right of  associated with our august financing 
gain on fair value of warrants

these warrants are being treated as derivatives and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value until the registration statement underlying the associated shares is declared effective by the sec 
foreign currency translation gain 
the gain of approximately  relates to the revaluation of intercompany payables recorded in local currency and then revalued at the balance sheet date to the then current exchange rate 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income in was due to interest earned on a stock subscription receivable from a shareholder 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
interest in and was primarily bank interest 
other income in includes approximately  of subsidies from the south korean government 
loss before income taxes 
losses before income taxes were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in losses from to is primarily due to costs associated with starting up our south korean manufacturing facility coupled with negligible sales 
additional factors include approximately  of increased interest expense associated with our  notes  of which is non cash 
the decrease in these losses from to is due to an increase in gross margin of approximately  as well as a decrease in stock based compensation of approximately  offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
income taxes 
income taxes consist primarily of minimum state tax requirements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this report 
inflation 
our management currently believes that inflation has not had a material impact on continuing operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions  particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates  where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and  generally to a lesser extent  cash flows 
senior management and the audit committee of the board of directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates  and have reviewed the processes to determine those estimates 
revenue recognition we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions using the following criteria collectively called the revenue recognition criteria evidence of an arrangement before revenue is recognized  we must have evidence of an agreement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions to deliver our products 
delivery for products  delivery is considered to occur when title and risk of loss have been transferred  which generally occurs upon shipment 
fixed or determinable fee we consider a fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize that amount as revenue when the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
we do not consider a fee to be fixed and determinable if any amount is due more than days from the delivery date 
payment terms of less than days are evaluated based upon the laws or trade practices of the country in which the arrangement is entered into to assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable 
collection is deemed reasonably assured collection is deemed reasonably assured if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
we reduce product revenue for customer returns and sales allowances and record an allowance for doubtful accounts should collectibility become questionable 
if it is determined that an account is uncollectible  the account is written off against the allowance 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost based on the first in  first out method or market value 
we include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead in the cost of inventories 
in determining inventory market values  we give substantial consideration to the expected selling price of the product based on historical recovery rates 
if we assess the market value of our inventory to be less than costs we write it down to its replacement cost or its net realizable value 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity  quality and mix of products in inventory  consumer and retailer preferences and economic conditions 
research and development research and development costs  including the costs of prototype and pre production lcos sets  pre production display units  and other pre production activities at our south korean manufacturing facility are charged to expense when incurred 
income tax assets and liabilities in establishing our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to our operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
due to our lack of profitable operating history  potential limitations on usage of operating losses and general uncertainty  we provided for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we are also subject to examination of our income tax returns for multiple years by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes to our income tax provision or the valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities may affect our annual effective income tax rate

in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb approved the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the objective of eitf was to provide guidance for identifying impaired investments 
eitf also provided new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired 
the accounting provisions of eitf were effective for all reporting periods beginning after june   while the disclosure requirements were effective only for annual periods ending after june  in september  the fasb deferred the requirement to record impairment losses caused by the effect of increases in risk free interest rates and sector spreads on debt securities subject to paragraph of eitf and excludes minor impairments from the requirement until new guidance becomes effective

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we place all of our excess cash and cash equivalents in a checking account or money market account in the united states 
we do not expect any material losses from our placement of such cash balances  and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  of this amount  approximately  was in south korea 
a portion of our costs is denominated in foreign currencies  including the south korean won and the euro 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currencies to the us dollar will affect our financial results  including costs of revenue and operating expenses  and could result in exchange losses or gains 
we cannot fully predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our profitability 
from time to time  we may engage in exchange rate hedging activities in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  although we have not engaged in any such hedging activities to date
