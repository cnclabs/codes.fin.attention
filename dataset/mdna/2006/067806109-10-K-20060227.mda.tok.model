at associated spring  kpis include sales and orders per day  which together provide visibility on sales in the next days 
management tracks inventory turns and sales per employee to gauge efficiency  and measures on time delivery and the number of defective parts per million as means of evaluating customer service levels 
at barnes aerospace  important kpis are customer orders and backlog  which are utilized to forecast how sales will develop over the next months 
in the oem operations  management closely tracks quality measurements and on time delivery to its customers 
in the aftermarket operations  management measures quality and turnaround time of overhauled or repaired parts returned to the customers 
key industry data in each business  management also tracks a variety of economic and industry data as indicators of the health of a particular sector 
at barnes distribution  the data includes the institute for supply management s pmi composite index the pmi and the federal reserve s industrial production index the ipi  which are monthly indicators of the health of us manufacturing activity 
management tracks similar indices in canada  france and the united kingdom and also utilizes the business conditions report of the precision metalforming association  which correlates well with demand for barnes distribution s raymond products

table of contents liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditure levels  dividends  capital stock transactions  effective utilization of surplus cash positions overseas and adequate lines of credit 
the company s ability to generate cash from operations in excess of its internal operating needs is one of its financial strengths

this financial restructuring provided a number of key benefits including reduction of refinancing risk  increased financial flexibility  reduced borrowing costs  and the ability of us bank lenders to participate directly in the global expansion of the company 
the new structure provides rapid financing through efficient deployment of cash to support operations wherever needed 
borrowing capacity is limited by various debt covenants in the company s debt agreements 
the most restrictive borrowing capacity covenant required the company to maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda  as defined in the new revolving credit agreement  of not more than times at december  the actual ratio at december  was times and would have allowed additional borrowings of at least million

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results could differ from such estimates 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company changed the method of determining the cost of certain us inventories which previously utilized the last in  first out method to the first in  first out method as of january  provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
loss provisions  if any  on contracts are established when estimable 
loss provisions are based on the projected excess of manufacturing costs over the net revenues of the products or group of related products under contract 
the process for evaluating the value of excess and obsolete inventory often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future adjustments to these provisions 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing
