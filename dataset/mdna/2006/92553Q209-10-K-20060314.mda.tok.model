neurocare revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the sales decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our peripheral vascular high end systems and older neurodiagnostic eeg and iom products partially offset by higher sales of our audio diagnostic products  sales from our new neurodiagnostic eeg and emg products and an increase in service revenue of million 
we had an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in this decrease was primarily due to the following lower sales volume and pricing pressures on older product lines  both of which reduced gross margin  higher selling  general and administrative expense primarily related to higher legal and international operating expenses  higher amortization expense related to our recent acquisition of the audioscreener hearing screening device  costs of million related to the restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of  inventory write offs of obsolete inventory related to discontinued products  and the write off of purchased in process research and development costs in the fourth quarter of related to the acquisition of taugagreining

on may   we entered into a five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility  replacing the million senior revolving credit facility which was set to expire on may  the facility includes a million letter of credit sub facility and a million swing line loan sub facility 
at the request of the company  the aggregate maximum principal amount available under the facility may be increased to million 
the lenders  however  are not obligated to participate in the increased portion of the facility 
the facility can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and acquisitions 
at december   million was outstanding under the facility  with outstanding under the swing line loan sub facility 
in addition  million of standby letters of credit had been issued under the facility  and million was available for borrowings under the facility 
at the company s option  loans borrowed under the facility other than swing line loans bear interest at either libor plus an applicable margin that will vary based on the company s leverage ratio as defined in the agreement  or the alternative base rate  defined as the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
swing line loans bear interest at a rate determined by the swing line lender 
the company is required to pay a facility fee based on the total revolving commitment 
our ability to access the facility will depend on complying with certain customary affirmative and negative covenants  including but not limited to our ability to maintain a leverage ratio of debt to ebitda of not greater than to  an interest coverage ratio of ebitda to interest expense of not less than to  minimum stockholders equity and limits on the amount of capital expenditures in any one year to the greater of million or of the company s consolidated net assets 
while we are currently in compliance with the debt covenants of the facility and expect to be able to meet the requirements of the facility through the expiration date  failure to satisfy any of the conditions would require us to renegotiate the facility on terms that may not be as favorable or could require us to repay any outstanding balance 
while we would attempt to find alternative sources to fund our operations from other financial institutions  we cannot assure you that we would be successful  or if we were successful  that the new credit arrangement would be on terms that would be attractive to us in financing our business plans 
during  we expect to spend between million to million on capital expenditures  primarily related to product development activities  capacity and efficiency improvement projects  and commencement of the implementation of a new company wide information systems platform 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our sales growth  market acceptance of our new products  research and development spending and the success of our product development efforts  capital spending policies of our customers  government spending policies and general economic conditions 
in  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan to lower our cost structure 
the purpose of this action was to bring expenses in line with the growth in our core businesses and enhance our near and long term profitability 
as a result of this initiative  we incurred a total pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million  all of which has been recognized and paid in and we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations and cash available under the facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and commitments for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance unforeseen requirements or to acquire other businesses  products or technologies 
these funds may be obtained through the sale of equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
if funds are raised by issuing additional equity securities or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  equity or debt securities issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock

critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for each period 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
we believe that the following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of products and to a lesser extent the provision of services and rental of equipment 
revenues for products that require installation for which the installation either is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory are recognized upon transfer of title with estimated installation costs accrued 
service revenues are derived from parts  service contracts  training  repairs not under warranty and research and development for third parties 
we sell service contracts on products when the warranty period expires 
we recognize revenues from these service contracts ratably over the terms of the contracts  while the cost is recognized when incurred 
revenues from the sale of spare parts are recognized upon transfer of title 
revenues from training and repairs are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
we rent products  primarily in the respiratory care segment  to hospitals and other customers for periods ranging from two weeks to over a year 
we recognize rental revenues ratably over the terms of the rental contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our historical collections experience  historical write offs of our receivables  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in first out method 
costs include direct materials  direct labor and applicable manufacturing overhead  and other direct costs 
at each balance sheet date  we review our quantities of inventories on hand and compare these amounts to the expected usage of each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 as of december  under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicate possible impairment 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
we performed our annual sfas no 
goodwill impairment assessment for our reporting units as of november  and determined that there was no impairment 
stock based compensation stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors 
upon vesting  an option becomes exercisable  meaning  an employee or director can purchase a share of the company s common stock at a price that is equal to the closing share price on the day of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  permits companies either to continue accounting for stock options under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or to adopt a fair value based method to measure compensation cost 
under apb no 
 which we have elected to continue using  there is no compensation cost if  on the date of grant  the option s exercise price is equal to or greater than the share price 
under sfas no 
 an option s fair value is estimated on the date of grant  and the value is expensed evenly over the vesting period 
if we had accounted for stock based compensation under the sfas no 
fair value based method  net loss would have increased by million for and net income would have been reduced by million and million for and  respectively 
in order to estimate an option s fair value under sfas no 
 we use the black scholes option valuation model 
the option valuation model requires a number of assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected option life the amount of time until the options are exercised or expire 
expected option life is based on actual exercise activity from previous option grants 
volatility is calculated based upon stock price movements over a period of time 
additionally  our share price on the day of grant influences the option value 
the higher the share price  as compared to the grant price  the more the option is worth 
changes in the option value after the day of grant are not reflected in expense 
any change in these assumptions could significantly impact the values calculated by the option valuation model and  consequently  the pro forma effects disclosed under the caption stock based compensation in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs sfas no 

this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and waste material spoilage 
sfas no 
requires such abnormal expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows

r at the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after june  this statement is a revision to sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method on january  in addition  the sec issued sab no 
share based payments in march  which provides supplemental sfas no 
r application guidance based on the views of the sec 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will not affect our net cash flows or net financial position  but it will reduce reported net income and earnings per share because we will be required to recognize compensation expense for share purchase rights granted under its employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  whereas we have not been required to record such expense under current accounting rules 
beginning january   we have adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method whereby compensation cost is recognized for new awards granted and awards modified  repurchased  and cancelled after january  for the unvested portion of all awards issued prior to and outstanding at january  compensation cost measured at their respective grant date fair values will be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered 
based on the awards outstanding at december  and the awards expected to be granted in  we estimate that total stock based compensation will result in a charge to net income of approximately  in sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were   and  in  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
foreign currency risk we derive approximately of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is transacted through a network of international subsidiaries and third party distributors 
revenues generated through business transacted by international subsidiaries are generally in the local currency that is considered the functional currency of that foreign subsidiary 
expenses are also incurred in the foreign currencies to match revenues earned and minimize our exchange rate exposure to operating margins 
the company generally views its investment in most of its foreign subsidiaries as long term 
the effects of a change in foreign currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a depreciation in functional currencies relative to the us dollar would have resulted in a decrease in the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries of approximately million at december  interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the rate that these financial instruments may adjust to in the future 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility which bears interest at variable rates 
changes in interest rates will affect the amount of our interest payments over the term of the loan 
a basis point increase in interest rates under the facility would have an estimated negative impact on pre tax earnings of approximately  based on the amount outstanding on the facility as of december
