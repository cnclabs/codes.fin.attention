item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results we are a leading provider of enterprise incentive management eim software systems to global companies across multiple industries 
large enterprises use eim systems to model  administer  analyze and report on incentive compensation  or pay for performance plans  which compensate employees and business partners for the achievement of targeted quantitative and qualitative objectives  such as sales quotas  product development milestones and customer satisfaction 
we sell our eim products both directly through our sales force and indirectly through our strategic partners pursuant to perpetual or term software licenses  and offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
we also generate maintenance and support revenues associated with our product licenses  which are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement 
in  we had significant changes to our management team 
in may  we hired robert youngjohns as our new president and chief executive officer 
in september  we hired shanker trivedi as vice president  chief marketing officer and andrew armstrong as vice president of sales in the europe  middle east and africa region 
in november  we hired leslie stretch as our vice president of worldwide sales 
we also announced the appointments of william binch and michele patton to our board of directors in we consider the hiring and appointment of these seasoned individuals as key additions to our leadership team needed to refine and build on our near and long term business strategies 
new products and services released in included truecomp enterprise  the fifth generation of our product suite  in september and callidus trueanalytics  our first new application in over two years  in december 
new service offerings  released in the fourth quarter  include managed service solutions  compensation strategy consulting  and workflow solution packs 
we have also introduced a hosted or on demand offering for customers who prefer a software as a service model 
in  our total revenues increased by to million from million in this increase was the result of a increase in license revenues  partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and service revenues in compared to the positive change in license revenues was driven by an increase in the number of sales to both new and existing customers 
as a result of this substantial increase in higher margin license revenues  our overall gross margin increased to in  compared to in the prior year 
operating expenses decreased by  to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in stock based compensation  a million decrease in impairment charges  a million decrease in restructuring charges  a million reduction in sales and marketing and a million reduction in research and development expenses in compared to these reductions were partially offset by a million increase in general and administrative expenses in as a result of the significant increase in license revenues and lower operating expenses  our net loss decreased in to million  compared with a net loss in of million 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million in ending the year at million 
from a business perspective  we have a number of sales opportunities in process and many additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  however  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our license transactions and the timing of revenue recognition resulting from greater flexibility in licensing terms 
we believe one of our major challenges is increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products over competing it projects 
to address these challenges  we are refocusing our marketing efforts on the strategic benefits of our products  continuing to invest in the development of new modules for our truecomp suite to broadening and increasing its strategic value  being more flexible and innovative in our licensing terms and in the methods we use to deliver our products 
we believe these initiatives will  over time  increase the strategic value of our products and help us better realize the market opportunity ahead of us 

table of contents if we are unable to convince potential customers of the value proposition of our products  and if our market does not improve  we may be unable to return to profitability or to levels of sales achieved in in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in factors that could affect future results 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  our use of estimates and the related disclosures with our audit committee 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily by licensing software and providing related software maintenance and professional services to our customers 
our software arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products in perpetuity  generally based on a specified number of payees  and ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates  generally over renewable twelve month periods 
if we are selected to provide integration and configuration services  then the software arrangement will also include professional services  generally priced on a time and materials basis 
depending upon the elements in the arrangement and the terms of the related agreement  we recognize license revenues under either the residual or the contract accounting method 
residual method 
license fees are recognized upon delivery when licenses are either sold separately from integration and configuration services  or together with integration and configuration services  provided that i the criteria described below have been met  ii payment of the license fees is not dependent upon performance of the integration and configuration services  and iii the services are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize these license revenues using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenues are recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each undelivered element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for a certain class of transactions  the fair value of the maintenance portion of our arrangements is based on stated renewal rates rather than stand 
table of contents alone sales 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the items for which evidence of fair value cannot be established are delivered 
if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then the entire amount of revenue is recognized over the maintenance delivery period 
contract accounting method 
for arrangements where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  such as where the payment of the license fees is dependent upon performance of the services  both the license and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we generally use the percentage of completion method because we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to contract costs and the extent of progress toward completion 
however  if we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates  we use the completed contract method 
if total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated loss on the arrangement 
for all of our software arrangements  we will not recognize revenue until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
we consider delivery to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier  or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until cash collection 
a customer typically prepays maintenance for the first twelve months  and the related revenues are deferred and recognized over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional services revenues primarily consist of integration and configuration services related to the installation of our products and training revenues 
our implementation services do not involve customization to  or development of  the underlying software code 
substantially all of our professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis 
to the extent we enter into a fixed fee services contract  a loss will be recognized any time the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenues 
certain arrangements result in the payment of customer referral fees to third parties that resell our software products 
in these arrangements  license revenues are recorded  net of such referral fees  at the time the software license has been delivered to a third party reseller and an end user customer has been identified 
we anticipate that subscription revenues  which include term licensing arrangements and fees from hosting services for our software applications to customers who prefer an on demand or software as a service model  will be recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract 
amounts that have been invoiced will be recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or 
table of contents revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recently began offering hosting services and as of december   we had no such subscription revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is netted against accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  totaled approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
we generally guarantee that our services will be performed in accordance with the criteria agreed upon in a statement of work  which we generally execute with each applicable customer prior to commencing work 
should these services not be performed in accordance with the agreed upon criteria  we would provide remediation services until such time as the criteria are met 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists  management must use judgments and make estimates of sales return reserves related to potential future requirements to provide remediation services in connection with current period service revenues 
when providing for sales return reserves  we analyze historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues  if for any period  actual returns differ from management s judgments or estimates 
the sales return reserve balance  which is netted against our accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  was approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
impairment of purchased technology and intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
in  as a result of a decline in financial performance  we assessed whether the purchased technology and other intangible assets acquired from cezanne software were impaired 
we compared the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
based on this assessment  we determined the asset group had no value and recorded an impairment charge of million as a cost of revenues and million as an operating expense 
the million impairment related to unamortized capitalized software costs 
the million impairment consisted of a million impairment to an assembled workforce intangible asset and an approximately  impairment of a favorable lease asset 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance  market conditions  and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
as of december   we had no remaining intangible assets 
stock based compensation through the end of  we adopted sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  but in accordance with sfas  we have elected not to apply fair value based accounting for our employee stock option plans 
instead  we measure compensation expense for our employee stock option plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we record deferred stock based compensation to the extent 
table of contents the fair value of our common stock for financial accounting purposes exceeds the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant  and amortize these amounts to expense using the accelerated method over the vesting schedule of the options  which is generally four years 
for options granted after our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock is its closing price on the nasdaq stock market on the date of grant 
for options granted prior to our initial public offering  the deemed fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors 
the board of directors determined the deemed fair value of our common stock by considering a number of factors  including  but not limited to  our operating performance  significant events in our history  issuances of our convertible preferred stock  trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation to be obtained in an initial public offering 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of the stock options  materially different amounts of stock compensation expenses could have been reported 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of approximately million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortized stock based compensation expense  net was approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as required by sfas  as modified by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 we provide pro forma disclosure of the effect of using the fair value based method of measuring stock based compensation expense 
for purposes of the pro forma disclosure  we estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees using the black scholes option valuation model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions including the expected life of options and our expected stock price volatility 
therefore  the estimated fair value of our employee stock options could vary significantly as a result of changes in the assumptions used 
see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will account for stock options using the fair value method under fasb statement no 
r revised  shared based payment sfas r  which will significantly increase our stock based compensation expense in our statement of operations 
please see our recent accounting pronouncements for additional discussion of sfas no 
r 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  and while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment and is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair 
table of contents values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r will be effective for annual periods beginning after june  and  accordingly  we will adopt the new accounting provisions effective january  upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we can elect to recognize stock based compensation related to employee equity awards in our consolidated statements of operations using the fair value method on a modified prospective basis and disclose the pro forma effect on net income or loss assuming the use of the fair value method in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to adoption or we can elect to adopt the new principle on a retrospective basis  in which case we would restate previously reported operating results 
further  we are required to adopt one of the fair value methods described in sfas r for measuring compensation expense 
we believe we will use the black scholes fair value method 
since we currently account for equity awards granted to our employees using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles as well as changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance it does not include specific transition provisions 
specifically  sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  in november  the fasb issued fsp no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss 
additionally fsp includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and  accordingly  we will adopt the new accounting provisions as of january  we do not expect the adoption of fsp to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

license revenues increased million or in primarily due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers 
the average license revenue per transaction in was million compared to million in we had six transactions in with a license value over million compared to four such transactions in in  we expect our license revenues to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter since we generally complete a relatively small number of transactions in a quarter and the prices on those software license sales can vary widely 
maintenance and service revenues 
maintenance and service revenues decreased by million or in the decrease is the result of a million  or  decline in our consulting service revenues  partially offset by a million  or  increase in maintenance revenues 
the decrease in service revenues is primarily due to an increase in implementations being performed by third parties 
in the fourth quarter of  million of services performed was deferred instead of recognized because we determined that collection was not probable at the time the services were performed as a result of a single customer dispute 
maintenance revenues increased as a result of existing customer maintenance renewals as well as new customer maintenance agreements in we plan to expand our services organization in to support our new services offerings  including on demand and managed services  compensation consulting and workflow solution packs 
while we expect this expansion to result in increased service revenues  but possibly at a lower related gross margin as we invest in the business to achieve this growth overall 
service revenues may be negatively impacted to the extent a larger portion of our customers select a third party to implement our software rather than us 
we expect continued growth in maintenance revenues in driven by product sales to new customers and renewals on existing contracts 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased by million or in primarily due to lower royalty payment obligations to third parties 
in  we recorded million of amortization expense from purchased technology related to our trueperformance product 
we do not anticipate any changes to our third party technology agreements in accordingly  we expect license gross margins to remain at or above for cost of maintenance and service revenues 
cost of maintenance and service revenues decreased by million or in the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in maintenance and service revenues as discussed above 
impairment of purchased technology 
we discontinued our trueperformance product in july based on our assessment of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we determined the asset had no value 
accordingly  in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our unamortized capitalized software costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents gross margin 
our overall gross margin increased to in from in the increase in our gross margin is attributable primarily to the shift in revenue mix to higher margin license revenues  which represented of our total revenues in compared to of total revenues in in the future  we expect our gross margins to fluctuate depending on the mix of license versus maintenance and service revenues recorded as well as stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of sfas r

sales and marketing expenses in decreased compared to the decrease was primarily due to declines in personnel costs of million from lower headcount  travel expenses of million  contract employees of million and facilities expense of million 
the decreases were partially offset by an increase in commission expense of million 
excluding commissions  which vary as a function of sales  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in as we invest in our business by growing our sales force and increasing our marketing efforts to drive further revenue growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the discontinuation in of our trueperformance product  including decreases in personnel costs from headcount reduction of million and outside professional fees of million 
we expect our research and development expense will increase in due to a planned increase in headcount associated with an acceleration of our product development efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in compared to the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel costs associated with an increase in headcount  million increase in external professional fees to document our internal controls related to section of the sarbanes oxley act and a million increase primarily related to the recruitment of our new chief executive officer and other management personnel 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily due to external audit and professional fees to document and test our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
although we incurred some costs in related to compliance with section  we determined on june  that we were not an accelerated filer and would not need to obtain internal or external opinions on internal controls related to section for accordingly  our section costs were lower in than originally anticipated at the beginning of the year 
impairment of intangible assets 
in connection with our decision to discontinue the trueperformance product  during we recorded impairment charges of million related to the write off of the purchased assembled workforce and approximately  for a favorable lease 

table of contents restructuring expenses 
during  we undertook a restructuring plan that included discontinuing our trueperformance product line and eliminating positions or of our workforce  including our trueperformance development team in italy 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in  most of which related to employee termination costs 
all restructuring costs were paid in stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense decreased from compared to the decrease in stock based compensation in was primarily due to the reversal of expense previously recognized on unvested pre ipo options that were cancelled 
additionally  the company recorded a charge in of million resulting from the modification of stock options associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
the reduction in stock based compensation was partially offset by an additional  of expense related to the modification of stock options associated with the resignation of our senior vice president of operations in the first quarter of in  we expect stock based compensation to increase as we will be required to comply with the new accounting standard  sfas no 
r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement at the time of the grant based on their fair values 
we are in the process of assessing the impact this revised standard will have on our financial results 
we currently expect that the impact will be material

as a result of the decline in license revenues in the first half of the year  we undertook a restructuring action early in the third quarter that reduced our workforce by approximately and made additional reductions in discretionary spending 
as a result of these actions we were able to substantially reduce our cost structure in the second half of compared to the first half of sales and marketing

in  net cash received from the exercise of stock options and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan was million  which amount was partially offset by payments of million on our outstanding debt 
in  net cash provided by financing activities included net cash received from our initial public offering of million offset by net payments on our line of credit and long term debt of million 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments in thousands at december  operating lease obligations that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the following table 
payments due by period and contractual obligations total beyond operating leases in  we had access to a revolving line of credit that permitted borrowings of up to million 
we did not make any borrowings under this line of credit 
the line of credit expired in march and was not renewed 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  with the exception of operating lease commitments that have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
for our new york  new york and san jose  california offices  we have two certificates of deposit totaling approximately  as of december  and  as of december   in order to secure letters of credit required by the landlords for security deposits 
we believe our existing cash balances and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated short and long term cash requirements as well as the contractual obligations listed above 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancement to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
factors that could affect future results we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses  and we cannot assure you that we will achieve and sustain profitability 
we incurred net losses of million and million in and  respectively  and had net income of approximately million in we expect that our reported expenses will increase in as we expand our operations domestically and internationally and as we begin expensing stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
consequently  we expect to incur a loss in and cannot assure that we will achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
if we cannot increase our 
table of contents license revenues to compensate for our greater operating expenses  our future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected 
our quarterly license revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of transactions involving sales of our products to new customers  and any delay or failure in closing one or more of these transactions could adversely affect our results of operations 
our quarterly license revenues are typically dependent upon the closing of a relatively small number of transactions involving sales of our products to new customers 
as such  variations in the rate and timing of conversion of sales prospects into revenues could result in our failure to meet revenue objectives or achieve or maintain profitability in future periods 
in addition  we generally recognize the bulk of our license revenues for a given sale either at the time we enter into the agreement and deliver the product  or over the period in which we perform any services that are essential to the functionality of the product 
unexpected changes in the size of transactions or other contractual terms late in the negotiation process or changes in the mix of contracts we enter into could therefore materially and adversely affect our license revenues in a quarter 
delays or reductions in the amount of customers purchases or when we recognize revenues would adversely affect our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends upon our ability to develop new products and enhance our existing products 
failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products may adversely affect our operating results 
the enterprise application software market is characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards in computer hardware  software technology and communications infrastructure  changing customer needs  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
to keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  achieve market acceptance and effectively respond to competitive product introductions  we must quickly identify emerging trends and requirements  accurately define and design enhancements and improvements for existing products and timely introduce new products and services 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results 
further  any new products we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
for example  we introduced our trueperformance product in the first quarter of and discontinued it in june in connection with the discontinuation of the trueperformance product line  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in the second quarter of if we are unable to successfully and timely develop new products or enhance existing products or if we fail to position and price our products to meet market demand  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable and are likely to continue to fluctuate substantially  which may harm our results of operations 
our revenues  particularly our license revenues  are extremely difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are wholly or partially beyond our control 
for example  in the first six months of and throughout  our license revenues were substantially lower than expected due to purchasing delays by our customers and failures to close transactions resulting in significant net losses 
conversely  our license revenues for the last six months of were greater than in prior periods primarily as a result of the closing several larger transactions  but there is no assurance that we will continue the recent revenue growth 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 

table of contents factors that may cause our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate include the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles and changes in their budgets for software and related purchases  the priority our customers place on the purchase of our products as compared to other information technology and capital acquisitions  competitive conditions in our industry  including new products  product announcements and discounted pricing or special payment terms offered by our competitors  our ability to hire  train and retain appropriate sales and professional services staff  varying size  timing and contractual terms of orders for our products  which may delay the recognition of revenues  indeterminate and often lengthy sales cycles  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestitures  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  merger and acquisition activities among our customers which may alter their buying patterns  our ability to timely complete our service obligations related to product sales  the utilization rate of our professional services personnel and the degree to which we use third party consulting services  changes in the average selling prices of our products  timing of product development and new product initiatives  customers concerns regarding sarbanes oxley section compliance and implementing large  enterprise wide deployments of products  including our products  and changes in the mix of revenues attributable to higher margin product license revenues as opposed to substantially lower margin service revenues 
our products have long sales cycles  which makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
the sales cycles for our products have historically averaged between six and twelve months  and longer in some cases  to complete 
it is therefore difficult to predict the quarter in which a particular sale will close and to plan expenditures accordingly 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and its purchase of our products and services is relatively long due to several factors  including the complex nature of our products  the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products  the requirement that a potential customer invest significant resources in connection with the purchase and implementation of our products  budget cycles of our potential customers that affect the timing of purchases  customer requirements for competitive evaluation and internal approval before purchasing our products  potential delays of purchases due to announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors  and the lengthy approval processes of our potential customers  many of which are large organizations 

table of contents the failure to complete sales in a particular quarter would reduce our revenues in that quarter  as well as any subsequent quarters over which revenues for the sale would likely be recognized 
given that our license revenues are dependent on a relatively small number of transactions  any unexpected lengthening in general or for one or more large orders would adversely affect the timing and amount of our revenues 
in addition  our management makes assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenues in budgeting future operating costs and capital expenditures based on estimated closing dates and potential dollar amounts of transactions 
management aggregates these estimates periodically to generate our sales forecasts and then evaluates the forecasts to identify trends 
although we have reduced expenses to better align our costs with the expected receipt and amount of revenues  our costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  failure to complete one or more license transactions during a particular quarter would cause our quarterly results of operations to be worse than anticipated 
if we are unable to increase sales of new product licenses  our maintenance and service revenues will be materially and adversely affected 
while our license revenues have declined from levels  our maintenance and service revenues have remained relatively constant 
a substantial portion of our maintenance and service revenues  however  is derived from providing professional integration and configuration services associated with product licenses sold in prior periods 
as such  if we are unable to increase sales of our product licenses  our maintenance and service revenues will likely decline 
professional services comprise a substantial portion of our revenues and to the extent our customers choose to use other services providers  our revenues and operating results may decline 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from the performance of professional services  primarily implementation  configuration  training and other consulting services in connection with new product licenses and other ongoing projects 
however  there are a number of third party service providers available who offer these professional services and we do not require that our customers use our professional services 
to the extent our customers choose to use third party service providers over us  our revenues and operating income may decline  possibly significantly 
our latest product features and functionality may require existing customers to migrate from their existing versions to more recent versions of our software 
if existing customers fail or delay to migrate  our revenues may be harmed 
we plan to pursue sales of new product modules to existing customers of our truecomp software 
for most of these customers to take advantage of new features and functionality in our latest modules  they may need to migrate to a more current version of our products at additional cost  which they may decline to do or delay 
if a sufficient number do not migrate  our ability to sell additional products to these customers  and as a result  our revenues and operating income  may be harmed  possibly significantly 
if we do not compete effectively with competitors  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense competition from a number of software companies 
we compete principally with vendors of eim software  enterprise resource planning software  and customer relationship management software 
our competitors may announce new products  services or enhancements that better meet the needs of customers or changing industry standards 
increased competition may cause price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our enterprise resource planning competitors and other potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources 
many also have a larger installed base of users  longer operating histories or greater name recognition 
some of our competitors products may also be more effective at performing particular eim system functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in a given market 
even if our competitors provide products with more limited eim system 
table of contents functionality than our products  these products may incorporate other capabilities  such as recording and accounting for transactions  customer orders or inventory management data 
a product that performs these functions  as well as some of the functions of our software solutions  may be appealing to some customers because it would reduce the number of software applications used to run their business 
our products must be integrated with software provided by a number of our existing or potential competitors 
these competitors could alter their products in ways that inhibit integration with our products  or they could deny or delay our access to advance software releases  which would restrict our ability to adapt our products for integration with their new releases and could result in lost sales opportunities 
our maintenance and service revenues produce substantially lower gross margins than our license revenues  and decreases in license revenues relative to service revenues have harmed  and may continue to harm  our overall gross margins 
our maintenance and service revenues  which include fees for consulting  implementation  maintenance and training  were  and of our revenues for years  and  respectively 
our maintenance and service revenues have substantially lower gross margins than our license revenues 
the decrease in the percentage of total revenues represented by license revenues in and as compared to has adversely affected our overall gross margins 
failure to increase our higher margin license revenues in the future would continue to adversely affect our gross margin and operating results 
historically  maintenance and service revenues as a percentage of total revenues have varied significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in licensing revenues  changes in the average selling prices for our products and services  and competitive service providers 
in addition  the volume and profitability of services can depend in large part upon competitive pricing pressure on the rates that we can charge for our professional services  the complexity of the customers information technology environment  the resources directed by customers to their implementation projects  and the extent to which outside consulting organizations provide services directly to customers 
as an example of more recent competitive pressure on our services offerings  many of our potential customers have begun to outsource technology projects offshore to take advantage of lower labor costs 
consequently  we expect some customers to demand lower hourly rates for the professional services we provide  which may erode our margins for our maintenance and service revenues or result in lost business 
we expect maintenance and services revenue to continue to comprise a substantial majority of our overall revenues for the foreseeable future and any erosion of our margins for our maintenance and service revenue would adversely affect our operating results 
managing large scale deployments of our products requires substantial technical implementation and support by us or third party service providers 
failure to meet these requirements could cause a decline or delay in recognition of our revenues and an increase in our expenses 
our customers regularly require large  often enterprise wide deployments of our products  which require a substantial degree of technical and logistical expertise to implement and support 
it may be difficult for us to manage these deployments  including the timely allocation of personnel and resources by us and our customers 
failure to successfully manage the process could harm our reputation both generally and with specific customers and may cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the number of new customers that purchase our products  each of which could adversely affect our revenues and increase our technical support and litigation costs 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of approximately million of service revenue due to single customer dispute for an implementation project 

table of contents our software license customers have the option to receive implementation  maintenance  training and consulting services from our internal professional services organization or from outside consulting organizations 
in the future  we may be required to increase our use of third party service providers to help meet our implementation and service obligations 
if we require a greater number of third party service providers than are currently available  we will be required to negotiate additional arrangements  which may result in lower gross margins for maintenance or service revenues 
if a customer selects a third party implementation service provider and such implementation services are not provided successfully and in a timely manner  our customers may experience increased costs and errors  which may result in customer dissatisfaction and costly remediation and litigation  any of which could adversely impact our reputation  operating results and financial condition 
a substantial majority of our revenues are derived from truecomp and related products and services and a decline in sales of these products and services could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a substantial majority of our revenues from our truecomp product and related products and services 
because we have historically sold our product licenses on a perpetual basis and delivered new versions and enhancements to customers who purchase maintenance contracts  our future license revenues are substantially dependent on new customer sales 
we have recently introduced our products on a service based subscription model  but these services still consist substantially of providing our truecomp product 
in addition  substantially all of our trueinformation product sales have historically been made in connection with truecomp sales 
as a result of these factors  we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in demand for truecomp 
accordingly  if demand for truecomp and related products and services declines significantly  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
if we reduce prices or alter our payment terms to compete successfully  our margins and operating results may be adversely affected 
the intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to reduce our prices and or modify our traditional licensing revenue generation strategies in ways that may delay revenue recognition on all or a portion of our licensing transactions 
for example  we recently introduced a hosted offering of our product to be sold on a subscription basis in an effort to gain customers that are not interested in the investment of purchasing a perpetual license 
if our competitors offer deep discounts on competitive products or services  we may be required to lower prices or offer other terms more favorable to our customers in order to compete successfully 
some of our competitors may bundle their software products that compete with ours with their other products and services for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations 
these practices could  over time  limit the prices that we can charge for our products 
if we cannot offset price reductions and other terms more favorable to our customers with a corresponding increase in the number of sales or decreased spending  then the reduced revenues resulting from lower prices or revenue recognition delays would adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our products depend on the technology of third parties licensed to us and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses or errors in such software could result in increased costs or delayed sales of our products 
we license technology from several software providers for our rules engine  analytics and web viewer and we anticipate that we will continue to do so 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
some of the products we license could be difficult to replace  and developing or integrating new software with our products could require months or years of design and engineering work 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in the license of our products until equivalent technology is developed or  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
in addition  our products depend upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products  and therefore any undetected errors in these products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our 
table of contents products  delay new product introductions and or injure our reputation 
our use of additional or alternative third party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties  which could result in higher royalty payments and a loss of product differentiation 
errors in our products could be costly to correct  adversely affect our reputation and impair our ability to sell our products 
our products are complex and  accordingly  they may contain errors  or bugs  that could be detected at any point in their product life cycle 
while we continually test our products for errors and work with customers to timely identify and correct bugs  errors in our products are likely to be found in the future 
any errors could be extremely costly to correct  materially and adversely affect our reputation  and impair our ability to sell our products 
moreover  customers relying on our products to calculate and pay incentive compensation may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security vulnerabilities than customers for software products in general 
if we incur substantial costs to correct any product errors  our operating margins would be adversely affected 
because our customers depend on our software for their critical business functions  any interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  product liability suits against us  diversion of development resources  and substantially greater service and warranty costs 
our revenues might be harmed by resistance to adoption of our software by information technology departments 
some potential customers have already made a substantial investment in other third party or internally developed software designed to model  administer  analyze and report on pay for performance programs 
these companies may be reluctant to abandon these investments in favor of our software 
in addition  information technology departments of potential customers may resist purchasing our software solutions for a variety of other reasons  particularly the potential displacement of their historical role in creating and running software and concerns that packaged software products are not sufficiently customizable for their enterprises 
we recently experienced changes in our senior management team 
the loss of key personnel or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business 
during we experienced numerous changes in our executive management team  most notably the hiring of robert youngjohns as our new president and chief executive officer  shanker trivedi as our vice president  chief marketing officer  and leslie stretch as our vice president of worldwide sales 
although we do not expect similar changes in  all of our existing personnel  including our executive officers  are employed on an at will basis 
if we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our current executives or key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us  it could harm our business and our ability to successfully implement our business plan 
additionally  if we are unable to timely hire qualified replacements for our executive and other key positions  our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed 
even if we can timely hire qualified replacements  we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any transition 
we may lose sales opportunities and our business may be harmed if we do not successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships to implement and sell our products 
we have relationships with third party consulting firms  systems integrators and software vendors 
these third parties may provide us with customer referrals  cooperate with us in the design  sales and or marketing of 
table of contents our products  provide valuable insights into market demands and provide our customers with systems implementation services or overall program management 
however  we do not have formal agreements governing our ongoing relationship with certain of these third party providers and the agreements we do have generally do not include obligations with respect to generating sales opportunities or cooperating on future business 
should any of these third parties go out of business or choose not to work with us  we may be forced to develop all or a portion of those capabilities internally  incurring significant expense and adversely affecting our operating margins 
any of our third party providers may offer products of other companies  including products that compete with our products 
if we do not successfully and efficiently establish  maintain  and expand our industry relationships with influential market participants  we could lose sales and service opportunities which would adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced revenues and incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
our success and ability to compete is significantly dependent on the proprietary technology embedded in our products 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  patents  trademarks  service marks  trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect its unauthorized use 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy and or reverse engineer our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
to the extent that we engage in international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information increases 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants and with the customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or one that results in a significant damage award 
from time to time  we receive claims that our products or business infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of third parties and our competitors or other third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights 
we believe that claims of infringement are likely to increase as the functionality of our products expands and as new products are introduced 
a claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties 
if we were subject to a claim of infringement  regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses  the claim could require costly litigation to resolve  absorb significant management time  cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements  require us to discontinue the sale of all or a portion of our products  require us to indemnify our customers or third party systems integrators  or require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products 

table of contents in addition  we use a limited amount of open source software in our products and may use more in the future 
from time to time there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products 
as a result  we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software 
if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of  requires an effective planning and management process 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our system integrators and other third party service vendors and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
additionally  as we prepare to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  we may identify one or more material weaknesses in our financial controls 
the existence or disclosure of any such material weaknesses could adversely affect our stock price 
we may expand our international operations but we do not have substantial experience in international markets  and may not achieve the expected results 
we expect to expand our international operations in international expansion may require substantial financial resources and a significant amount of attention from our management 
international operations involve a variety of risks  particularly unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  taxes  trade laws and tariffs  differing ability to protect our intellectual property rights  differing labor regulations  greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products  greater difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing foreign operations  and fluctuating exchange rates 
we have limited experience in marketing  selling and supporting our products and services abroad 
if we invest substantial time and resources to grow our international operations and fail to do so successfully and timely  our business and operating results could be seriously harmed 
class action and derivative lawsuits have been filed against us and additional lawsuits may be filed 
in july  a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current directors and officers  by or on behalf of persons claiming to be our shareholders and persons claiming to have purchased or otherwise acquired our securities during the period from november  through june  in addition  in july and october  derivative lawsuits were filed in state and federal courts  respectively  against certain of our present and former executives and directors 
in february  the parties stipulated to a stay of the state derivative cases in favor of the federal derivative case 
in february  we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in the federal securities case 
in may the court granted our motion and granted plaintiffs leave to amend 
the plaintiffs declined to amend the complaint and the court thereafter entered a dismissal with prejudice on july  the remaining derivative cases are still pending and on september   plaintiffs in the federal derivative case filed an amended complaint 
the company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on october  the federal court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the amended 
table of contents complaint on march  regardless of the outcome of any of these actions  it is likely that such actions will cause a diversion of our management s time and attention 
risks related to our stock our stock price is likely to remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past and may in the future be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed in this risks related to our business section of this annual report above and in this section below 
we receive only limited attention by securities analysts  and there frequently occurs an imbalance between supply and demand in the public trading market for our common stock due to limited trading volumes 
investors should consider an investment in our common stock as risky and should only purchase our common stock if they can withstand significant losses 
other factors that affect the volatility of our stock include our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  results of operations  projections  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in our management team  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  and developments with respect to intellectual property rights 
additionally  some companies with volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action lawsuits filed against them  any future suits such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and the price of our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by us or our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall 
additional equity financings or other share issuances by us could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public trading market or in private transactions including sales by our executive officers  directors or venture capital funds or other persons or entities affiliated with our officers and directors or the perception that such additional sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to drop 
provisions in our charter documents  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms  which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting  and would not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which would require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
in addition  we are a party to a stockholder rights agreement  which effectively prohibits a person from acquiring more than subject to certain exceptions of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
furthermore  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
all of these factors make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors could choose not to negotiate with an acquirer that it does not believe is in our strategic interests 
if an acquirer is discouraged from offering to 
table of contents acquire us or prevented from successfully completing a hostile acquisition by these or other measures  you could lose the opportunity to sell your shares at a favorable price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  high quality corporate debt obligations or united states government obligations 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices  with net unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  that typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately two months and all investment securities had maturities of less than twelve months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity total total year more than principal fair or less year amount value available for sales securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
we paid all term loans in full as of december  therefore  we currently have no exposure to market risk related to our outstanding debt instruments 
to the extent we enter into or issue debt instruments in the future  we will have interest expense market risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our united kingdom  germany and australia operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from our international operations 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we expect to continue to do a majority of our business in united states dollars 
we have not entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe our foreign currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk
