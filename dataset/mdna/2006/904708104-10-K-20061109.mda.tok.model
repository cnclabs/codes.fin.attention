sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to stockholders 
operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance 
our chief operating decision maker  as defined under sfas no 
 is our chief executive officer 
we have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our chief executive officer us rental and cleaning  canadian rental and cleaning  manufacturing mfg  specialty garments rental and cleaning specialty garments  first aid and corporate 
the us rental and cleaning and canadian rental and cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for our disclosure of segment information 
the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  uniforms and protective clothing and non garment items in the united states and canada 
the operations of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our industrial laundry operations and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our industrial laundries 
the mfg operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non garment items solely for the purpose of providing these goods to the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
the amounts reflected as revenues of mfg are generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to our other locations 
these revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost 
the transfer price is determined by our management and may not necessarily represent the fair value of the products manufactured 
products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price 
on a consolidated basis  intercompany mfg revenues and mfg income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost 
income before income taxes from mfg  net of the intercompany mfg elimination  was million  million  and million for years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
this income offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from mfg at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost 
the corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center  sales and marketing  information systems  engineering  materials management  manufacturing planning  finance  budgeting  human resources  other general and administrative costs and interest expense 
the revenues generated from the corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center 
the products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
in the segment disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements  no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer 
however  depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the corporate operating segment 
the assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us 
we refer to our us and canadian rental and cleaning  mfg  and corporate segments combined as our core laundry operations 
the specialty garments operating segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  specialty garments and non garment items primarily for nuclear and clean room applications 
the first aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from us and canadian rental and cleaning  and corporate 
a key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers 
our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels 
revenues from specialty garments  which accounted for of our revenues  increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants  as garment usage increases at these times 
first aid represented of our total revenue in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation 
changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period 
inventories and rental merchandise in service our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we use the first in  first out fifo method to value our inventories  which primarily consist of finished goods 
during fiscal  we changed our accounting policy for a portion of our inventories from last in  first out lifo  to the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
this change had no impact on the consolidated statements of income for any period presented 
we believe that the fifo method is preferable to lifo because i all of our primary competitors currently use the fifo inventory method  therefore  the change will make the comparison of results among these companies more consistent ii the change is consistent with the increased emphasis on consistency between generally accepted accounting principals in the united states and international accounting standards which provide that the fifo or weighted average methods are acceptable and does not provide for the use of the lifo method iii this change will result in all of our inventories being valued consistently using the fifo method of accounting and iv due to the current low inflation levels  our inventory costs have remained fairly constant and are not expected to increase in the near future 
consistent with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  we have retroactively restated our prior financial statements 
the impact of this change increased inventories  accrued income taxes  and retained earnings approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on the august  consolidated balance sheet and increased retained earnings approximately million as of august   as presented on the consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise  which range from to months 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition  sfas no 
also requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
we complete our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there were no impairments of goodwill in fiscal  or future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with previously acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there were no material impairments of property and equipment or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal   or environmental and other contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations  including environmental matters  personal injury  customer contract matters and employment claims 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
we regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are being considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
we record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  our estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments  and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants 
the estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted using risk free interest rates ranging from to over periods ranging from ten to thirty years 
the estimated current costs  net of legal settlements with insurance carriers  have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  our estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion and analysis 
asset retirement obligations we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
under this accounting method  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
we have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we depreciate  on a straight line basis  the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately four to twenty five years 
our estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities  estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future  and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
the liability has been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates that range from approximately to over one to thirty years 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  estimated dates of decommissioning  changes in decommissioning costs  changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities  or other changes in estimates 
changes due to revisions in our estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long lived asset if the assets are still in service  or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service 
insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation  vehicles and general liability programs 
we also purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred  but have not been reported 
our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
our liabilities are based on our estimates  and  while we believe that our accruals are adequate  the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded 
changes in our claim experience  our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period 
pensions the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates 
we compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction 
we are periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  we record estimated reserves for probable exposures  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local country s currency 
transaction gains and losses  including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions  are included in selling and administrative expenses  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year 
the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

first aid revenues increased by in fiscal and specialty garments revenues decreased by in due to the conclusion of a significant contract in fiscal operating costs operating costs increased to million  or of revenues  for as compared to million  or of revenues  for the increase in costs as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to higher energy costs associated with operating our industrial laundries and our fleet of delivery vehicles 
overall merchandise costs in our core laundry business also increased as a percentage of revenues as compared to fiscal  especially in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  overall operating costs from specialty garments also increased as a percent of segment revenues due to its decrease in revenues as well as an incremental million in expense incurred in fiscal related to the decommissioning of two of its facilities 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in production payroll and payroll related costs 
the decrease in payroll related costs was primarily due to a million reduction to our insurance reserves booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting from our annual third party actuarial review  of which million was allocated to operating costs 
selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for from million  or of revenues  for the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues was primarily due to an increase in our sales force within the us and canadian rental and cleaning segment 
the growth within the sales force is the result of our continued effort to foster revenue growth 
our selling and administrative expense in fiscal also included a million charge to increase our environmental accrual for additional exposure identified during the year 
in addition  overall selling and administrative costs associated with our specialty garments segment increased as a percentage of segment revenues due to the large decrease in revenues discussed above 
these increases in selling payroll costs were partially offset by a decrease in payroll related costs attributable to a million reduction to our insurance reserves booked in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting from our annual third party actuarial review  of which million was allocated to selling and administrative costs 
in addition  we recorded a million gain from the sale of one of our industrial laundry facilities in fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percent of revenues from to 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity 
income from operations august  august  dollar percent change change in millions  except percentages core laundry operations specialty garments first aid consolidated total percentage of total revenues our income from operations decreased million to million for  from million in this change was primarily attributable to a decrease in income from operations in specialty garments of million  which was due to a decline in specialty garment revenues 
as discussed above  this decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the conclusion of a significant contract in fiscal this decrease was offset by an increase in income from operations from the core laundry operations and first aid of million and million respectively  which were primarily attributable to increases in the core laundry operations and first aid revenues of and  respectively 
other expense income other expense  which includes interest expense  interest income and interest rate swap income  increased by million to million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest expense of million 
net interest expense increased due to an increase in our average borrowings and interest rates compared to the comparable period in which resulted in an increase in the interest expense on our variable interest rate borrowings under our million credit agreement and our floating rate notes 
our average debt outstanding in was million as compared to million during the remainder of the increase was due to million of income that we booked in related to changes in the fair value of a million interest rate swap that matured in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for and for the increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to million of tax reserves booked in related to tax exposure we identified 
in addition  in fiscal we recognized a million benefit primarily attributable to the reversal of tax reserves that we determined were no longer required

in addition  our current year acquisitions contributed an additional to the increase in revenues 
the increase in revenue for was modest due to a particularly competitive pricing environment operating costs operating costs increased to million for as compared with million for however  our operating costs decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in the primary reasons for this decrease was lower merchandise amortization as a result of cost savings realized in mfg  lower merchandise amortization for the industrial laundry locations acquired as part of our textilease acquisition and lower industrial laundry production payroll costs as a percentage of revenues 
these benefits were somewhat offset by higher energy costs associated with operating our industrial laundries and our fleet of delivery trucks 
selling and administrative expense our selling and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in  or million  as compared to of revenues in  or million 
the increase in our selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in our sales force within us and canadian rental and cleaning 
the growth within the sales force was the result of our effort to foster increased revenue growth 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million  or of revenues for  as compared with million  or of revenues for the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily related to certain fixed assets we owned that became fully depreciated in fiscal  as well as certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in fiscal in us and canadian rental and cleaning and corporate 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization also relates to a charge of approximately million we recorded to depreciation in related to the write down  to net realizable value  of certain machinery and equipment at our richmond industrial laundry location that we closed during fiscal income from operations august  august  dollar percent change change in millions  except percentages core laundry operations specialty garments first aid consolidated total percentage of total revenues our income from operations increased million to million for the year ended august  as compared with million for the year ended august  this increase was primarily due to an increase in income from operations during these periods of million in us and canadian rental and cleaning and an increase of million in mfg  net of intercompany mfg elimination 
these increases were offset by an increase in loss from operations of million in corporate  and lower income from operations of million in first aid and million in specialty garments 
the increase in us and canadian rental and cleaning was due to increased revenues  lower operating costs as a percentage of revenues offset by higher selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues 
the reasons for these fluctuations in revenues and cost are discussed above 
the increase in the loss from operations in corporate is due primarily to increased payroll and other costs related to our distribution center and corporate offices offset by decreases in depreciation expense as discussed above 
the decrease in income from operations in first aid is primarily due to increased costs associated with this segment s new pill packaging facility 
other expense income our net interest expense was million  or of revenues in  as compared with million  or of revenues in the decrease in interest expense was due to a reduction in the level of our debt outstanding during the fiscal year 
our average debt outstanding in was million as compared to million in this was offset by lower income related to changes in the fair value of a million interest rate swap  which generated only million of income for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to million of income for the fiscal year ended august  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended august  and for the fiscal year ended august  this decrease is due to a million credit that we recorded in fiscal related to the reversal of tax reserves that we determined were no longer required as well as changes in the provision required for foreign taxes 
liquidity and capital resources general 
for the fiscal year ended august   we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
as of august   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit agreement defined below will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
sources and uses of cash 
during the fiscal year ended august   we generated cash from operating activities of million resulting primarily from net income of million  amounts charged for depreciation and amortization of million  increases in accounts payable and accruals of million  offset primarily by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in inventories of million  an increase in rental merchandise in service of million  and a decrease in accrued and deferred income taxes of million 
we used cash to  among other things  fund million in capital expenditures and fund the acquisition of businesses of approximately million 
our long term debt increased by approximately million as a result of million of borrowings offset by million of payments during the year ended august long term debt and borrowing capacity as of august   we had a million unsecured revolving credit agreement credit agreement  with a syndicate of banks  which matures september  loans under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates which vary based on our funded debt ratio 
under the credit agreement  we may borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or the bank s prime rate  as selected by us 
availability of credit requires our compliance with financial and other covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  maximum funded debt ratio  and minimum debt coverage  as defined in the credit agreement 
we generally test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  we were required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of million as of august  at august   the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the credit agreement ranged from libor plus basis points  or  to the prime rate  or 
as of august   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million  letters of credit of million  and million available for borrowing 
on september   we amended our credit agreement 
this new agreement amended credit agreement matures on september  and allows for maximum outstanding borrowings of million 
under the amended credit agreement  we will continue to be able to borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or the bank s prime rate  as selected by us 
availability of credit requires our compliance with certain amended financial and other covenants  including a maximum funded debt ratio and minimum interest coverage as defined in the amended credit agreement 
on june   we issued million of fixed and floating rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement note agreement 
under the note agreement  we issued million of notes with a seven year term june bearing interest at fixed rate notes 
we also issued million of floating rate notes due in ten years june floating rate notes 
of the floating rate notes  million bear interest at libor plus basis points and may be repaid at face value two years from the date they were issued 
the remaining million of floating rate notes bore interest at libor plus basis points and were repaid in september on september   we issued million of floating rates notes floating rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement note agreement 
the floating rate notes mature on september   bear interest at libor plus basis points and may be repaid at face value two years from the date of issuance 
the proceeds from the issuance of the floating rate notes were used to first repay the million of outstanding floating rate notes and then to pay down outstanding amounts under the amended credit agreement 
as of august   we were in compliance with all the covenants under the note agreement and the credit agreement 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances 
in particular  industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues  and  in the past  used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents 
we are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have  through the years  taken measures to avoid their improper disposal 
over the years  we have settled  or contributed to the settlement of  actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
we regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of outside consultants and attorneys based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
under environmental laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on  or in  or emanating from such property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our company under such laws or expose our company to third party actions such as tort suits 
we continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to woburn  massachusetts  somerville  massachusetts  springfield  massachusetts  uvalde  texas  stockton  california  three sites in williamstown  vermont  as well as number of additional locations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of textilease corporation in september we also have potential exposure related to an additional parcel of land the central area related to the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above 
currently  the consent order for the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above does not define or require any remediation work in the central area 
we have not accrued for this contingency as we believe  at this time  the liability is not probable and the amount of such contingent liability can not be reasonably estimated 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on our judgment and experience in remediation and monitoring our sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties prps who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
there is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site 
we generally use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate 
when we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable  we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using risk free interest rates ranging from to 
for environmental liabilities that have been discounted  we include interest accretion  based on the effective interest method  within operating costs on the consolidated statement of income 
the changes to our environmental liabilities for the years ended august  and august  are as follows in thousands year ended august  august  beginning balance costs incurred for which reserves have been provided insurance proceeds received interest accretion revisions in estimates balance as of august  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made an adjustment to increase our environmental related accrual by million due to preliminary results of our ongoing site investigation at one of our environmental exposure sites 
anticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of august  for the next five years and thereafter as measured in current dollars are reflected below 
in thousands thereafter total estimated costs current dollars estimated insurance proceeds net anticipated costs effect of inflation effect of discounting balance as of august  estimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of our legal settlement with an insurance company 
annual proceeds of approximately million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for three sites related to our former operations in williamstown  vermont 
annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year as of august  the balance in this escrow account  which is held in a trust and is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  was approximately million 
also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at the site in uvalde  texas 
our nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  or  in certain cases  by the applicable state agency  and are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
there can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business 
from time to time  we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations  including litigation related to charges for certain ancillary services on invoices  personal injury claims  customer contract matters  employment claims and environmental matters as described above 
while it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities  including lawsuits and environmental contingencies  we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities  if any  in excess of amounts we have accrued or are covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that our future financial position and or results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control 
acquisitions as part of our business  we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies 
in recent years  we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future 
to pay for an acquisition  we may use cash on hand  cash generated from operations or borrowings under our credit agreement  or we may pursue other forms of debt financing 
our ability to secure short term and long term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability  our levels of debt and equity  and the overall credit and equity market environments 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following information is presented as of august  payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years private placement revolving credit agreement other debt total debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations as discussed above under long term debt and borrowing capacity  as of august   we had borrowing capacity of million under our credit agreement  of which approximately million was available for borrowing 
also  as of such date  we had outstanding borrowings of million included in bank debt in the above schedule and letters of credit of million 
all letters of credit expire in less than one year 
during september  the company amended its credit agreement to  among other things  increase its borrowing capacity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details 
seasonality historically  our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations have been due to a number of factors  including general economic conditions in our markets  the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start up operations and related costs  our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start up operations  the timing of nuclear plant outages  capital expenditures  seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers  and price changes in response to competitive factors 
in addition  our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year 
the operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods 
effects of inflation in general  we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
significant increases in energy costs  specifically natural gas and gasoline  can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
currently  energy costs represent approximately of our total revenue

on july   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  which fundamentally changes the way that we will be required to treat our uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes 
fin no 
prescribes rules regarding how we should recognize  measure and disclose in our financial statements tax positions that were taken or we will be taking on our tax return that are reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable  or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we are currently evaluating the impact it will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have determined that all of our foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of the subsidiaries 
all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year 
as such  our financial condition and operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries 
revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented approximately  and of our total consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
total assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented approximately of our total consolidated assets for each of the fiscal years ended august   august  and august  if exchange rates had changed by from the actual rates in effect during the year ended august   our revenues and assets for the year ended and as of august  would have changed by approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant change in the value of our foreign subsidiaries functional currencies  which include the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  and mexican peso  as compared to the us dollar 
any gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions  including exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany accounts are reported as transaction gains losses in our selling and administrative expenses 
the intercompany payables and receivables are denominated in canadian dollars  euros  british pounds and mexican pesos 
during the year ended august  transaction gains losses included in selling and administrative expenses were million 
if the exchange rates had changed by during the year ended august   we would have recognized an exchange gain or loss of approximately million 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage these exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our million credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and our floating rate notes which were purchased by a group of insurance companies pursuant to a note purchase agreement 
under both agreements  we borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or libor rates 
if the libor and eurodollar rates fluctuated by from the actual rates in effect during the year ended august   our interest expense would have fluctuated by approximately million from the interest expense recognized for the year ended august
