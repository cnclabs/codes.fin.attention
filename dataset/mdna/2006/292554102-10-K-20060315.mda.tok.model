item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and financial results improved during the year ended december  as compared to prior years 
highlights for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  are as follows gross collections on receivable portfolios increased to million revenues increased to million net income increased to million we attribute these improvements to stronger collections  disciplined purchasing and our multiple collection strategies 
we believe that the markets for unsecured charged off consumer debt have become more competitive 
this has increased and  we believe  will continue to increase the pricing of portfolios 
we are continuing to diversify our acquisition of portfolios into other categories that are somewhat less competitive 

table of contents we have improved our financial position as a result of our recent operating performance during our stockholders equity was million as of december   an increase of million from the million in stockholders equity as of december  this increase is primarily attributable to net income of million  issuance of common stock of million and the sale of warrants associated with the convertible notes as defined below of million  net of the purchase of call options associated with the convertible notes of million 
in addition  we had unrestricted cash of million as of december   after borrowing million and repaying million in principal on our debt facilities and purchasing million in receivable portfolios  which includes million of receivable portfolios acquired in connection with the jefferson capital acquisition 
we repaid million  and million in debt principal during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our strong financial condition and sound operating performance have also allowed us to obtain a new amendment to our revolving credit facility which currently allows us to borrow up to million  though we have the ability to increase the facility to million  reduce the interest spreads and incur certain additional indebtedness 
unlike our secured financing facility  the amended revolving credit facility does not require us to share with the lender the residual collections on the portfolios financed 
in addition  this facility carries a lower base rate of interest 
accordingly  as we replace borrowings under our secured financing facility with our revolving credit facility  our interest costs should decline 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our new revolving credit facility 
jefferson capital acquisition on june   we acquired certain assets  including receivable portfolios  from jefferson capital systems  llc jefferson capital  a subsidiary of compucredit corporation for cash consideration totaling million 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired a portfolio of charged off consumer credit card debt with a face value of approximately billion  entered into a forward flow agreement to purchase a minimum of billion in face value of credit card charge offs from jefferson capital over a five year period at a fixed price and entered into an agreement to offer employment to approximately employees of jefferson capital at our new collection site in st 
cloud  minnesota  after the completion of a three month transition services agreement with jefferson capital 
in addition  we entered into a two year agreement to sell chapter bankruptcies to jefferson capital based on a pre set pricing schedule and agreed to provide jefferson capital with a prescribed number of accounts on a monthly basis for its balance transfer program  also based on a pre set pricing schedule 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the acquisition of certain assets from jefferson capital 
ascension capital acquisition on august   we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of ascension capital group  ltd 
ascension capital for consideration totaling million plus acquisition related costs of million 
in addition  we deposited million in an escrow in connection with the execution of a three year employment contract with a key executive of ascension capital 
we are expensing the million as compensation expense ratably over three years 
if the executive voluntarily departs without good reason or is terminated for cause  any unapplied funds from the escrow will be returned to us 
based in arlington  texas  ascension capital is a provider of bankruptcy services to the finance industry 
their services include  among others  negotiating bankruptcy plans  monitoring and managing the consumer s compliance with bankruptcy plans  and recommending courses of action to clients when there is a deviation from a bankruptcy plan

convertible senior notes in september  we issued million of convertible senior notes due september  convertible notes 
as part of the offering  we granted the underwriters of the offering an option  solely to 
table of contents cover over allotments  to purchase up to an additional aggregate million principal amount of the convertible notes 
this option was exercised in full in october interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  commencing march  the convertible notes rank equally with our existing and future senior indebtedness and are senior to our future subordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes are convertible prior to maturity  subject to certain conditions described below  into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes 
as issued  the convertible notes required physical settlement in shares of our common stock at the time of conversion 
in october we obtained stockholder approval of a net share settlement feature that allows us to settle conversion of the convertible notes through a combination of cash and stock 
based on the provisions of eitf and eitf  the settlement feature is accounted for as convertible debt and is not subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
as a result of the net settlement feature we will be able to substantially reduce the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes by repaying principal in cash instead of issuing shares of common stock for that amount 
additionally  we will not be required to include the underlying shares of common stock in the calculation of our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for earnings per share until our stock price exceeds the aggregate underwriting commissions and other debt issuance costs incurred with respect to the issuance of the convertible notes were million  which have been capitalized as debt issuance costs on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition and are being amortized on an effective interest rate method over the term of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes also contain a restricted convertibility feature that does not affect the conversion price of the convertible notes but  instead  places restrictions on a holder s ability to convert their convertible notes into shares of our common stock 
a holder may convert the convertible notes prior to march  only if one or more of the following conditions are satisfied the average of the trading prices of the convertible notes for any five consecutive trading day period is less than of the average of the conversion values of the convertible notes during that period  we make certain significant distributions to our holders of common stock  we enter into specified corporate transactions  or our common stock ceases to be approved for listing on the nasdaq national market and is not listed for trading on a us national securities exchange or any similar us system of automated securities price dissemination 
holders also may surrender their convertible notes for conversion anytime on or after march  until the close of business on the trading day immediately preceding september   regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied 
upon the satisfaction of any of the foregoing conditions as of the last day of the reporting period  or during the twelve months prior to september   we would write off to expense all remaining unamortized debt issuance costs 
if the convertible notes are converted in connection with certain fundamental changes that occur prior to march   we may be obligated to pay an additional make whole premium with respect to the convertible notes so converted 
convertible note hedge strategy 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes in september and october  we purchased call options to purchase from the counterparties an aggregate  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the cost of the call options totaled approximately million 
we also sold warrants to purchase from us an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a 
table of contents price of per share and received net proceeds from the sale of these warrants of million 
taken together  the convertible note hedge and warrant agreements have the effect of increasing the effective conversion price of the convertible notes to per share 
the call options  as issued  required physical settlement in shares 
as discussed above  in october  the company obtained stockholder approval of a net share settlement feature for the convertible notes which in turn resulted in a modification of the call options to net share settlement 
the warrants must be settled in net shares which means that if the market price per share of our common stock is above per share  we will be required to deliver shares of our common stock representing the value of the warrants in excess of per share 
the warrants are generally exercisable at anytime 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  we recorded the call options and warrants in additional paid in capital and will not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the call options and warrants in our financial statements

these increases were offset in part by lower effective accretion rates resulting from a more competitive pricing environment and the recording of a million impairment 
table of contents provision 
the impairment was recorded on certain pool groups acquired in   and the to pool groups have high effective interest rates and estimated collection multiples ranging from to and accordingly  collection shortfalls relative to forecast during the year ended december  resulted in impairments see supplemental performance data 
the impairment on the pool group was the result of lower than expected collections related to very old automotive deficiencies that were in excess of months from charge off at the time of purchase  and from charged off commercial gas credit cards for which we were unable to receive personal guarantor information from the issuer 
we may be able to partially or fully reverse the impairment through the valuation allowances for these pool groups by experiencing higher than expected collections  or in the case of the commercial gas card portfolio  receiving replacement accounts or receiving a partial cash refund of the purchase price 
of the increase in revenues  million is related to bankruptcy servicing revenue associated with our acquisition of ascension capital

the increase in the commission rate as a percentage of the related gross collections was primarily due to the mix of accounts placed with the agencies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily a result of a million increase in legal costs relating to litigation defense and other corporate matters and a million increase in rent expense due to the relocation of our san diego operations to a larger facility as well as the addition of the jefferson capital and ascension capital office facilities 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in insurance expense of approximately million resulting primarily from a decrease in our workers compensation reserves

we make estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we record a portion of the estimated future residual collections sharing obligation as contingent interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in contingent interest recorded under the terms of our secured financing facility offset by an increase in interest expense associated with additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and with the issuance of our convertible senior notes

changes in the investment in receivable portfolios revenue related to our investment in receivable portfolios is comprised of two groups first  revenue from those portfolios that have a remaining book value and are accounted for on the accrual basis accrual basis portfolios  and second  revenue from those portfolios that have fully recovered their book value zero basis portfolios and  therefore  every dollar of gross collections is recorded entirely as zero basis revenue

table of contents analysis of changes in receivable portfolios revenue the following table analyzes the components of the increase in revenue from our receivable portfolios between the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december  variance component change revenue variance average portfolio balance weighted average effective interest rate zero basis portfolios retained interest revenue total variance for the years ended december  variance component change revenue variance average portfolio balance weighted average effective interest rate zero basis portfolios retained interest revenue total variance revenue trends our revenue is primarily comprised of accretion revenue and zero basis revenue 
accretion revenue represents revenue derived from pools with a cost basis that has not been fully amortized 
revenue from receivable portfolios with a remaining unamortized cost basis is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s remaining unamortized cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
we account for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for certain debt securities acquired in a transfer sop  which is discussed below 
for revenue recognition purposes  portfolios can be divided into two groups accrual basis portfolios those that still have a remaining unamortized basis  and zero basis portfolios those portfolios for which the cost basis has been completely amortized 
zero basis revenue represents revenue derived from receivable portfolios whose cost basis has been fully amortized 
when there is no remaining cost basis to amortize  each dollar collected is recognized entirely as revenue 
during the year ended december   million which is exclusive of the million of zero basis revenue on the retained interest was recognized as zero basis revenue  a million decrease from the million recognized during the year ended december  the revenue from these portfolios is expected to decline in future quarters as collections from these portfolios diminish 
our net revenue to gross collections percentage on our receivable portfolios was during the year ended december  compared to revenue to collections percentage of for the period from january  through december  the higher revenue to collections percentage during the year is the result of the impact of our collection forecast revaluations implemented in past periods  which increased the collection 
table of contents forecasts for many of our older portfolios  thus increasing the internal rates of returns for those pools 
this was partially offset by lower revenue to collections percentages on recently acquired receivable portfolios resulting from a more competitive pricing environment and the corresponding lower internal rates of return of those portfolios 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more discussion on our investment in receivable portfolios 
the proportion of zero basis portfolios and our older higher yielding portfolios will decrease in the future and accordingly the quarterly revenue to collections percentage is expected to decline in future periods 
the graph below depicts the quarterly revenue to collections percentage and the life to date revenue to collections percentage for our receivable portfolios 
percentage of revenue to gross collections logo prior to january   we accounted for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method under the provisions of the aicpa s practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
commencing january   we began accounting for our investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of sop sop addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
sop limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over our investment in the pool 
the effective interest rate applied to the cost basis of the pool is to remain level  or static throughout the life of the pool unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of a pool s effective interest rate over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the effective interest rate  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool and are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a reduction in revenue with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios on the consolidated statement of financial condition 
as permitted by sop  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios 
table of contents are assigned to the pool permanently 
the discount  which is the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance  is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool  similar to one loan  for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to principal of receivable portfolios  and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return as derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool

purchases from seller were conducted under a forward flow arrangement 
as announced in our press release dated january   this arrangement was not renewed for liquidity and capital resources overview historically  we have met our cash requirements by utilizing our cash flows from operations  bank borrowings  and equity offerings 
our primary cash requirements have included the purchase of receivable portfolios  operational expenses  the payment of interest and the repayment of principal on bank borrowings  and tax payments 
our strong operating performance combined with our equity offerings have resulted in an increase in stockholders equity to million as of december  from million as of december   and million as of december  in addition  we had an unrestricted cash balance of million at december   after borrowing million and repaying million in principal on our debt facilities and purchasing in receivable portfolios  which includes million of receivable portfolios acquired in connection with the jefferson capital acquisition 
effective august   we finalized the terms of our million revolving credit facility 
this facility will be used for future receivable portfolio purchases and for working capital needs 
at december   of the million commitment  our outstanding balance was million and our aggregate borrowing base was million  of which million was available for future borrowings 
in september  we issued million of convertible senior notes due september  the convertible notes 
as part of the offering  we granted the initial purchasers of the convertible notes an option  solely to cover over allotments  to purchase up to an additional aggregate million principal amount of the convertible notes 
this option was exercised in full in october proceeds from the convertible notes were used to pay down approximately million of outstanding indebtedness on the revolving credit facility 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  commencing march  
table of contents as issued  the convertible notes required physical settlement in shares of our common stock at the time of conversion 
in october  we obtained stockholder approval of a net share settlement feature that allows us to settle conversion of the notes through a combination of cash and stock 
as a result of the net share settlement feature  we will be able to substantially reduce the number of shares issuable in the event of the conversion of the convertible notes by repaying principal in cash instead of issuing shares of common stock for that amount 
additionally  we will not be required to include the underlying shares of common stock in the calculation of our diluted weighted average shares outstanding for earnings per share until our common stock price exceeds 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes in september and october  we purchased call options to purchase from counterparties an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the cost of the call options totaled million 
we also sold warrants to the same counterparties to purchase from us an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and received net proceeds from the sale of these warrants of million

table of contents critical accounting policies investment in receivable portfolios 
prior to january   we accounted for its investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method under the provisions of the aicpa s practice bulletin  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans 
commencing january   we began accounting for its investment in receivable portfolios utilizing the interest method in accordance with the provisions of sop sop addresses accounting for differences between initial estimated cash flows expected to be collected from purchased receivables  or pools  and subsequent changes to those estimated cash flows 
sop limits the revenue that may be accreted  also known as accretable yield  to the excess of the estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected over our investment  or cost basis  in the pool 
the effective interest rate applied to the cost basis of the pool is remain level  or static throughout its life unless there is an increase in subsequent expected cash flows 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally are recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the pool s effective interest rate over its remaining life 
subsequent decreases in expected cash flows do not change the effective interest rate  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the pool  and are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a reduction in revenue with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the investment in receivable portfolios in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
as permitted by sop  static pools are established on a quarterly basis with accounts purchased during the quarter that have common risk characteristics 
discrete receivable portfolio purchases during a quarter are aggregated into pools based on these common risk characteristics 
once a static pool is established  the portfolios are permanently assigned to the pool 
the discount ie  the difference between the cost of each static pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because we expect to collect a relatively small percentage of each static pool s contractual receivable balance 
as a result  receivable portfolios are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition 
upon adoption of sop  all portfolios with common risk characteristics purchased prior to the adoption of sop were aggregated by quarter of purchase 
we account for each static pool as a unit for the economic life of the pool similar to one loan for recognition of revenue from receivable portfolios  for collections applied to the cost basis of receivable portfolios and for provision for loss or impairment 
revenue from receivable portfolios is accrued based on each pool s effective interest rate applied to each pool s adjusted cost basis 
the cost basis of each pool is increased by revenue earned and decreased by gross collections and impairments 
the effective interest rate is the internal rate of return derived from the timing and amounts of actual cash received and anticipated future cash flow projections for each pool 
collections realized after the net book value of a portfolio has been fully recovered zero basis portfolios are recorded as revenue zero basis revenue 
contingent interest 
under the terms of the our secured financing facility  once we repay the lender for the notes for each purchased portfolio and collect sufficient amounts to recoup its initial cash investment in each purchased portfolio  then we share the residual collections contingent interest from the receivable portfolios  net of its servicing fees  with the lender 
we make estimates with respect to the timing and amount of collections of future cash flows from these receivable portfolios 
based on these estimates  we record a portion of the estimated future profit sharing obligation as contingent interest expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on contingent interest 
deferred revenue 
on august   we acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of ascension capital 
ascension capital provides bankruptcy administration services primarily to holders of motor vehicle secured loans on which the debtor has filed for chapter or bankruptcy 
these services are provided subject to the terms of long term contracts 
such contracts generally have initial terms of one or two years and automatically renew subsequently for yearly periods 
fees for the bankruptcy administration services are charged on a per referred account basis and generally consist of an upfront fee at the 
table of contents time of account referral 
this initial fee is typically coupled with either an ongoing monthly service fee per referred account or service specific fees based on a predetermined fee schedule 
the servicing deliverable for chapter accounts is focused on the completion of the bankruptcy process as a whole to the most favorable possible conclusion for the customer 
as a result  revenue is deferred and not recognized until the bankruptcy case is closed dismissal discharge 
due to practical limitations and constraints  a historical average life of seven months is used instead of actual closure dates 
therefore  the total arrangement consideration less litigation for client contracts without a separate litigation fee schedule will be recognized seven months after a referred account is activated 
chapter bankruptcy proceedings  also known as reorganization  are generally designed to restructure an individual s debts and allow them to propose a repayment plan detailing how they are going to pay back their debts over the plan period 
the responsibility of ascension capital is to ensure the client claim is recognized by the court to the maximum benefit of the ascension capital customer and to monitor and or collect the debtor payments throughout the confirmed bankruptcy plan term 
the average duration period ascension capital services chapter bankruptcy is thirty five months 
given the nature and duration of a chapter proceeding  the monthly servicing deliverable provided relative to a chapter referred account is considered delivered each month and revenue is ratably recognized  including any upfront fees received by the company over time as the services are provided 
the litigation deliverable is an as incurred event with revenue recognized based on the historical percentage of accounts litigated over the average duration of an account 
any billings in excess of the ratable revenue will be deferred 
the average duration period for chapter bankruptcy will be periodically reviewed for changes

forward flow asset 
in connection with our acquisition of a business in june see note of the consolidated financial statements  we entered into a forward flow agreement to purchase a minimum of billion in face value of credit card charge offs over the next five years at a fixed price 
we allocated million of the acquisition purchase price to this agreement  which is reflected on the consolidated statement of financial condition as forward flow asset 
we allocate a portion of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolio purchases under the forward flow agreement based on the proportion the purchase represents to the total purchase commitment  as adjusted for the time value of money 
we allocated million of the forward flow asset to the cost basis of receivable portfolios purchased during the year ended december  as part of this forward flow agreement  the seller is obligated to sell a predetermined minimum amount of charged off credit card accounts to us 
the forward flow agreement contains penalty provisions if the seller fails to meet such minimum requirements 
any monies received pursuant to such penalty provisions would be applied to the carrying balance of the forward flow asset 
we routinely evaluate the forward flow asset carrying balance for impairment 
deferred court costs 
we contract with a nationwide network of attorneys that specialize in collection matters 
we generally refer charged off accounts to our contracted attorneys when we believe the related debtor has sufficient assets to repay the indebtedness and has to date been unwilling to pay 
in connection with our agreements with our contracted attorneys  we advance certain out of pocket court costs deferred court costs 
we capitalize these costs in our consolidated financial statements and provide a reserve for those costs that we believe will be ultimately uncollectible 
we determine the reserve based on our analysis of court costs that have been advanced  recovered  and that we anticipate recovering 
income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using 
table of contents enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods and services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and accordingly  we expect to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in the first quarter of for periods prior to implementation  we have retained our accounting for stock based employee compensation under apb no 
and have only adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
we expect that the adoption of this statement will reduce our reported net income and earnings per share 
the effect of adopting this statement on our historical consolidated statements of operations is reflected on a proforma basis in the stock based compensation section contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
special note on forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities and exchange act  as amended the exchange act 
many statements  other than statements of historical facts  included or incorporated into this annual report on form k are forward looking statements 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  and similar expressions often characterize forward looking statements 
these statements may include  but are not limited to  projections of collections  revenues  income or loss  estimates of capital expenditures  plans for future operations  products or services  and financing needs or plans  as well as assumptions relating to these matters 
in particular  these statements may be found  among other places  under the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  business  and risk factors sections 
future and actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  risk and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control or cannot be predicted or quantified 
many factors  including but not limited to those set forth in this annual report on form k under risk factors  could cause our actual results  performance  achievements  or industry results to be very different from the results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date the statement was made 
we are under no obligation  nor do we intend  to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new information or future events  or for any other reason 
in addition  it is our policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings  and we do not endorse projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties 
item a qu antitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings 
as of december   we had total variable rate borrowings of million  which consisted of our secured 
table of contents financing facility and our revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of debt 
changes in short term interest rates also affect our earnings as a result of our borrowings under variable rate borrowing agreements 
if the market interest rates for our variable rate agreements increase at an average of  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on the amount of related outstanding borrowings as of december  of million 
conversely  if market interest rates decreased an average of  our interest expense would decrease  thereby increasing income before income taxes by approximately million  on an annualized basis  based on borrowings as of december
