marketing programs all company owned and franchised papa john s restaurants within a co developed market are required to join an area advertising cooperative co op 
each member restaurant contributes a percentage of sales to the co op for market wide programs  such as radio  television and print advertising 
the rate of contribution and uses of the monies collected are determined by a majority vote of the co op s members 
the restaurant level and co op marketing efforts are supported by print and electronic advertising materials that are produced by the papa john s marketing fund  inc  a non profit corporation the marketing fund 
the marketing fund produces and buys air time for papa john s national television commercials  in addition to other brand building activities  such as consumer research and public relations activities 
all domestic company owned and franchised papa john s restaurants are required to contribute a certain percentage of sales to the marketing fund 
the contribution rate to the marketing fund can be increased above the required contribution rate if a majority of the domestic restaurants agree to such increase 
the contribution percentage was during  for the period june through december  and from january through may and throughout effective at the beginning of fiscal  the contribution percentage to the marketing fund increased to and is expected to remain at that level throughout restaurant level marketing programs target the delivery area of each restaurant  making extensive use of targeted print materials in direct mail and store to door couponing 
the local marketing efforts also include a variety of community oriented activities with schools  sports teams and other organizations 
in markets in which papa john s has a significant presence  local marketing efforts are supplemented with radio and television advertising 
we provide both company owned and franchised restaurants with pre approved print marketing materials and with catalogs for the purchase of uniforms and promotional items 
we also provide direct marketing services to company owned and franchised restaurants using customer information gathered by our proprietary point of sale technology see company operations point of sale technology 
we have developed a system by which all domestic papa john s restaurant customers are able to place orders online via the internet  including a new plan ahead ordering advance ordering feature 
we receive a percentage fee based on online sales from domestic franchisees  in addition to royalties  for this service 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase a reloadable gift card  papa card that can be purchased in any denomination from to we also offer papa cards for sale to consumers in limited third party outlets and continue to explore additional papa card distribution opportunities 
the papa card may be redeemed for delivery  carryout and online orders and is accepted at substantially all papa john s traditional us restaurants 
company operations restaurant personnel 
a typical papa john s restaurant employs a restaurant manager  one or two assistant managers and approximately to hourly team members  most of whom work part time 
the manager is responsible for the day to day operation of the restaurant and maintaining company established operating standards 
the operating standards and other resources are contained in a comprehensive operations manual supplied to each restaurant 
we seek to hire experienced restaurant managers and staff  provide comprehensive training on operations and managerial skills  and motivate and retain them by providing opportunities for advancement and performance based financial incentives 
we also employ directors of operations who are responsible for overseeing an average of seven company owned restaurants 
the directors of operations report to operations vice presidents who are individually responsible for the management of approximately company owned restaurants in specific geographic regions 
these team members are eligible to earn performance based financial incentives

point of sale technology 
point of sale technology our proprietary profit system tm is in place in all domestic traditional papa john s restaurants and in a majority of papa john s international restaurants 
we believe this technology facilitates faster and more accurate order taking and pricing  reduces paperwork and allows the restaurant manager to better monitor and control food and labor costs 
we believe the profit system enhances restaurant level marketing capabilities through the development of a database containing information on customers and their buying habits with respect to our products 
polling capabilities allow us to obtain restaurant operating information  thereby improving the speed  accuracy and efficiency of restaurant level reporting 
during  we introduced a new generation of the profit system to the domestic and international papa john s system 
this updated version was designed to improve operational efficiencies at the restaurant level and improve our data collection process 
the updated profit system was installed in all domestic company owned and franchised restaurants during the profit system is also closely integrated with our online ordering system in all domestic traditional papa john s restaurants 
this enables papa john s to offer nationwide online ordering to our customers

we will continue to evaluate further joint venture arrangements on an individual basis as opportunities arise 
hours of operations 
our domestic restaurants are open seven days a week  typically from am to am monday through thursday  am to am on friday and saturday and noon to am on sunday 
franchise program general 
we continue to attract franchisees with significant restaurant and retail experience 
we consider our franchisees to be a vital part of our system s continued growth and believe our relationship with our franchisees is good 
as of december   there were  franchised papa john s restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  the us virgin islands  puerto rico and countries  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants operating in the united kingdom 
as of december   we have development agreements with our franchisees for approximately additional domestic franchised restaurants committed to open through and agreements for additional international franchised restaurants to open through there can be no assurance that all of these restaurants will be opened or that the development schedule set forth in the development agreements will be achieved 
during  domestic and international franchised papa john s restaurants were opened  and six perfect pizza franchised restaurants were opened 
our franchisees have converted perfect pizza restaurants to papa john s restaurants since approval 
franchisees are approved on the basis of the applicant s business background  restaurant operating experience and financial resources 
we seek franchisees to enter into development agreements for single or multiple restaurants 
we require the franchisee to either complete our training program or to hire a full time operator who completes the training and has either an equity interest or the right to acquire an equity interest in the franchise operation 
development and franchise agreements 
we enter into development agreements with our domestic franchisees for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area 
under our current standard development agreement  the franchisee is required to pay  at the time of signing the agreement  a non refundable fee of  for the first restaurant and  for any additional restaurants 
the non refundable fee is credited against the standard  franchise fee payable to us upon signing the franchise agreement for a specific location 
generally  a franchise agreement is executed when a franchisee secures a location 
our standard domestic franchise agreement provides for a term of ten years with one ten year renewal option and payment to us of a royalty fee of of sales 
substantially all existing franchise agreements permit us to increase the royalty fee up to of sales 
the royalty fee cannot be increased to an amount greater than the percentage royalty fee then in effect for new franchisees 
we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement for a variety of reasons  including a franchisee s failure to make payments when due or failure to adhere to our policies and standards 
many state franchise laws limit the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise 
we opened our first franchised restaurant outside the united states in we define international to be all markets outside the contiguous united states in which we have either a development agreement or a master franchise agreement with a franchisee for the opening of a specified number of restaurants within a defined period of time and specified geographic area 
under a master franchise agreement  the franchisee has the right to subfranchise a portion of the development to one or more subfranchisees approved by us 
under our current standard international development agreement except for hawaii and alaska  in which the initial fees are the same as domestic restaurants  the franchisee is required to pay total fees of  per restaurant   at the time of signing the agreement  and  when the restaurant opens or the agreed upon development date  whichever comes first 
under our current standard master franchise agreement  the master franchisee is required to pay total fees of  per restaurant owned and operated by the master franchisee  under the same terms as the development agreement  and  for each subfranchised restaurant   at the time of signing the agreement and  when the restaurant opens or the agreed upon development date  whichever comes first 
our current standard international master franchise and development agreements provide for payment to us of a royalty fee of of sales of sales by subfranchised restaurants  with no provision for increase 
the remaining terms applicable to the operation of individual restaurants are substantially equivalent to the terms of our standard domestic franchise agreement 
from time to time  development agreements will be negotiated at other than standard terms for fees and royalties 
we have entered into a limited number of development and franchise agreements for non traditional restaurant units and continue to analyze opportunities to expand these types of units 
these agreements generally cover venues or areas not originally targeted for development and have terms differing from the standard agreement 
these agreements have not had a significant impact on our revenues or earnings 
franchise restaurant development 
we provide assistance to papa john s franchisees in selecting sites  developing restaurants and evaluating the physical specifications for typical restaurants 
each franchisee is responsible for selecting the location for its restaurants but must obtain our approval of restaurant design and location based on accessibility and visibility of the site and targeted demographic factors  including population  density  income  age and traffic 
our domestic franchisees may purchase complete new store equipment packages through an approved third party supplier under a commission arrangement with the company 
internationally  our franchisees buy their equipment from approved third party suppliers 
franchisee loans 
selected franchisees have borrowed funds from our subsidiary  capital delivery  ltd  principally for use in the construction and development of their restaurants 
we have also entered into loan agreements with certain franchisees that purchased restaurants from us or other franchisees 
loans made to franchisees typically bear interest at fixed or floating rates with a stated average interest rate of at december  and in most cases are secured by the fixtures  equipment and signage and where applicable  the land of the restaurant and the ownership interests in the franchisee 
at december   franchisee loans outstanding totaled million million of net loans were eliminated upon consolidating franchisee variable interest entities or vies  net of a million reserve for uncollectible amounts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have a commitment to lend up to million to bibp  a franchisee owned corporation 
we have an outstanding loan of million to bibp at december   which is eliminated in consolidation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
franchise insurance program 
our franchisees have the opportunity to purchase various insurance policies  such as non owned automobile and workers compensation  through our insurance agency  risk services corp 
risk services 
in october  we established a captive insurance company captive located in bermuda  rsc insurance services  ltd  to accommodate this business 
beginning in october  a third party commercial insurance company began providing fully insured coverage to franchisees participating in the franchise insurance program 
accordingly  this new agreement eliminates our risk of loss for franchise insurance coverage written after september as of december   approximately of domestic franchise restaurants had obtained insurance coverage through risk services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
franchise training and support 
during late  the field support structure for domestic franchisees was reorganized and merged into the company owned restaurant management structure 
the new field support structure consists of franchise business directors fbds  each of whom is responsible for serving an average of approximately franchise units 
every franchisee is required to have a principal operator approved by us who satisfactorily completes our required training program and who devotes his or her full business time and efforts to the operation of the franchisee s restaurants 
each franchise restaurant manager is also required to complete our company certified management training program 
domestically  we provide an on site training crew three days before and three days after the opening of a franchisee s first two restaurants 
internationally  we provide an on site training crew five days before and five days after the opening of a franchisee s first two stores 
ongoing supervision of training is monitored by the franchise training team 
multi unit franchisees are encouraged to appoint training store general managers or hire a full time training coordinator certified to deliver company approved programs in order to train new team members and management candidates for their restaurants 
our fbd s maintain open communication with the franchise community  relaying operating and marketing information and new ideas between franchisees and us 
internationally  training is monitored by our international director of training as well as regional directors and international business managers assigned to specific franchisee territories 
we also maintain communications with our franchisees through periodic system wide meetings and newsletters 
franchise operations 
all franchisees are required to operate their papa john s restaurants in compliance with our policies  standards and specifications  including matters such as menu items  ingredients  materials  supplies  services  fixtures  furnishings  decor and signs 
each franchisee has full discretion to determine the prices to be charged to its customers 
franchise advisory council 
we have a franchise advisory council that consists of company and franchisee representatives of domestically owned restaurants 
the advisory council and subcommittees hold regular meetings to discuss new marketing ideas  operations  growth and other relevant issues 
in addition  the company is aware that certain franchisees have formed an operators exchange group for the purpose of communicating and addressing issues  needs and opportunities among its members and the company 
we currently communicate with  and receive input from  our franchisees in several forms  including through the company s franchise advisory council  annual operations conferences and various regional meetings conducted with franchisees throughout the year and participation in an operators exchange best practices forum in which numerous franchisees also participate 
we are committed to communicating with  and receiving input from  our franchisees 
reporting and business processes 
we collect sales and other operating information from domestic papa john s franchisees daily 
we have agreements with substantially all papa john s domestic franchisees permitting us to debit electronically the franchisees bank accounts for substantially all payments to us including the payment of royalties  marketing fund contributions  risk management services  and purchases from our print and promotions operations and qc centers 
this system significantly reduces the resources needed to process receivables  improves cash flow and mitigates the amount of past due accounts related to these items 
domestic franchisees generally are required to purchase and install the papa john s profit system in their restaurants see company operations point of sale technology 
industry and competition the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price  service  location  food quality and variety 
there are many well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than papa john s 
competitors include a large number of international  national and regional restaurant chains  as well as local pizza operators 
some of our competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than us and may have higher restaurant penetration and stronger  more developed brand awareness in the markets where our restaurants are  or may be located 
based on independent third party research  the united states quick service restaurant qsr pizza category  which includes dine in  carry out and delivery  had sales of approximately billion in  of which papa john s share was reported as 
within the pizza segment of the restaurant industry  we believe our primary competitors are the national pizza chains  including pizza hut  domino s and little caesars  and several regional chains  including chains executing a take and bake concept 
a change in the pricing or other marketing strategies of one or more of our competitors could have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings 
additionally  a continued increased emphasis on drive thru  carryout and curbside pickup availability by casual dining restaurants  such as applebee s and outback  as well as improved quality of fresh and frozen supermarket offerings  could also have an adverse impact on our sales and earnings 
with respect to the sale of franchises  we compete with many franchisors of restaurants and other business concepts 
in general  there is also active competition for management personnel and attractive commercial real estate sites suitable for our restaurants 
government regulation we  along with our franchisees  are subject to various federal  state and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses 
each papa john s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities  which include health  safety  sanitation  building and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
difficulties in obtaining  or the failure to obtain  required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area 
our full service qc centers are licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes  and the operation of our trucks is subject to department of transportation regulations 
we are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal trade commission ftc regulation and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
several state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor franchisee relationship 
the ftc requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular containing prescribed information 
substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states  and bills have been introduced in congress from time to time  which would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor franchisee relationship in certain respects 
the state laws often limit  among other things  the duration and scope of non competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise 
some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor franchisee relationship 
further government initiatives  such as living wage or other proposed increases in minimum wage rates  could adversely affect papa john s as well as the restaurant industry 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where franchised units are established 
trademarks our rights in our principal trademarks and service marks are a significant part of our business 
we are the owner of the federal registration of the trademark papa john s 
we have also registered pizza papa john s and design our logo  better ingredients 
better pizza 
and pizza papa john s better ingredients 
better pizza 
and design as trademarks and service marks 
we also own federal registrations for several ancillary marks  principally advertising slogans 
we have also applied to register our primary trademark  pizza papa john s and design  in more than foreign countries and the european community 
we are aware of the use by other persons in certain geographical areas of names and marks which are the same as or similar to our marks 
it is our policy to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our marks 
employees as of december   we employed  persons  of whom approximately  were restaurant team members  were restaurant management and supervisory personnel  were corporate personnel and were qc center and support services personnel 
most restaurant team members work part time and are paid on an hourly basis 
none of our team members is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our team member relations to be excellent 
item a 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act  including information within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the act 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including but not limited to  the following the ability of the papa john s system to continue to open new restaurants is affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among other things  litigation  selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  increases in or sustained high levels of food  paper  utilities  fuel  employee compensation and benefits  insurance and similar costs  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  and the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that system wide  papa john s will be able to meet planned growth targets  open restaurants in markets now targeted for expansion  or continue to operate in existing markets profitably 
the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to price  service  location and food quality  and there are many well established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources than the papa john s system 
some of these competitors have been in existence for a substantially longer period than papa john s and may be better established in the markets where restaurants operated by us or our franchisees are  or may be  located 
experience has shown that a change in the pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies  including new product and concept developments  of one or more of our major competitors can have an adverse impact on sales and earnings of papa john s and our system wide restaurant operations 
an increase in the cost of cheese or other commodities could adversely affect the profitability of our system wide restaurant operations 
cheese costs  historically representing to of our food cost  and other commodities are subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
additionally  sustained increases in fuel and utility costs could adversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and qc center businesses 
changes in consumer taste for example  changes in dietary preferences that could cause consumers to avoid pizza in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthful  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants could adversely affect our restaurant business 
health or disease related disruptions or consumer concerns about the commodity supply or the company s food products could negatively impact the availability and or cost of commodities and adversely impact restaurant operations and our financial results 
system wide restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime 
a significant number of hourly personnel employed by our franchisees and us are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
accordingly  further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates will increase labor costs for our system wide operations 
additionally  labor shortages in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
any or all of the factors listed in through potentially adversely impacting restaurant sales or costs could be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchisees in under penetrated or emerging markets 
a decline in or failure to improve financial performance for this group of franchisees could lead to unit closings at greater than anticipated levels and therefore impact contributions to marketing funds  our royalty stream  pjfs and support services efficiencies and other system wide results 
domestically  we are dependent on sole suppliers for our cheese  flour  and thin and pan crust dough products 
alternative sources for these ingredients may not be available on a timely basis to supply these key ingredients or be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements 
domestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and related products from our qc centers 
accordingly  both our corporate and franchised restaurants could be harmed by any prolonged disruption in the supply of products from our qc centers 
domestic franchisees are only required to purchase seasoned sauce and dough from our qc centers and changes in purchasing practices by domestic franchisees could adversely affect the financial results of our qc centers 
beginning in october of  a third party commercial insurance company began providing fully insured coverage to franchisees participating in our franchise insurance program  thus eliminating our risk of loss for franchise insurance coverage written after september the captive s relatively immature claims history limits the predictive value of estimating the costs of incurred and future claims  thus our operating income is subject to potential significant adjustments for changes in estimated insurance reserves for policies written from the captive s inception in october through september our domestic and international operations could be negatively impacted by significant changes in international economic  political and health conditions 
in addition  our international operations are subject to additional factors  including compliance with foreign laws  currency regulations and fluctuations  differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  availability and cost of land and construction  ability to source high quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  and differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our operations will achieve or maintain profitability or meet planned growth rates

at december   there were  papa john s restaurants in operation  consisting of company owned and  franchised  and franchised perfect pizza restaurants in the united kingdom 
our revenues are principally derived from retail sales of pizza and other food and beverage products to the general public by company owned restaurants  franchise royalties  sales of franchise and development rights  sales to franchisees of food and paper products  printing and promotional items  risk management services  and information systems and related services used in their operations 
new unit openings in were as compared to in and in and unit closings in were as compared to in and in the improvement in net unit growth during reflects improved operating margins for domestic unit restaurants and our continued international expansion 
we expect net unit growth of approximately to units during we have continued to produce strong average sales from our domestic company owned restaurants even with a very competitive market environment 
our expansion strategy is to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and enabling us to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
average annual company owned sales for our most recent quarter s comparable base restaurants were  for  compared to  for and  for average sales volumes in new markets are generally lower than in those markets in which we have established a significant market position 
the comparable annual sales for company owned restaurants increased in  increased in and decreased in we continually strive to obtain high quality sites with good access and visibility  and to enhance the appearance and quality of our restaurants 
we believe that these factors improve our image and brand awareness 
the average cash investment for the restaurants in our most recent comparable sales base is  the average cash investment for the seven domestic company owned restaurants opened during  exclusive of land  increased to approximately  from  for the six units opened in we expect the average cash investment for the anticipated company owned restaurants opening in to be approximately  approximately of our revenues for  compared to of our revenues for both and  were derived from the sale to franchisees of food and paper products  printing and promotional items  risk management services and information systems equipment and software and related services by us  our commissary subsidiary  pj food service  inc pjfs  our support services subsidiary  papa john s support services  inc  our insurance subsidiaries  rsc insurance services  ltd

our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in december of each year 
all fiscal years presented consist of weeks 
results of operations and critical accounting policies and estimates the results of operations are based on the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to select accounting policies for critical accounting areas as well as estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in assumptions and or conditions in our critical accounting policies could materially impact the operating results 
we have identified the following accounting policies and related judgments as critical to understanding the results of our operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts and notes receivable based on overall receivable aging levels and a specific evaluation of accounts and notes for franchisees with known financial difficulties 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if the identified franchisees continue to experience deteriorating financial results 
long lived and intangible assets the recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated if impairment indicators exist 
indicators of impairment include historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets on an operating unit basis eg  an individual restaurant based on undiscounted expected future cash flows before interest for the expected remaining useful life of the operating unit 
recorded values for long lived assets that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows are written down to current fair value  which is generally determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows for assets held for use or net realizable value for assets held for sale 
the recoverability of intangible assets ie  goodwill is evaluated annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist  on a reporting unit basis by comparing the fair value derived from discounted expected cash flows of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million associated with pjuk during the fourth quarter of  reflecting our updated estimated fair value of pjuk 
we have developed strategic plans for pjuk to improve future operating results 
these plans include selling the perfect pizza operations  consisting of the franchised units and related distribution operations  initiatives to increase brand awareness and increase net papa john s brand franchise unit openings over the next several years 
if such initiatives  including the sale of the perfect pizza operations  are not successful  additional impairment charges may occur 
insurance reserves our insurance programs for workers compensation  general liability  owned and non owned automobiles and health insurance coverage provided to our employees are self insured up to certain individual and aggregate reinsurance levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate retained liability for claims incurred using certain third party actuarial projections and our claims loss experience 
the estimated insurance claims losses could be significantly affected should the frequency or ultimate cost of claims significantly differ from historical trends used to estimate the insurance reserves recorded by the company 
from october through september  our franchisee insurance program  which provides insurance to our franchisees  was self insured 
beginning in october  a third party commercial insurance company began providing fully insured coverage to franchisees participating in the franchise insurance program 
accordingly  this new agreement eliminates our risk of loss for franchise insurance coverage written after september our operating income will still be subject to potential adjustments for changes in estimated insurance reserves for policies written from the inception of the captive insurance company in october to september such adjustments  if any  will be determined in part based upon periodic actuarial valuations 
deferred income tax assets and tax reserves as of december   we had a net deferred income tax asset balance of million  of which approximately million relates to bibp s net operating loss carryforward 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the deferred income tax assets related to bibp s net operating losses  since we believe it is more likely than not that bibp s future earnings will be sufficient to ensure the realization of the net deferred income tax assets for federal and state purposes 
certain tax authorities periodically audit the company 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our filed position 
we evaluate these issues on a quarterly basis to adjust for events  such as court rulings or audit settlements that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
consolidation of bibp commodities inc bibp as a variable interest entity bibp is a franchisee owned corporation that conducts a cheese purchasing program on behalf of domestic company owned and franchised restaurants 
as required by the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin  we began consolidating the financial results of bibp in the fourth quarter of we recognized pre tax income of approximately million during and pre tax losses of approximately million during from the consolidation of bibp 
we expect the consolidation of bibp to continue to have a significant impact on papa john s operating income in future periods due to the volatility of cheese prices 
papa john s will recognize the operating losses generated by bibp if the shareholders equity of bibp is in a net deficit position 
further  papa john s will recognize subsequent operating income generated by bibp up to the amount of bibp losses previously recognized by papa john s 
accounting changes interpretation no

fin as previously discussed  fin addresses the potential consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
the provisions of fin significantly alter the method for evaluating whether certain vies  as defined  should be consolidated in a company s financial statements 
as noted above  we began consolidating bibp at december  a cumulative effect adjustment was not required with the adoption of fin as bibp had a surplus in stockholders equity at december  papa john s is also the primary beneficiary  as defined by fin  of certain franchise entities that qualify as vies  even though we have no ownership interest in them 
as of december   we are the primary beneficiary of three franchise entities representing restaurants with annual revenues approximating million 
the consolidation of franchise entities deemed vies had no significant impact on our operating results during or we do not expect our future operating earnings to be significantly impacted by consolidating such entities

compared to variable interest entities as required by fin  our operating results include bibp s operating results 
the consolidation of bibp had a significant impact on our operating results in both and and is expected to have a significant ongoing impact on our future operating results and income statement presentation as described below 
consolidation accounting requires the net impact from the consolidation of bibp to be reflected primarily in three separate components of our statement of income 
the first component is the portion of bibp operating income or loss attributable to the amount of cheese purchased by company owned restaurants during the period 
this portion of bibp operating income loss is reflected as a reduction increase in the domestic company owned restaurant expenses cost of sales line item 
this approach effectively reports cost of sales for company owned restaurants as if the purchasing arrangement with bibp did not exist and such restaurants were purchasing cheese at the spot market prices ie  the impact of bibp is eliminated in consolidation 
the second component of the net impact from the consolidation of bibp is reflected in the caption loss income from the franchise cheese purchasing program  net of minority interest 
this line item represents bibp s income or loss from purchasing cheese at the spot market price and selling to franchised restaurants at a fixed quarterly price  net of any income or loss attributable to the minority interest bibp shareholders 
the amount of income or loss attributable to the bibp shareholders depends on its cumulative shareholders equity balance and the change in such balance during the reporting period 
the third component is reflected as investment income or interest expense depending upon whether bibp is in a net investment or net borrowing position during the reporting period 
in addition  papa john s has extended loans to certain franchisees 
under the fin rules  papa john s is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain franchisees even though we have no ownership interest in them 
beginning in the second quarter of  fin required papa john s to recognize the operating income losses generated by four franchise entities operating a total of restaurants with annual sales approximating million 
effective at the beginning of the second quarter of  one of these four franchise entities with restaurants and annual revenues approximating million  sold its restaurants to a third party 
the loan from papa john s was partially repaid and the remainder was written off in connection with this sale 
accordingly  beginning in the second quarter of  we were no longer required to consolidate the operating results of these restaurants 
the portion of the loan written off in connection with the second quarter sale was fully reserved as of the end of the first quarter 
the sale of these restaurants and related loan write off did not have any significant impact on papa john s consolidated statement of income 
the consolidation of the applicable franchise entities had no significant net impact on papa john s operating results

the united kingdom subsidiary has reported deteriorating operating results for the past three years primarily due to lower sales by perfect pizza restaurants and a decrease in net franchise units due to restaurant closings 
recently  the company developed a plan to sell its perfect pizza operations  consisting of the franchised units and related distribution operations 
the company believes the sale of the perfect pizza operations will be completed within the next months 
we have classified the perfect pizza operations  including directly associated g a expenses  as discontinued operations and the associated assets as held for sale

a million increase in domestic commissary sales reflecting the impact of higher commodity prices  principally cheese 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in the company s franchise insurance premium revenue and a million reduction in variable interest entities restaurant sales due to the sale of one of the previously consolidated franchise entities to a third party as of the beginning of the second quarter of our income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle totaled million in  as compared to million in excluding the impact of the consolidation of bibp pre tax gain of million or per share in and a pre tax loss of million or per share in  income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million  compared to million in this increase of million excluding the consolidation of bibp was principally due to the following analyzed on an operating segment basis see note of notes to consolidated financial statements domestic company owned restaurant segment 
domestic company owned restaurants operating income increased million over the prior year primarily due to the fixed cost leverage associated with an increase of in comparable sales during and improved margin from an increase in restaurant pricing  partially offset by increased commodity costs principally cheese 
we implemented a delivery charge for the majority of company owned restaurants in june  which allowed additional pricing flexibility that led to increased comparable transactions during the last half of additionally  the company owned operating results include a gain of million from the sale of restaurants from three transactions 
domestic franchising segment 
domestic franchising operating income increased million primarily as a result of higher royalties due to an increase of in comparable sales for domestic franchisees and lower administrative costs associated with franchise operations 
domestic commissary segment 
domestic commissaries operating income increased million primarily due to an improved operating margin and lower administrative costs  partially offset by increased distribution costs of million as a result of higher fuel costs

international segment 
the international segment  which excludes the perfect pizza operations expected to be sold within the next months  reported an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in the decrease in operating results is principally due to the previously mentioned million impairment charge associated with the united kingdom subsidiary 
all others segment 
the operating income for the all others reporting segment increased approximately million primarily due to increased sales from our print and promotions operations and an incremental million charge incurred by the franchise insurance program during the second quarter of related to claims loss reserves 
unallocated corporate segment 
the favorable year over year impact on operating income of the above items was partially offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses of million  primarily due to the following in millions increase decrease business unit and corporate management bonuses equity compensation and executive performance unit incentive plan professional fees employee benefits costs contribution to the marketing fund reduced allocation to operating units and other lease accounting adjustments recorded in total increase the increase in business unit and corporate management bonuses is the result of meeting pre established performance goals in as compared to minimal bonuses earned in the increased equity compensation charge is primarily related to the performance unit component of the executive incentive compensation program 
the ultimate cost associated with the performance units is based on the company s ending stock price and total shareholder return relative to a peer group over a three year performance period ending in december  with the awards paid in cash at the end of the performance period 
there were no such performance units outstanding in the increased professional fees are primarily related to consulting expenses associated with certain marketing and franchisee effectiveness projects 
the increase in employee benefits costs consists primarily of payroll taxes associated with an increased level of stock option exercises and an increase in the employer portion of fica taxes paid on employee tips and increased health insurance costs 
the company made a discretionary contribution to the papa john s marketing fund to fund an additional national television advertising flight in the fourth quarter of related to the launch of papa s perfect pan pizza

cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations decreased to million in compared to million in approximately million of the decrease is attributable to the consolidation of bibp and the remaining decrease is primarily due to unfavorable working capital changes  including increased levels of prepaid insurance due to the timing of payments and general premium increases  increased accounts receivable due to an extension of the timing of collections of certain items such as systems hardware and dvd s from franchisees  and increased inventory levels due to a change in payment terms with a significant supplier and generally higher commodity costs primarily cheese

the sale of the restaurants  which resulted in a one time gain of million  did not have a significant impact on our fourth quarter recurring operating results 
in addition  at the end of the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of five company owned restaurants  with annual revenues approximating million  in florida 
total proceeds from the transaction were million  which will be received in cash in fiscal  as assignments from landlords are received 
we recorded a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter from the sale of the five restaurants 
in the fourth quarter of  star papa  our owned joint venture operating papa john s restaurants in texas  completed the acquisition of six independently owned franchised papa john s restaurants located in the austin  texas area 
we also completed two agreements to purchase papa john s franchise restaurants located in the philadelphia  pennsylvania area during the fourth quarter 
the total consideration for these restaurants was million in cash and the forgiveness of accounts receivable approximating  during the first quarter of  we purchased an additional three restaurants in philadelphia for  we plan to consolidate additional franchise units in the philadelphia market as the opportunity arises and expect to build approximately company owned units over the next four to five years in order to more quickly achieve greater market penetration and awareness 
this buy and build approach may be used in additional under penetrated domestic markets over time to enhance overall net unit growth and market development 
we require capital primarily for the development  acquisition  renovation and maintenance of restaurants  the development  renovation and maintenance of commissary and print and promotions facilities and equipment and the enhancement of corporate systems and facilities 
additionally  we began a common stock repurchase program in december during  common stock repurchases of million  net repayments of million on our line of credit and million in net payments on vie associated debt and capital expenditures of million were funded primarily by cash flow from operations  proceeds from stock option exercises  proceeds from the previously mentioned restaurant divestitures and available cash and cash equivalents 
total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million  compared to million in the planned increase will support growth initiatives including the domestic company owned new unit growth  an expansion of printing capacity for the support services business unit  accelerated development of papa john s branded units in the united kingdom and technical support assets for numerous areas of the business  including the online ordering function 
in addition to the above mentioned planned capital expenditures  we may consider international investments to accelerate growth of papa john s branded units in certain markets 
our board of directors has authorized up to an aggregate of million for the share repurchase program through december  at december   as adjusted for a two for one stock split with a record date of december   a total of million shares have been repurchased for million at an average price of per share since the repurchase program started in approximately million shares in  million shares in   shares in and million shares prior to 
subsequent to year end through february   we acquired an additional  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of february   approximately million remains available for repurchase of common stock under this authorization 
we expect to fund the planned capital expenditures and any additional share repurchases of our common stock for the next twelve months from operating cash flow and the million remaining availability under our line of credit  reduced for certain outstanding letters of credit 
our debt  which is primarily due to the share repurchase program  was million  including million associated with bibp  at december   compared to million  including million associated with bibp and other consolidated vies  at december  contractual obligations and payments as of december  due by year are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total contractual obligations long term debt revolving line of credit total debt operating leases total contractual obligations excludes a fair value adjustment of  included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet related to our interest rate swaps that hedge against the effect of rising interest rates on forecasted future borrowings 
as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under real estate leases as a condition to the sale of certain company owned restaurants  we remain contingently liable for payment under the lease agreements 
these leases have varying terms  the latest of which expires in as of december  and december   the potential amount of undiscounted payments we could be required to make in the event of non payment by the primary lessee were million and million  respectively 
our franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases 
accordingly  the liability recorded for our exposure under such leases at december  and december  was not significant 
we have certain other commercial commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
such commitments include the following by year in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period less than year years years after years total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to contractual and other commitments 
the contractual obligations above exclude the debt  operating leases and other commercial commitments associated with vies 
the third party creditors and landlords of the vies do not have any recourse to papa john s 
impact of inflation we do not believe inflation has materially affected earnings during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs  particularly commodities  labor  benefits  insurance  utilities and fuel  could have a significant impact on us 
forward looking statements certain information contained in this annual report  particularly information regarding future financial performance and plans and objectives of management  is forward looking 
certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to the uncertainties associated with litigation  changes in pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies by competitors may adversely affect sales  new product and concept developments by food industry competitors  the ability of the company and its franchisees to meet planned growth targets and operate new and existing restaurants profitably  increases in or sustained high levels of food  paper  utilities  fuel  employee compensation and benefits  insurance and similar costs  the ability to obtain ingredients from alternative suppliers if needed  health or disease related disruptions or consumer concerns about commodities supplies  economic  political and health conditions in the countries in which the company or its franchisees operate  the selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations  negotiation of suitable lease or financing terms  constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants  higher than anticipated construction costs  the hiring  training and retention of management and other personnel  changes in consumer taste  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants  franchisee relations  federal and state laws governing such matters as wages  working conditions  citizenship requirements and overtime  and labor shortages in various markets resulting in higher required wage rates 
the above factors might be especially harmful to the financial viability of franchises in under penetrated or emerging markets  leading to greater unit closings than anticipated 
increases in projected claims losses for the company s self insured coverage or within the captive franchise insurance program could have a significant impact on our operating results 
our international operations are subject to additional factors  including currency regulations and fluctuations  differing business and social cultures and consumer preferences  diverse government regulations and structures  ability to source high quality ingredients and other commodities in a cost effective manner  and differing interpretation of the obligations established in franchise agreements with international franchisees 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our debt at december  was principally comprised of a million outstanding principal balance on the million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the revolving line of credit is variable and is based on libor plus a to basis point spread  tiered based upon debt and cash flow levels 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provided for a fixed rate of  as compared to libor  on million of floating rate debt from march to march  reducing to a notional value of million from march to march  and reducing to a notional value of million in march with an expiration date of march during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement that provides for a fixed rate of  as compared to libor  on the following amount of floating rate debt march  to january  million january  to january  million january  to january  million the effective interest rate on the line of credit  including the impact of the november interest rate swap agreement  was as of december  an increase in the present interest rate of basis points on the line of credit debt balance outstanding as of december   as mitigated by the interest rate swap based on present interest rates  would have no impact on interest expense since the debt balance is less than the million notional amount 
the annual impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on the debt associated with bibp would be substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations do not have a significant impact on our operating results 
cheese costs  historically representing to of our total food cost  are subject to seasonal fluctuations  weather  availability  demand and other factors that are beyond our control 
as previously discussed in results of operations and critical accounting policies and estimates  we have a purchasing arrangement with a third party entity  bibp  formed at the direction of our franchise advisory council for the sole purpose of reducing cheese price volatility to domestic system wide restaurants 
under this arrangement  domestic company owned and franchised restaurants are able to purchase cheese at a fixed price per pound throughout a given quarter  based in part on historical average cheese prices 
gains and losses incurred by bibp are used as a factor in determining adjustments to the selling price to restaurants over time 
accordingly  for any given quarter  the price paid by the domestic company owned and franchised restaurants may be less than or greater than the prevailing average market price 
as a result of the adoption of fin  papa john s began consolidating the operating results of bibp in consolidation accounting requires the portion of bibp operating income loss related to domestic company owned restaurants to be reflected as a reduction increase in the domestic company owned restaurant expenses cost of sales line item  thus reflecting the actual market price of cheese had the purchasing arrangement not existed 
the consolidation of bibp had a significant impact on our operating results in and and is expected to have a significant impact on future operating results depending on the prevailing spot block market price of cheese as compared to the price charged to domestic restaurants 
over time  we expect bibp to achieve break even financial results 
the following table presents the actual average block price for cheese and the bibp block price by quarter in  and actual block price bibp block price quarter quarter quarter quarter full year the following table presents the block price for cheese and the bibp block price by quarter as projected through based on the february  chicago mercantile exchange cme milk futures market prices block price projected bibp quarter quarter quarter quarter full year amounts are estimates based on futures prices 
the following table presents the and impact by quarter on our pre tax income due to consolidating bibp 
additionally  based on the cme milk futures market prices as of february   and the actual first and second quarter and projected third and fourth quarter cheese costs to restaurants as determined by the bibp pricing formula  the consolidation of bibp is projected to increase decrease our pre tax income as follows in in thousands projected actual actual quarter quarter quarter quarter full year the projections above are based upon current futures market prices 
historically  actual results have been subject to large fluctuations and have differed significantly from previous projections using the futures market prices 
over the long term  we expect to purchase cheese at a price approximating the actual average market price and therefore we do not generally make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices
