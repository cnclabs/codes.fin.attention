table of contents during with the comparable period in sources of revenue patient service revenue patient service revenue is generated by our inpatient facilities as a result of services provided to patients on an inpatient and outpatient basis within the inpatient behavioral health care facility setting 
patient service revenue is reported on an accrual basis in the period in which services are rendered  at established rates  regardless of whether collection in full is expected 
patient service revenue includes amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by medicare and medicaid under provisions of cost or prospective reimbursement formulas in effect 
amounts received are generally less than the established billing rates of the inpatient facilities and the differences are reported as deductions from patient service revenue at the time the service is rendered 
for the year ended december   patient service revenue comprised approximately of our total revenue 
management contract revenue management contract revenue is earned by our inpatient management contract division

table of contents terminated in and three were terminated in liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  was million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  at december  at december   our current liabilities included million of our notes  which were repaid on january  the increase in working capital is primarily due to working capital acquired with ardent behavioral and an increase in cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to the cash generated from the inpatient facilities we acquired in and the full year operations of the inpatient facilities acquired during cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions and million paid for the purchases of fixed assets 
cash used in the acquisition of ardent behavioral was approximately million  which came from borrowings on our revolving credit facility and senior secured term facility and our issuance of notes 
cash used for routine and expansion capital expenditures was approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  we define expansion capital expenditures as those which increase our capacity or otherwise enhance revenue 
routine or maintenance capital expenditures were of our net revenue for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of million paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures of approximately million 
during we acquired ten inpatient behavioral health care facilities  including four inpatient facilities from heartland 
during  our capital expenditures included typical routine capital expenditures of approximately million  as well as expansion capital expenditures 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  during  we raised million from our offering of notes and borrowed million under our senior secured term facility 
also during  we repaid approximately million of our notes and million of our senior secured term facility and as a result paid approximately million in refinancing costs 
we raised approximately million from issuances of our common stock during as a result of an offering of our common stock and stock option exercises 
during  we paid approximately million in loan and issuance costs related to borrowings of long term debt and issuances of common stock 
during  we received cash from an offering of our common stock and stock option exercises of approximately million 
also during  we paid approximately million to refinance our long term debt and million in loan and issuance costs 
on september   we received net proceeds of approximately million on the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
this sale of common stock drew upon a universal shelf registration statement on form s registering million of our common stock  common stock warrants  preferred stock and debt securities 
we have approximately million available under this universal shelf registration statement and may from time to time offer these securities  in one or more series  in amounts  at prices and on terms satisfactory to us 
we repaid million on our senior secured term loan facility with proceeds from this sale of our common stock 
these repayments are permanent and we cannot re borrow amounts previously repaid on the senior secured term loan facility 
we recorded a loss on refinancing long term debt of approximately million to write off capitalized finance costs associated with the debt that was repaid 
the remainder of the proceeds from this sale of our common stock was used to repay all indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the swap agreement effectively converts million of fixed rate long term debt to a libor indexed variable rate instrument plus an agreed upon interest rate spread of 
on april   we entered into another interest rate swap agreement 
this swap agreement effectively converts million of fixed rate debt to a libor indexed variable rate instrument plus an agreed upon interest rate spread of 
during july  we exited approximately million of our then existing million interest rate swap agreements without incurring a gain or loss on the transaction 
we are actively seeking acquisitions that fit our corporate growth strategy and may acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities 
management continually assesses our capital needs and  should the need arise  we will seek additional financing  including debt or equity  to fund potential acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
in negotiating such financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms satisfactory to us 
failure to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms could have a negative effect on our plans to acquire additional inpatient psychiatric facilities

we had zero and million  respectively  of variable rate debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility as of december  in addition  interest rate swap agreements effectively convert million of fixed rate debt into variable rate debt at december  at our december  borrowing level  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
impact of inflation and economic trends although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations  the health care industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
some of our freestanding owned  leased and managed inpatient behavioral health care facilities we operate are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in our swb expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to cover future cost increases  management believes that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
our ability to pass on increased costs associated with providing health care to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
the behavioral health care industry is typically not directly impacted by periods of recession  erosions of consumer confidence or other general economic trends as most health care services are not considered a component of discretionary spending 
however  our inpatient facilities may be indirectly negatively impacted to the extent such economic conditions result in decreased reimbursements by federal or state governments or managed care payers 
we are not aware of any economic trends that would prevent us from being able to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants and to meet all required obligations and commitments in the near future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses included in the financial statements 
estimates are based on historical experience and other information currently available  the results of which form the basis of such estimates 
while we believe our estimation processes are reasonable  actual results could differ from our estimates 
the following represent the estimates considered most critical to our operating performance and involve the most subjective and complex assumptions and assessments 
allowance for doubtful accounts our ability to collect outstanding patient receivables from third party payors and receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is critical to our operating performance and cash flows 

table of contents the primary collection risk with regard to patient receivables lies with uninsured patient accounts or patient accounts for which primary insurance has paid  but the portion owed by the patient remains outstanding 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based upon the age of the accounts since the patient discharge date 
we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the primary collection risk with regard to receivables due under our inpatient management contracts is attributable to contractual disputes 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for these receivables based primarily upon the specific identification of potential collection issues 
as with our patient receivables  we continually monitor our accounts receivable balances and utilize cash collection data to support our estimates of the provision for doubtful accounts 
allowances for contractual discounts the medicare and medicaid regulations are complex and various managed care contracts may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions requiring complex calculations and assumptions subject to interpretation 
we estimate the allowance for contractual discounts on a payor specific basis given our interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms 
the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
additionally  updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimation process by our management 
professional and general liability we are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide 
at december   all of our operations have professional and general liability insurance in umbrella form for claims in excess of a million self insured retention with an insured excess limit of million 
the inpatient facilities purchased from ardent were added to our insurance program on july  the self insured reserves for professional and general liability risks are calculated based on historical claims  demographic factors  industry trends  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent third party actuary 
this self insurance reserve is discounted to its present value using a discount rate 
this estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations 
we have utilized our captive insurance company to manage the self insured retention 
while claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals  the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates 
income taxes as part of our process for preparing our consolidated financial statements  our management is required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax benefit or expense of future deductible and taxable temporary differences 
the future deductible and taxable temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities which are components of our balance sheet 
management then assesses our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on reversals of deferred tax liabilities and  if necessary  estimates of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established when we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management must also assess the impact of our acquisitions on the realization of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance to determine if all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be offset by reversing taxable differences or future taxable income of the acquired entity 
to the extent the valuation allowance can be reversed due to the estimated future taxable income of an acquired entity  then our valuation allowance is reduced accordingly as an adjustment to purchase price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
with respect to our interest bearing liabilities  approximately million of our long term debt outstanding at december  was subject to a weighted average fixed interest rate of  not including our interest rate swaps 
our variable rate debt is comprised of our senior secured term loan facility  which had million outstanding at december  and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus to depending on a certain covenant ratio  and our million revolving credit facility  which had no balance outstanding at december  and on which interest is generally payable at libor plus to depending on a certain covenant ratio 
at december   we had million in interest rate swaps that effectively changed million of our fixed rate notes to a variable rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would decrease our net income and cash flows by approximately million on an annual basis based upon the borrowing level at december  in the event we draw on our revolving credit facility and interest rates change significantly  we expect management would take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change
