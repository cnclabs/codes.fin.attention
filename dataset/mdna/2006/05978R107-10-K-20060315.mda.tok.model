item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion and analysis reviews our results of operations and assesses our financial condition 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about us that is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
reference should be made to those financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report on form k for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
historical results of operations and any trends which may appear are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods 
we have updated our historical financial statements for discontinued operations related to sweet water state bank 
on april   we issued a press release announcing that we entered into a stock purchase agreement with respect to the sale of sweet water state bank 
on june   sweet water state bank met the requirements under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  for being classified as discontinued operations 
on august   we completed the sale of the stock of sweet water state bank 
on august   we filed our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   and that quarterly report classified the assets  liabilities and operations of sweet water state bank as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas this reclassification has no effect on the company s reported net income for any reporting period and has no material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents executive summary we are a multi bank holding company that was originally formed in as a delaware corporation under the name mobile national corporation 
in  we changed our name to south alabama bancorporation  inc and  in  reincorporated in alabama 
in may  we changed our name to banctrust financial group  inc as a bank holding company  our results of operations are almost entirely dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary banks 
the following table sets forth our subsidiary banks and selected data related to each bank bank number of locations market area counties total assets at december  in thousands mobile bank baldwin  escambia  marengo  mobile  monroe in alabama  florida bank bay  okaloosa  walton in florida  eufaula bank autauga  barbour  montgomery in alabama  through the banks  banctrust company  our wholly owned trust company subsidiary  and banctrust financial services  inc  a wholly owned securities and insurance subsidiary of the mobile bank  we offer a broad range of traditional banking services to our customers  including retail banking  trust  insurance and securities services and products 
like most community banks  we derive the majority of our revenue from the interest we earn on our loans and investments  and our greatest expense is the interest we pay on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our net interest income  which is the difference between the revenues we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expenses we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
another key measure of our success is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  which is called our net interest spread 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses  in the following discussions 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers  including service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage fees  trust fees and fees for investment services 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this non interest income  as well as of our non interest expense 
we measure and monitor the following factors as key indicators of our financial performance net income earnings per share loan and deposit growth credit quality

we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included in this report on form k 
effect of economic trends during most of and during  the united states experienced an economic decline 
during this period  the economy was affected by lower returns of the stock markets 
economic data led the federal reserve to begin an aggressive program of reducing interest rates that moved the federal funds rate down times during for a total reduction of basis points 
in and  the federal funds rate was reduced another basis points  bringing the federal funds rate in mid to its lowest level in years 
despite sharply lower short term rates  stimulus to the economy during was muted and consumer demand and business investment activity remained weak 
during and most of  the financial markets operated under historically low interest rates 
as a result of these unusual conditions  congress passed an economic stimulus plan in during  many economists believed the economy was beginning to show signs of strengthening  and the federal reserve increased the federal funds interest rate by basis points during the second  third and fourth quarters of and by an additional basis points during many economists believe that the federal reserve will stop increasing rates at some point during no assurance can be given that this will actually occur 
the specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio  especially the real estate portfolio  include  but are not limited to  a general downturn in the economy which could affect unemployment rates in our market areas  general real estate market deterioration  interest rate fluctuations  deteriorated collateral  title defects  inaccurate appraisals and financial deterioration of borrowers 
construction and development lending can also present other specific risks to the lender such as whether developers can find builders to buy lots for home construction  whether the builders can obtain financing for the construction  whether the builders can sell the home to a buyer and whether the buyer can obtain permanent financing 
for several years  real estate values in our metropolitan montgomery and coastal alabama and florida markets have increased  and employment trends in our market areas have been favorable 
that improvement continued through mid  however  a slowdown in loan demand was experienced in the last half of one possible reason for the slowdown is the psychological effect the recent hurricanes have had along the gulf coast  especially after hurricane katrina 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of december   beginning on page of this report on form k 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
table of contents amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a description of these policies is set forth below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
banctrust s determination of its allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with sfas nos 
and the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the amount of the provision charged to expense are based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current and expected economic conditions and such other factors that  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks and probable loss 
management uses the loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades 
for higher risk graded loans in the portfolio  the banks determine estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including historical loss experience  management s judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on higher risk graded loans  the financial capacity of the borrower  secondary sources of repayment including collateral and regulatory guidelines 
this determination also includes consideration of the balance of impaired loans which are generally considered to be non performing loans 
specific allowances for impaired loans are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans to the present value of these loans estimated cash flows at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral or the loan s observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition to evaluating probable losses on individual loans  management also determines probable losses for all other loans in the portfolio 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio is determined based on historical and current loss experience  portfolio mix by loan type and by collateral type  current economic conditions  the level and trend of loan quality ratios and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating inherent loan losses 
the methodology and assumptions used to determine the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the model assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
financial condition average assets and liabilities average assets in were billion  compared to billion in excluding the assets associated with discontinued operations  average assets increased million from to  an increase of percent 
average loans  net  in were million or percent higher than average loans  net  of million in loan growth was slow during and in the markets we served  however  there was a significant increase in loan demand beginning in  and the demand continued to accelerate in and into the first half of in the third quarter of we experienced a slowdown in loan demand along our gulf coast markets  possibly a reaction to the extreme hurricane season of average deposits of billion in were percent higher than average deposits of million in short term and long term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank 
table of contents fhlb borrowings  a loan from an unrelated commercial bank  overnight repurchase agreements  a note payable to our subsidiary statutory trust issued in connection with a trust preferred securities offering and deposits in the treasury tax and loan account 
we used the million loan from the unrelated commercial bank  which is included in long term debt  to partially fund the acquisition of commercesouth  inc our reliance on these funding sources has historically been low  however  we have recently increased our use of these types of borrowings to fund loan growth that has outpaced deposit growth

after the hurricane season  and especially after hurricane katrina  loan demand in our markets directly on the gulf of mexico began to slow 
while our offices are well to the east of the areas most directly affected by katrina  the slowdown in loan demand along the gulf coast beach markets could be the result  at least in part  of the psychological effects of the storms 
our average loan to deposit ratio was percent in compared to percent in and percent in our loan to deposit ratio at year end rose to percent compared to percent at year end and percent at year end 
table of contents our lending strategy concentrates on originating loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of our outstanding loans at december   million  or percent  mature within one year or otherwise reprice within one year 
maintaining high levels of short term and variable rate loans in our portfolio is a key component of our interest rate risk management strategy and has been a key contributor to our improving net interest revenue and net interest margin during the recent rising interest rate environment  as discussed more fully under results of operations 
we offer  through third party arrangements  certain mortgage loan products that we sell to these third parties shortly after origination and that are therefore not retained in our loan portfolio 
these products expand our mortgage loan product offerings and have generated significant fee income during the recent periods of lower mortgage rates 
these fees have come from first and second home purchases as well as substantial home refinancing volume 
as interest rates rise  we expect that mortgage loan refinancing volume will decrease somewhat  however  first and second home purchase volume is expected to remain strong in our alabama and florida gulf coast markets in the near term

table of contents securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
securities are classified as held to maturity if management has the positive intent  and we have the ability  to hold the securities until they mature 
securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities are classified as available for sale if they are to be held for indefinite periods of time  such as securities management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of our securities were in the available for sale category 
at december   we held no trading securities or securities classified as held to maturity 
the maturities and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   are presented in table at amortized cost using the average stated contractual maturities 
the average stated contractual maturities may differ from the average expected life because of amortized principal payments or because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations 
tax equivalent adjustments  using a percent tax rate  have been made when calculating yields on tax exempt obligations 
mortgage backed securities are shown only in the total as these securities have monthly principal payments

in average deposits grew million  or percent  compared to the commercesouth transaction accounted for million  or all but percent  of the increase in average deposits in  with the remaining increase resulting from growth in the gulf coast markets of alabama 
average deposits increased at a rapid pace in  growing from million in to billion in  an increase of percent 
our deposit mix  on average  has not significantly changed over the past few years 
we define core deposits as total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more 
core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  represented percent and percent at year end and respectively 
while our primary deposit taking emphasis focuses on attracting and retaining core deposits from customers who will also use our products and services  management has recognized that in order to fund loan growth  it is necessary from time to time to pursue non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
access to non core funding sources is particularly important in periods of very rapid loan growth  such as we experienced during and we will consider using non core funding sources during periods when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth

we sold federal funds of million on average during while average short term borrowings were million 
during and  as table demonstrates  we relied much more than we have historically on short term borrowings as a funding source to meet rapid loan growth 
we expect that we will continue to rely on short term borrowings as a loan funding source during times when loan growth is stronger than deposit growth

table of contents fhlb advances and long term debt we use fhlb advances as an alternative to other funding sources with similar maturities 
we favor fhlb advances as a funding source because they are flexible  allowing us to quickly obtain funding with the mix of maturities and rates that best suits our overall asset liability management strategy 
our fhlb advances totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  we used our long term fhlb advances primarily to fund loan originations 
of our outstanding fhlb advances at december   million had fixed interest rates  one million advance had a variable interest rate that reprices monthly and one million advance had a variable interest rate that reprices quarterly 
note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k sets forth additional information relating to outstanding balances  scheduled maturities and rates of our fhlb advances 
in  we increased our long term borrowings by issuing a note payable to our wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary  banctrust capital trust i the trust  which the trust purchased with the proceeds of million of trust preferred securities it sold to investors 
the note payable matures in december we pay interest on the note to the trust  and the trust pays distributions on trust preferred securities quarterly 
the interest rate we and the trust pay is reset quarterly at three month libor plus basis points 
we used the proceeds from the note payable to finance a portion of the purchase price for commercesouth  inc we do not have the option to repay any amounts of the note payable until december other long term debt as of december  also includes a million loan from an unrelated bank to the company 
this loan was incurred in january of to finance a portion of the purchase price for commercesouth  inc the loan is secured by a portion of banctrust s stock in the mobile bank 
this loan matures in and requires monthly interest payments at a floating rate of interest  reset monthly  of libor plus percent 
the company has the option to repay any part of the principal of the loan at any time without penalty 
this loan requires quarterly principal payments beginning march  at which time the remaining principal must be amortized over the remaining life of the loan 
the required principal payments for this loan are million in and and million in asset liability management the purpose of asset liability management is to maximize return while minimizing risk 
maximizing return means achieving or exceeding our profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
our asset liability management involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management that meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
management has not used derivative financial instruments as part of the asset liability management process 
our primary market risk is our exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing the effects of changes in market rates of interest on operating results and asset and liability fair values 
a key component of our interest rate risk management strategy is to manage and match the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
we use modeling techniques to simulate the effects various changes in market rates of interest would have on our interest income and on the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
important elements that affect the risk profile of our statement of condition in interest rate risk modeling include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates of assets and liabilities 
using the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table  applying a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  we would expect a net increase in net interest income of million for the year following the rate increase 
using a 
table of contents scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point decrease  we would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million for the year following the rate decrease 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events or of the actual effects such rate increases or decreases would have on our financial condition and operating results 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
in addition to our ability to meet liquidity demands through current assets and liabilities  we have available  if needed  federal funds lines of credit and fhlb lines of credit 
our asset liability committee  which is made up of certain members of management and the board of directors  monitors our liquidity position and formulates and implements corrective measures in the event certain liquidity parameters are exceeded 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements tables and present information about our contractual obligations  which by their terms are not short term  and off balance sheet arrangements at december  table contractual obligations dollars in thousands one year or less over one to three years four to five years more than five years total fhlb advances and long term debt operating leases certificates of deposit total refer to note in the consolidated financial statements  federal home loan bank advances and long term debt  for additional information about these obligations  including certain redemption features 
table off balance sheet arrangements dollars in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total lines of credit unused standby letters of credit total interest rate sensitivity by monitoring our interest rate sensitivity  management attempts to maintain a desired balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the 
table of contents market 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  we can identify interest rate risk 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities typically change at different times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liabilities can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest rate sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
before making adjustments to earning assets  management must evaluate several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  in order to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed to maximize net interest revenue while minimizing interest rate risk 
management may  from time to time  accept calculated risks associated with interest sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity 
at december   our three month gap position interest earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities was percent  and our twelve month cumulative gap position was percent 
both positions were within the range established by management as acceptable 
our three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of earning assets that reprice upward during the three months would be accompanied by in interest bearing liabilities repricing upward during the same period 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue could be expected to increase during the three month period of rising rates  as interest income increases would exceed increases in interest expense 
likewise  our twelve month gap position indicates that each of interest earning assets that reprices upward during such period would be accompanied by upward repricing of in interest bearing liabilities resulting in an increase in net interest revenue 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories of liabilities are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most  including deposits  are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
management has some flexibility when adjusting rates on these products 
therefore  the repricing of assets and liabilities would not necessarily take place at the same time and in the same amounts 

table of contents the following table summarizes our interest sensitive assets and liabilities from continuing operations as of december  adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which their interest rates are scheduled to adjust 
fixed rate loans are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities

certain types of savings accounts are included in the non interest rate sensitive within years category 
in management s opinion  these liabilities do not reprice in the same proportions as interest rate sensitive assets  as they are not responsive to general interest rate changes in the economy 
capital resources tangible shareholders equity shareholders equity less goodwill  other intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive income was million at december   compared to million at december  at year end  our tier capital ratio increased to percent from percent at 
table of contents year end the increase resulted from growth in tangible common shareholders equity of percent compared to growth in risk adjusted assets of percent 
in december  we formed a wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary the trust 
the trust issued million of trust preferred securities guaranteed by banctrust on a junior subordinated basis 
we obtained the proceeds from the trust s sale of trust preferred securities by issuing junior subordinated debentures to the trust  and used the proceeds to partially finance the purchase price of commercesouth  inc under revised interpretation no 
fin r recently promulgated by financial accounting standards board fasb  the trust must be deconsolidated with us for accounting purposes 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  the federal reserve board recently adopted changes to its capital rules with respect to the regulatory capital treatment afforded to trust preferred securities 
the federal reserve board s new rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included as tier capital up to of core capital  net of goodwill and intangibles 
we believe that our trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and expect that we will continue to treat our million of trust preferred securities as tier capital 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities are added to our tangible common shareholders equity to calculate tier capital 
our leverage ratio  defined as tangible shareholders equity divided by quarterly average assets  was percent at year end compared to percent at december  the federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies and banks to maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
our capital ratios expressed as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  for tier and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  we exceeded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december    and the minimum guidelines are shown on table see management s discussion and analysis capital adequacy  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents results of operations net interest revenue net interest revenue  the difference between amounts earned on assets and the amounts paid on interest bearing liabilities  is the most significant component of earnings for a financial institution 
changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities  and changes in the asset liability mix are the major factors that influence net interest revenue 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on interest earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net yield on interest earning assets is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of our effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
our net yield in  on a tax equivalent basis  increased basis points to percent compared to percent in after a rapid decline that began in  interest rates stabilized in  as did our net yield on interest earning assets 
as market interest rates began to rise in mid  our net yield also began to increase 
added to the positive effect of rising rates of interest on our net interest margin was a large increase in our loan volume 
this trend continued through many economists believe that the federal reserve will stop increasing rates at some point during if this happens  and loan growth is slower in than in the past several years  our margins may compress somewhat 
if our loan originations increase and begin to outpace our deposit growth in  we may be required to more aggressively price deposits in order to avoid even greater dependence on brokered deposits and borrowings to fund loans 
increasing the interest rates we pay on deposits could also have a negative effect on our net interest margin

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the charge to earnings that is added to the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
loan review procedures are in place to ensure that potential problem loans are identified 
the procedures management follows include a continuous review of the portfolios by our loan review department 

table of contents management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements and possible concentrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix and other economic factors 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report prepared by loan review officers and delivered to management  which uses the report to determine whether any adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are appropriate 
management submits these quarterly reports to banctrust s board of directors

non performing loans of continuing operations were million at year end compared to million at year end accruing loans days or more past due increased by thousand from to  primarily as a result of one loan

loans on non accrual increased to million at december  from million at year end  primarily as a result of the loans of two borrowers being placed on non accrual 
management anticipates foreclosing on the collateral securing the loans of these borrowers and has reserved an amount in the allowance for loan losses to cover the anticipated losses on these loans

however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by management s ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation
