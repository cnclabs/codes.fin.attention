item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview our business is concentrated in areas of the soft floorcovering market where innovative styling  design  color  quality and service as well as limited distribution are welcomed and rewarded 
through our fabrica  masland residential  masland contract and dixie home brands  we have a significant presence in the high end of the soft floorcovering market 
our candlewick carpet yarn operation supplies plied and heat set filament yarns primarily to our carpet manufacturing businesses and processes yarn for independent carpet manufacturers 
the rapid growth of our business since the third quarter of created operating issues that began to impact our manufacturing and distribution facilities in  resulting in delayed product introductions  significantly higher costs  poorer service and increased quality issues 
we addressed these issues by making a number of changes in our manufacturing and distribution facilities and management to reduce complexities and accommodate our growth 
in the second and third quarter of  we added staff and moved a significant portion of the inventory in our saraland  alabama distribution center to a new distribution facility in north georgia to reduce congestion at saraland and simplify our east coast distribution operations 
we began adding tufting manufacturing to the north georgia facility later in the year to reduce complexity in our atmore  alabama manufacturing facility 
although these initiatives accelerated our capital spending and caused us to incur costs to set up these operations  they shoul d allow us to regain our historical quality and service levels  as well as reduce cost in the future 
the north georgia distribution center is now fully operational and the tufting operation is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of in order to better utilize our west coast facilities  we consolidated three facilities into two and began producing products for our east coast operations 
this consolidation will also eliminate the cost of a leased facility in in the third quarter  we began installation of modular carpet tile equipment to expand our commercial product offering 
we are developing the initial line of modular products and expect to begin shipping these products to customers in the second quarter of in november and early fiscal  we sold substantially all of our assets located in north georgia  including our factory built housing carpet  needlebond  carpet recycling businesses and a carpet spun yarn manufacturing facility to shaw industries group  inc financial results for the operations sold have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the sale of these businesses significantly reduced our debt  diversified our customer base  and improved our strategic position 
critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made in preparing the financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance requiring management to identify its most critical accounting policies 
such critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although estimates have not been materially different from actual experience our estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when legal title of the products we sell passes to our customer  which is at the time goods are shipped 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions that exist at the time revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluation of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers significantly deteriorates  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide varying warranties related to our products against manufacturing defects and specific performance standards 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of known claims 
because our evaluations are primarily based on historical experience  actual results could differ from the reserves used in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated fair market value 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
goodwill 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the underlying assets and businesses to which the goodwill applies based on estimates of future cash flows  which require judgments and assumptions about future economic factors that are difficult to predict and in some cases beyond our control 
changes in our judgments and assumptions about future economic factors could materially change our estimate of values and could materially impact the value of goodwill and our consolidated financial statements 
self insured accruals 
we estimate the costs to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates that will be applicable in future periods when the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that the change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
loss contingencies 
we recognize a loss contingency when we believe it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
judgment must be applied to determine if such an event has occurred and to quantify the financial impact of such an event 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles 
the following table sets forth certain elements of our continuing operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses impairments and other charges other operating income other operating expense operating income fiscal year ended december  weeks  compared with fiscal year ended december  weeks net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
net sales of carpet products increased and net sales of carpet yarn decreased 
compared with  net sales of residential carpet increased and net sales of commercial carpet increased 
over half of the total improvement in net sales was attributable to the dixie home collection of residential products  which were introduced in early  and continue to gain acceptance in retail market channels 
a significant portion of the growth in our carpet business resulted from increased selling prices enacted during in response to raw material and other costs increases 
the trends we are seeing in our business lead us to believe our net sales will grow to in the decrease in carpet yarn sales is principally a result of carpet yarn sourcing arrangements in the prior year associated with the sale of our north georgia operations that did not continue into cost of sales 
cost of sales was of net sales in compared with in the increase in cost as a percentage of net sales in reflects the effect of rapid growth  higher raw material  energy and other costs and weather related disruptions on our operations 
the rapid growth of our carpet business experienced in recent years increased the complexity of our operations  significantly overtaxed our manufacturing  distribution and operational capabilities  and had a negative impact on customer service  product quality and manufacturing efficiencies 
to improve service to our customers  we added associates  lengthened operating schedules  and increased production outsourcing all of which increased costs in to simplify our east coast manufacturing and distribution operations and consolidate our west coast operations we added staff and moved inventory to two new distribution centers and started a new tufting manufacturing operation 
while the cost to staff and build the infr astructure of these new facilities was incurred in  these actions should simplify our operations and reduce costs in the future 
lags in passing higher raw material and utility costs through to our customers also significantly impacted our costs in the year over year comparison was also affected by lifo inventory liquidations that reduced cost of sales by thousand  or one tenth of a percentage point in and million  or eight tenths of a percentage point in gross profit 
the percentage point decline in gross profit was attributable to the costs increases described above 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million in  but decreased to of net sales compared with of net sales in the percentage decrease is primarily attributable to the higher sales volume 
other operating income 
other operating income increased thousand in principally due to a higher gains from the sale of operating equipment 
other operating expense 
other operating expense decreased thousand in primarily as a result of costs related to a contract dispute in that did not repeat in operating income 
operating income was million  or of sales in  compared with million  or of sales in interest expense 
interest expense increased thousand in as a result of higher levels of debt and higher interest rates 
other income 
other income decreased thousand in principally as a result of earnings from an unconsolidated subsidiary and the favorable settlement of a vendor dispute  most of which did not repeat in income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was for compared with for the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to reductions in our tax contingency reserve  greater utilization of state income tax credits and the deduction for domestic manufacturing production activities that became effective in net income loss 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in results related to discontinued operations reflected income of thousand  or per diluted share in  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share in including discontinued operations  net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with million  or per diluted share in fiscal year ended december   compared with fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
significant increases in sales of residential and commercial carpet products drove the improved revenue 
compared with  net sales of residential carpet increased and net sales of commercial carpet increased 
approximately half of the total improvement in net sales was attributable to our dixie home collection of residential products  which were introduced in early we believe the improved revenue is attributable to a growing economy and the overall strength of the carpet industry  particularly in the higher end of the soft floorcovering market where our business is concentrated  and the success of the new products we have developed during the past several years 
in  we developed a number of growth initiatives for our businesses 
these initiatives included introduction of the dixie home collection of products and a substantial increase in the development and introduction of new products in our other businesses 
the new products have been well received by the markets we serve and allowed us to increase business through existing customers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was of sales in both and the percentage comparison remained consistent despite significant increases in raw materials  utilities and other costs and a higher portion of our sales coming from lower margin products in the effect of the higher cost was offset by million due to a lifo inventory liquidation  increased selling prices and lower manufacturing costs per unit of production due to higher unit volume 
gross profit 
the million improvement in gross profit is principally attributable to the higher sales volume 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million in  but decreased to of net sales compared with of net sales in the percentage decrease is primarily attributable to the effect of the higher sales volume 
impairments and other charges 
we did not incur impairment and other charges in fiscal our operating income was negatively impacted by million of impairments and other charges principally related to assets impaired as a result of the sale of our north georgia operations 
other operating income 
other operating income decreased thousand in principally due to a lower level of gains from the sale of operating equipment 
other operating expense 
other operating expense increased in as a result of costs recognized related to a contract dispute 
operating income 
operating income was million  or of sales in  compared with operating income of million  or of sales in interest expense 
the million decrease in interest expense in was primarily a result of lower levels of debt 
other income 
other income improved thousand in principally as a result of the favorable settlement of a vendor dispute and higher interest income 
debt extinguishment costs 
we did not incur debt extinguishment costs in costs to extinguish debt retired prior to its scheduled maturity from the proceeds of the sale of our north georgia operations were million in such costs included million of charges for cash prepayment penalties and fees and million of non cash charges to write off deferred financing costs associated with the debt retired 
income tax provision benefit 
our effective income tax rate was for compared with benefit for the change in the effective tax rates is principally due to the relationship of expenses that are non deductible for tax purposes to pre tax earnings in each of these reporting periods and a thousand reduction in our tax contingency reserve in net income loss 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share in  compared with a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share in income from continuing operations was reduced by million  or per diluted share in  due to impairments and other charges and debt extinguishment cost related to the sale of our north georgia operations 
results related to discontinued operations reflected a loss of million  or per diluted share in  compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share in including discontinued operations  net income was million  or per diluted share in  compared with a net loss of million  or per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources during the three year period ended december   cash generated from asset sales was million 
these funds were primarily used to finance million used in our operating activities  invest million in capital assets  invest million in business acquisitions  and retire million of debt 
net proceeds from the sale of assets were million in  million in and million in the assets sold consisted primarily of a spun yarn manufacturing facility in and our north georgia operations in capital expenditures were million in and depreciation and amortization was million 
capital expenditures in were primarily for a north georgia distribution and tufting facility  equipment to produce modular carpet tile products and investments in new manufacturing technology 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million for the year  and depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million 
the capital expenditures will be primarily for newer manufacturing technology 
in july  we amended our senior loan and security agreement 
the amended agreement extended the term of the credit facility to may   reduced interest rates applicable to the credit facility  eliminated financial covenants and provided us with million of credit  consisting of million of revolving credit and a million term loan 
the term loan is payable in monthly principal installments of thousand that began september  and is due in may interest rates available under the senior loan and security agreement may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow us to borrow at rates ranging from the lender s prime rate to the lender s prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this agreement was at december  commitment fees of per annum are payable on the average daily unused balance of the revolving credit facility 
the levels of our accounts receivable and inventory may limit borrowing availability under the revolving credit line 
the facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
our senior loan and security agreement generally permits dividends and repurchases of our common stock up to aggregate annual amounts of million and such distributions in excess of million as may be made under conditions specified in the agreement 
the agreement also contains covenants that could limit future acquisitions 
the unused borrowing capacity under the facility s revolving credit facility on december  was approximately million 
during the three year period ended december   we financed million of our equipment purchases with various financial institutions 
our equipment financing notes have terms ranging from five to seven years  are secured by the specific equipment financed  bear interest ranging from to and are due in monthly installments of principal and interest of through february and monthly installments of principal and interest ranging from to from march through august the notes do not have financial covenants 
in  we used capital leases to financed million of our equipment purchases 
our significant capitalized lease obligations have terms ranging from five to six years  are secured by the specific equipment leased  bear interest ranging from to and are due in monthly installments of principal and interest of through january  monthly installments of principal and interest of from february through july and a final installment of in august the capitalized leases do not have financial covenants 
the following table contains a summary of the company s future minimum payments under contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period thereafter total dollars in millions debt interest debt capital leases interest capital leases operating leases purchase commitments variable rates used are those in effect at december  in february we received a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service permitting us to terminate one of our defined benefit retirement plans 
we expect to terminate this plan  contribute approximately million to fully fund the plan and distribute its assets to participants in the second quarter of we believe our operating cash flows and credit availability under our senior loan and credit agreement and other sources of financing are adequate to finance our normal liquidity requirements  including any contributions that will be required to terminate the defined benefit retirement plan described above 
future income tax considerations 
we do not anticipate that cash outlays for income taxes will be materially different than our provision for income taxes during the next three fiscal years 
our operating loss carryforwards  net of any related valuation allowance  is less than million at december  unrecognized losses on pension plans 
at december   we have unrecognized losses related to our defined benefit pension plans in the amount of million  net of tax 
such amount is included in other accumulated other comprehensive loss in the equity section of our balance sheet 
amortization against earnings for the unrecognized losses is not material 
approximately  million of the unrecognized losses relates to a defined benefit plan that is expected to be terminated in the second quarter of the unrecognized losses will be recorded as an expense when the plan is terminated 
approximately million of this amount will be recognized as a loss in discontinued operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands the company s earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates 
it is the company s policy to minimize its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding the company with debt 
the company addresses this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of derivative financial instruments 
at december   the company had an interest rate swap agreement on its mortgage note payable with a notional amount equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage note  at december  which expires in march of under the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of of interest times the notional amount and receives in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the mortgage note payable at 
on october   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  through may  under the interest rate swap agreement  the company pays a fixed rate of interest of and receives in return a specified variable rate of interest 
the interest rate swap agreement is linked to the company s variable rate debt and is considered a highly effective hedge 
at december    or approximately  of the company s total debt was subject to floating interest rates 
a fluctuation in the variable interest rates applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after tax impact on the company s net income of approximately
