item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary this summary is intended to identify the most important matters on which management focuses when it evaluates the financial condition and performance of the company 
when evaluating financial condition and performance  management looks at certain key metrics and measures 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis including comparisons with peer group financial institutions and with its own performance objectives established in the internal planning process 
the primary activity of the company is commercial banking 
the company s operations are located entirely in the southern and eastern regions of the general san francisco bay area of california 
the largest city in this area is san jose and the company s market includes the headquarters of a number of technology based companies in the region known commonly as silicon valley 
the company s customers are primarily closely held businesses and professionals 
lending loan growth is a key metric used by management to measure market share 
for the five year period ending december   the company sustained a consistent growth trend in commercial loans 
loan volume declined in when compared to  as a result of a decrease in demand for commercial loans 
commercial real estate mortgages demand also declined in from when interest rates  including mortgage rates  increased 
the majority of the company s commercial real estate mortgages are located in its primary service area and properties financed are often owner occupied 
construction lending in increased in from deposits growth in deposits is another important metric management uses to measure market share 
the company s depositors are primarily located in its primary market area 
depending on loan demand and other funding requirements  the company will occasionally obtain deposits from wholesale sources including deposit brokers 
the company had million in brokered deposits at december  the company also seeks deposits from title insurance companies and real estate exchange facilitators 
the company has a policy to monitor all deposits that may be sensitive to interest rate changes to help assure that liquidity risk does not become excessive due to concentrations 
net interest income the management of interest income and interest expense is fundamental to the performance of the company 
net interest income  the difference between interest income and interest expense  is the largest component of the company s total revenue 
management closely monitors both total net interest income and the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net interest income for the company has been significantly impacted by market rates of interest 
although assets have grown from million at december  to  million at december   net interest income for the years ended december  and december  are virtually the same 
this reflects an overall decline in the company s net interest margin 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate 
as the federal open market committee fomc reduced short term interest rates from to  the prime rate dropped sharply from at december  to in june the fomc began to increase short term rates in july and the prime rate at december  was 
the improvement in net interest margin in is largely attributable to the fomc action in because of its focus on commercial lending to closely held businesses  the company will continue to have a high percentage of floating rate loans and other assets 
management believes that the company s assets will tend to reprice faster than liabilities when market rates of interest change 
this characteristic makes the company asset sensitive 
banks with asset sensitive in balance sheets tend to perform better in a rising rate environment  ie  generate higher net interest income and have higher net interest margins 
in a falling rate environment  an asset sensitive bank does not tend to perform as well 
the company  through its asset and liability policies and practices  seeks to maximize net interest income without exposing the company to an excessive level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed by monitoring the pricing  maturity and repricing options of all classes of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this is discussed in more detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and asset liability management 
management of credit risk because of its focus on business banking  loans to single borrowing entities are often larger than would be found in a more consumer oriented bank with many smaller  more homogenous loans 
the average size of its relationships makes the company more susceptible to larger losses 
as a result of this concentration of larger risks  the company has maintained an allowance for loan losses which is substantially higher than would be indicated by its actual historic loss experience 
a complete discussion of the management of credit risk appears in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
the significantly lower provision for loan losses in was primarily attributable to the lack of loan growth  as well as gross loan recoveries of million 
noninterest income while net interest income remains the largest single component of total revenues  noninterest income has become a growing component 
a significant percentage of the company s noninterest income is associated with its sba lending activity  either as gains on the sale of loans sold in the secondary market or servicing income related to loans sold in the secondary market on which the company retains servicing 
in this document  sba loans and lending activities  include the origination  sale  and servicing of loans guaranteed by the us department of agriculture 
noninterest income associated with sba activity has increased each year from through risks associated with the continuation of this level of noninterest income from sba lending include the possibility that the federal government will eliminate or change sba programs in a manner that becomes less attractive to the company or to sba borrowers 
further  change in the secondary market for sba loans could reduce gains on sale 
higher than expected prepayments of sba loans on which the company has retained servicing could reduce the carrying value of the associated servicing asset and interest only strip 
loan servicing is discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in mid  the company closed its residential mortgage department because of concerns about its long term profitability in changing market conditions 
as a result of the closure  mortgage brokerage fees dropped significantly in and no mortgage brokerage fees were recognized in the closure of the mortgage brokerage department also eliminated costs  including salary and commissions  related to that activity 
during and  the company recognized  and  respectively  in income related to the short term leasing of electronic test equipment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company significantly reduced the carrying value of the electronic test equipment through a charge to operating expenses 
the electronic test equipment was sold in noninterest expense management considers the control of operating expenses to be a critical element of the company s performance 
the company undertook several initiatives to reduce its noninterest expense and improve its efficiency 
these initiatives included a reduction in staff and the consolidation of its operations under the common heritage bank brand and restructuring each department 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized additional expenses of million  representing the present value of term insurance for participants in the company s supplemental executive retirement plan  substantially all of whom have split dollar life insurance agreements with the company 
typically  under the split dollar life insurance agreements  the insureds beneficiary receives of the excess of the death benefit over the cash surrender value of the policy 
this accounting adjustment was undertaken after the company s review of split dollar life insurance agreements and recognition that the company has contractually agreed with each participant to provide life insurance on an ongoing basis without interruption 
in order to replace this coverage  the company would have to obtain term insurance for the remainder of the insureds expected lives  if the company ever terminated its company owned life insurance 
this charge reflects the term insurance cost for all insureds 
future expense will depend on the number of participants in split dollar arrangements and mortality experience  assuming no new participant or mortalities 
management estimates that this expense will approximate  in the emerging issues task force eitf  whose mission is to assist the financial accounting standards board by providing accounting guidance on issues where there is diversity in practice and or differing views about the application of generally accepted accounting principles  has added split dollar life insurance arrangements to its agenda for the eitf is expected to arrive at a consensus and issue more accounting guidance on this matter during  which may require implementation of new accounting guidance for split dollar life insurance agreements 
key performance measures through its asset and liability management process  the company monitors a number of ratios to analyze the company s performance over time and also to compare the company against similarly sized and situated companies in the banking industry 
management considers the following ratios to be important benchmarks for the company s performance and financial conditions return on average assets net income as a percentage of average assets 
measures the earning power of the balance sheet 
return on average equity net income as a percentage of average shareholders equity 
measures the return on invested capital 
net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
measures the earning power of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
efficiency ratio net interest income plus noninterest income divided by non interest expense 
measures the cost of producing revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
there is no single ratio or metric that summarizes the performance of the company 
the ratios above each take an element of the company s performance and quantify it  so that it can be compared over time and benchmarked against other peer companies 
management uses these and other ratios and metrics in assessing and planning the company s performance 
capital management and share repurchases heritage commerce corp and heritage bank of commerce meet the regulatory definition of well capitalized at december  as part of its asset and liability process  the company continually assesses its capital position to take into consideration growth  expected earnings  risk profile and potential corporate activities that it may choose to pursue 
as a part of this process  the company determined in the second quarter of that its capital levels were higher than necessary 
to adjust capital to levels consistent with its view of current market conditions  the company commenced a stock repurchase plan in june the repurchase program was completed at the end of third quarter on february   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock through june  shares may be repurchased in open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted under applicable rules and regulations 
the repurchase program may be modified  suspended or terminated by the board of directors at any time without notice 
the extent to which the company repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a per share quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend will be paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  the payment marks the company s first cash dividend 
the company expects to pay a quarterly dividend each quarter through critical accounting policies general hcc s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our consolidated financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in certain instances  we use a discount factor and prepayment assumptions to determine the present value of assets and liabilities 
a change in the discount factor or prepayment speeds could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities which would result in either a beneficial or adverse impact to our financial results 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
the company applies accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations to account for its stock option plan awards 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the impaired loan balance and value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent or present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market 
the company s allowance for loan losses primarily consists of a formula allowance for pools of loans and a specific allowance for individual impaired loans 
loan loss estimates can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and  as a result  losses could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the specific allowance uses impairment measurement to arrive at an estimate of loss  primarily collateral shortfalls on individual impaired loans 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could differ from the estimates 
for further information regarding our allowance for credit losses  see allowance for loan losses on page loan sales and servicing the company s allowance for loan losses primarily consists of a formula allowance for pools of loans and a specific allowance for individual impaired loans 
the amounts of gains recorded on sales of loans and the initial recording of servicing assets and interest only strips is based on the estimated fair values of the respective components 
in recording the initial value of the servicing assets and the fair value of the interest only i o strips receivable  the company uses estimates which are made based on management s expectations of future prepayment and discount rates 
in evaluating the servicing assets  management used discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require estimates regarding the amount and times of future cash flows  including assumptions about loan repayment rates  costs to service  as well as interest rate assumptions that contemplate the risks involved 
for the year ended december   management s estimate of constant prepayment rate cpr was and the weighted average discount rate assumption was 
these prepayment and discount rates were based on current market conditions and historical performance of the various pools 
if actual prepayments with respect to sold loans occur more quickly than projected  the carrying value of the servicing assets may have to be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
a corresponding decrease in the value of the i o strip receivable would also be expected 
stock based compensation under apb no 
 compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount required to be paid to the company by the optionee upon exercising the option 
because the company s stock option plan provides for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of the grant  no compensation cost is required to be recognized for the stock option plan on the date of grant 
for further information see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement requires that compensation costs related to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
measurement of the cost of employee service will be based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
that cost will recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
additionally  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period 
statement r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r will apply to awards granted or modified beginning in compensation cost will also be recorded for prior option grants that vest after the date of adoption 
the effect on results of operations will depend on the level of future option grants and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted at such future date  as well as the vesting periods provided  and so cannot currently be predicted 
existing options that will vest after adoption date are expected to result in additional compensation expense  after tax  of approximately  in and  in results of operations overview in  consolidated net income was  or per diluted share  compared to  or per diluted share in  and  or per diluted share  in the increase in from was primarily attributed to increases in the volume of average earning assets and increases in key market interest rates in average interest earning assets increased in from the increase in was primarily attributable to growth in average loans and federal funds sold

net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other liabilities 
net interest income depends on two factors the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities  and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared with the interest rate paid on those interest bearing assets and liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid

such loans include loans with maturities ranging from thirty days to one year and term loans  with maturities normally ranging from one to five years 
short term business loans are generally intended to finance current transactions and typically provide for periodic principal payments  with interest payable monthly 
term loans normally provide for floating interest rates  with monthly payments of both principal and interest 
the company is an active participant in the small business administration sba and us department of agriculture guaranteed lending programs  and has been approved by the sba as a lender under the preferred lender program 
the company regularly makes sba guaranteed loans and considers such loans to be investment loans  however  the guaranteed portion of these loans may be sold in the secondary market depending on market conditions 
once it is determined that they will be sold  these loans are classified as held for sale and carried at the lower of cost or market 
in the event of the sale of the guaranteed portion of an sba loan  the company retains the servicing rights for the sold portion 
as of december    and  million  million and million  respectively  in sba and us department of agriculture loans were serviced by the company for others 
as of december   real estate mortgage loans consist of adjustable and fixed rate loans secured by commercial property of  and loans secured by first mortgages on family residential properties of  home equity lines of credit are secured by junior deeds of trust on family residential properties totaling  properties securing the real estate mortgage loans are primarily located in the company s market area 
while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in market areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
real estate values in portions of santa clara county and neighboring san mateo county are among the highest in the country at present 
the company s borrowers could be adversely impacted by a downturn in these sectors of the economy  which could reduce the demand for loans and adversely impact the borrowers ability to repay their loans 
the company s real estate term loans consist primarily of loans made based on the borrower s cash flow and are secured by deeds of trust on commercial and residential property to provide a secondary source of repayment 
the company restricts real estate term loans to no more than of the property s appraised value or the purchase price of the property  depending on the type of property and its utilization 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans 
maturities on such loans are generally restricted to between five and ten years with amortization ranging from fifteen to twenty five years and a balloon payment due at maturity  however  sba and certain other real estate loans that are easily sold in the secondary market may be granted for longer maturities 
the company s real estate land and construction loans are primarily short term interim loans to finance the construction of commercial and single family residential properties 
the company utilizes underwriting guidelines to assess the likelihood of repayment from sources such as sale of the property or permanent mortgage financing prior to making the construction loan 
the company makes consumer loans for the purpose of financing automobiles  various types of consumer goods  and other personal purposes 
additionally  the company makes home equity lines of credit available to its clientele 
consumer loans generally provide for the monthly payment of principal and interest 
most of the company s consumer loans are secured by the personal property being purchased or  in the instances of home equity loans or lines  real property 
with certain exceptions  state chartered banks are permitted to make extensions of credit to any one borrowing entity up to of the bank s capital and reserves for unsecured loans and up to of the bank s capital and reserves for secured loans 
for hbc  these lending limits were million and million at december  the company does not have any concentrations by industry or group of industries in its loan portfolio  however  and of its net loans were secured by real property as of december  and while no specific industry concentration is considered significant  the company s lending operations are located in areas that are dependent on the technology and real estate industries and their supporting companies 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans as of december  the table shows the distribution of such loans between those loans with predetermined fixed interest rates and those with variable floating interest rates 
floating rates generally fluctuate with changes in the prime rate as reflected in the western edition of the wall street journal 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of floating interest rate loans 
over one due in year but one year less than over dollars in thousands or less five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total loans loans with variable interest rates loans with fixed interest rates total loans nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  loans past due days and still accruing  and other real estate owned 
management generally places loans on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless they are well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the accrual of interest is discontinued  and any related accrued and unpaid interest is reversed  and the amortization of the deferred loan fees and costs is discontinued 
any interest or principal payments received on the nonaccrual loans are applied to principal 
loans are charged off when management determines that collection has become unlikely 
other real estate owned oreo consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the related underlying defaulted loans 
the following table shows nonperforming assets at the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans loans days past due and still accruing total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans plus other real estate owned allowance for loan losses the company assigns to all of its loans a risk grade consistent with the system recommended by regulatory agencies 
grades range from pass to loss depending on credit quality  with pass representing loans that involve an acceptable degree of risk 
management conducts a critical evaluation of the loan portfolio monthly 
this evaluation includes periodic loan by loan review for certain loans to evaluate the level of impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools based on an assessment of the following factors past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  size and complexity of the loans  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  bank regulatory examination results  and current economic conditions in the company s marketplace  in particular the state of the technology industry and the real estate market 
this process attempts to assess the risk of loss inherent in the portfolio by segregating loans into four components for purposes of determining an appropriate level of the allowance watch  special mention  substandard and doubtful 
additionally  the company maintains a program for regularly scheduled reviews of certain new and renewed loans by an outside loan review consultant 
any loans identified during an external review process that expose the company to increased risk are appropriately downgraded and an increase in the allowance for loan losses is established for such loans 
further  the company is examined periodically by the frb and dfi at which time a further review of loan quality is conducted 
loans that demonstrate a weakness  for which there is a possibility of loss if the weakness is not corrected  are categorized as classified 
classified loans include all loans considered as substandard  doubtful  and loss and may result from problems specific to a borrower s business or from economic downturns that affect the borrower s ability to repay or that cause a decline in the value of the underlying collateral particularly real estate 
the principal balance of classified loans  which include all loans internally graded as substandard  doubtful  and loss  was   and  respectively  at december   and at december   all of the company s classified loans were graded as substandard 
it is the policy of management to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate for risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on information currently available to analyze loan loss delinquency and a history of actual charge offs  management believes that the loan loss allowance is adequate 
however  the loan portfolio can be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the company s market area were to weaken 
also  any weakness of a prolonged nature in the technology industry would have a negative impact on the local market 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of nonperforming loans and increased loan losses  which could adversely affect the company s future growth and profitability 
no assurance of the ultimate level of credit losses can be given with any certainty 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the following table summarizes the company s loan loss experience  as well as provisions and charges to the allowance for loan losses and certain pertinent ratios for the periods indicated dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year charge offs commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses reclassification of allowance for loan losses reclassification to other liabilities balance  end of year ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding allowance for loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans at end of period allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans the company reclassified  of the allowance allocated to million of commercial asset based loans that was reclassified to loans held for sale as of december  thus  the carrying value of these loans held for sale includes an allowance for loan losses of  the company reclassified estimated losses on unused commitments of  to other liabilities as of december  charge offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously though provisions for loan losses 
the increase in net charge offs in was primarily due to a  charge off from one commercial loan in  partially offset by recoveries 
the decrease in net charge offs in was primarily due to a  recovery of commercial loans which had been previously charged off 
the increase in net charge offs in  was primarily a result of a  write off taken in the third quarter of related to a single commercial loan 
historical net charge offs are not necessarily indicative of the amount of net charge offs that the company will realize in the future 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses all by loan type and the allocation as a percent of loans outstanding in each loan category at the dates indicated december  percent percent percent percent percent of loans of loans of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each in each in each category category category category category to total to total to total to total to total dollars in thousands allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans allowance loans commercial real estate mortgage real estate land and construction home equity consumer unallocated total loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of the loan balance is confirmed 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  the formula allowance and the unallocated allowance 
specific allowances are established for individual impaired loans 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying estimated loss factors to pools of similar loans 
loss factors are based on historical experience  adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
in adjusting the historical loss factors applied to the respective segments of the loan portfolio  management considered the following factors levels and trends in delinquencies  non accruals  charge offs and recoveries trend in volume and loan terms lending policy or procedural changes experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff national and local economic trends and conditions concentrations of credit there can be no assurance that the adverse impact of any of these conditions on the bank will not be in excess of the current level of estimated losses 
as of december   the company s unallocated allowance was  compared to  on december  in  the company updated its methodology in calculating the allowance  as a result the unallocated portion of the allowance increased 
if the same methodology used at year end was applied as of december   the unallocated allowance would be more comparable at these two dates 
in an effort to improve its analysis of risk factors associated with its loan portfolio  the company continues to monitor and to make appropriate changes to its internal loan policies 
these efforts better enable the company to assess risk factors prior to granting new loans and to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that it has adequately provided an allowance for estimated probable losses in the credit portfolio 
significant deterioration in northern california real property values or economic downturns could impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources and require additional provisions to the allowance or cause losses in excess of the allowance

market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values  or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including securities  loans  deposits and borrowings  as well as the company s role as a financial intermediary in customer related transactions 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the company s earnings and equity to loss and to reduce the volatility inherent in certain financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity the planning of asset and liability maturities is an integral part of the management of an institution s net interest margin 
to the extent maturities of assets and liabilities do not match in a changing interest rate environment  net interest margin may change over time 
even with perfectly matched repricing of assets and liabilities  risks remain in the form of prepayment of loans or securities or in the form of delays in the adjustment of rates of interest applying to either earning assets with floating rates or to interest bearing liabilities 
the company has generally been able to control its exposure to changing interest rates by maintaining primarily floating interest rate loans and a majority of its time certificates with relatively short maturities 
the table below sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   using the rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or when it is scheduled to mature within the specified time frame due in within three to due after three twelve one to due after not rate dollars in thousands months months five years five years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions securities total loans  including loans held for sale total interest earning assets cash and dues from banks other assets total assets interest bearing liabilities demand  interest bearing savings and money market time deposits securities sold under agreement to repurchase notes payable to subsidiary grantor trusts total interest bearing liabilities noninterest demand deposits accrual interest payable and other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholder s equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or at the same time 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities  which may have a significant effect on the net interest margin and are not reflected in the interest sensitivity analysis table 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap report may not provide a complete assessment of the exposure to changes in interest rates 
to supplement traditional gap analysis  the company performs simulation modeling to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rate environments 
the process allows the company to explore the complex relationships within the gap over time and various interest rate environments 
for additional information on the company s simulation model and the methodology used to estimate the potential effects of changing interest rates  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
liquidity risk represents the potential for loss as a result of limitations on the company s ability to adjust for future cash flows  to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers  and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the liquidity policy approved by the board requires annual review of the company s liquidity by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior executives  and the finance and investment committee of the board of directors 
the company s internal asset liability committee and the finance and investment committee of the board each meet monthly to monitor the company s investments  liquidity needs and to oversee its asset liability management 
the company evaluates the rates offered on its deposit products on a twice per month basis 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those which have a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of the company s operations  the company is not subject to foreign exchange or commodity price risk 
the company has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
as of december   the company does not use interest rate derivatives to hedge its interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent  and that the goal is to identify and accept the risks 
management uses two methodologies to manage interest rate risk a standard gap analysis  and an interest rate shock simulation model 
the detail from the company s gap analysis is shown under the caption interest rate sensitivity above  and is not discussed here 
the company applies a market value mv methodology to gauge its interest rate risk exposure as derived from its simulation model 
generally  mv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning assets and other investments and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing liabilities and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the mv which would result from a theoretical basis point basis point equals change in market interest rates 
both a basis point increase and a basis point decrease in market rates are considered 
at december   it was estimated that the company s mv would increase in the event of a basis point increase in market interest rates 
the company s mv at the same date would decrease in the event of a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
presented below  as of december  and  is an analysis of the company s interest rate risk as measured by changes in mv for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts of basis points in market interest rates change change market value as a of change change market value as a of in market in market present value of assets in market in market present value of assets dollars in thousands value value mv ratio change bp value value mv ratio change bp change in rates bp bp bp management believes that the mv methodology overcomes three shortcomings of the typical maturity gap methodology 
first  it does not use arbitrary repricing intervals and accounts for all expected future cash flows 
second  because the mv method projects cash flows of each financial instrument under different interest rate environments  it can incorporate the effect of embedded options on an institution s interest rate risk exposure 
third  it allows interest rates on different instruments to change by varying amounts in response to a change in market interest rates  resulting in more accurate estimates of cash flows 
however  as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent to the mv methodology 
the model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  rate changes are rarely instantaneous 
the use of the simplifying assumption that short term and long term rates change by the same degree may also misstate historic rate patterns  which rarely show parallel yield curve shifts 
further  the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react in the same way to changes in rates 
in reality  certain types of financial instruments may react in advance of changes in market rates  while the reaction of other types of financial instruments may lag behind the change in general market rates 
additionally  the mv methodology does not reflect the full impact of annual and lifetime restrictions on changes in rates for certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans 
when interest rates change  actual loan prepayments and actual early withdrawals from certificates may deviate significantly from the assumptions used in the model 
finally  this methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan clients ability to service their debt 
all of these factors are considered in monitoring the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity risk represents the potential for loss as a result of limitations on our ability to adjust our future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the liquidity policy approved by the board requires annual review of the company s liquidity by the asset liability committee  which is composed of senior executives  and the finance and investment committee of the board of directors
