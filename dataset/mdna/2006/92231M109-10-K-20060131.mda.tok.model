specialty catheter product line 
we received regulatory clearance for the langston dual lumen pigtail catheter in september and launched this product in the fourth quarter of the langston catheter is used to measure the precise measurement of aortic stenosis 
we believe these four new product lines together with sales of our existing duett product line  d stat flowable product line and other products  will result in continued substantial revenue growth in the range of to for we also believe our gross margin percent will be approximately to during results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets

acolysis is sold only in international markets 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our selling mix continues to change to our higher margin products such as our d stat dry  which has gross margins greater than 
we expect gross margins to be in the range of to in as our selling mix continues to change and our new v version of the pronto has higher manufacturing costs than the original pronto 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of our increased investment in research and development as well as our increase in head count to employees at december  versus at december  we expect our normal research and development expenses to be approximately to of sales per quarter in as we continue to pursue additional new products at an expected rate of approximately two new products per year and we continue to move our longer term development projects forward 
research and development expenses will decline as a percent of sales throughout as our sales increase 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of increased clinical study activity  increased fda fees and increased number of employees compared to during our clinical studies consisted of the pocket protector study for a new indication of our d stat flowable product and the d stat dry study to obtain clinical data to support growing sales of the d stat dry 
clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical and marketing studies 
we expect clinical and regulatory expenses to be approximately to of sales per quarter in as we continue to pursue additional new products at an expected rate of approximately two new products per year and we continue to move our longer term development projects forward 
clinical and regulatory expenses will decline as a percent of sales throughout as our sales increase

as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to be between and of sales per quarter in sales and marketing expenses are expected to decline as a percent of sales throughout as our sales increase 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of higher legal fees relating to the diomed litigation see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k along with higher business insurance and accounting fees in compared to we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately to of sales per quarter in thrombin qualification project expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  we expect the total remaining expenses associated with our qualification of the new source of thrombin to be approximately million in amortization of purchased technology was  for each of the years ended december  and the amortization resulted from our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and are amortizing the amount over four years 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher interest rates 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets

net sales of other products were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in other products was due to increased freight revenue  which is the result of increased shipments

income taxes we have not generated any fiscal year pre tax income to date and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception in december no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes has been recorded for net operating losses incurred in any period since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had a foreign tax loss carryforward of approximately million  which does not expire 
under the united states tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
we performed a section change in ownership study during the third quarter on our federal net operating loss carryforward  and we concluded that we will have no limitations on the net operating loss carryforward 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed all of our operations since inception through the issuance of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our products 
through december   we have sold capital stock generating aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand compared to  at december  during the year ended december   we used  in cash as a result of operating activities  we incurred capital expenditures in the amount of  and we generated  in financing activities through the sale of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and issuances under employee stock plans 
our capital expenditures included equipment related to our thrombin qualification process  leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment 
our operating cash usage was primarily the result of our planned build up of thrombin from our current supplier as well as our required purchase from our new supplier to qualify our new source of thrombin 
we purchase our requirements for thrombin a component in the duett and in all of the d stat products under a purchase agreement dated june  with a subsidiary of king pharmaceuticals  inc the agreement provides for a fixed price  with adjustments based on the supplier s manufacturing costs and the supplier s annual percentage increase in the wholesale price of thrombin 
the agreement expired on may  prior to the expiration of the agreement  we issued purchase orders for approximately million of thrombin to benefit from the pricing provisions of the agreement  which thrombin we expect to be delivered through the third quarter of we believe that these purchases will satisfy our thrombin requirements through at least the end of we have taken delivery of approximately million of the million of king thrombin through december  we have executed a supply agreement for a new source of thrombin  which we plan to fully qualify and bring through the regulatory process by the second quarter of at a cumulative cost of approximately million in development and qualification expenditures  of which approximately million of the expenses remain and are projected to be incurred in we have purchased  in capital expenditures out of our total planned capital expenditures of  we also have purchased million of thrombin from our new supplier as of the end of  which fulfills our thrombin purchase requirement 
with the thrombin already purchased and our planned additional king thrombin purchases  we expect our inventory to peak at approximately million at the end of the third quarter of  and then decrease throughout the remainder of and as the king thrombin is used in our products 
this investment  while substantial  is within our projected capital resources and we expect will allow us to introduce new thrombin based products as well as control our long term cost of thrombin 
the failure by us to complete our thrombin qualification project on time and on budget may affect our gross margins on our duett  d stat flowable and d stat dry products and could therefore seriously harm our business 
we currently have a million credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the million revolving line of credit has a month term  bears interest at the rate of prime plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets 
the million equipment line of credit has a month term  bears interest at the rate of prime plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets 
the credit facility includes two covenants minimum tangible net worth of  through august    through november   and  thereafter  and liquidity coverage of not less than to 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the million credit facility and the availability of the million revolving line of credit was million 
on january   we drew down million of the equipment line 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more then years facility operating leases    sigma contract commitment   king pharmaceutical thrombin purchases   total contractual cash obligations    we do not have any other significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience positive cash flow from our normal operating activities  excluding requirements associated with our new supply of thrombin 
we currently believe that our working capital of  at december   our recent million equipment advance and our anticipated cash from product sales will be sufficient to meet all of our operating and capital requirements  including our thrombin inventory purchases under our current thrombin supply contract and our costs associated with the new supply of thrombin 
however  our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  the cost and progress of our research and development efforts  and other factors 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional funds 
in the event that additional financing is needed  and depending on market conditions  we may seek to raise additional funds for working capital purposes through the sale of equity or debt securities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements 
we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the estimated value of excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value is established by us on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future demand  anticipated release of new products into the market  historical experience and product expiration 
our stated value of inventory could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved and  if approved  customers are subject to a restocking charge 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide a warranty for certain products against defects in material and workmanship for periods of up to months 
we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the amount we are charged by our original equipment manufacturer to cover the warranty period 
the original equipment manufacturer includes a year warranty with each product sold to us 
we record a liability for the uncovered warranty period offered to a customer  provided the warranty period offered exceeds the initial one year warranty period covered by the original equipment manufacturer 
at december   this warranty provision was  compared to  at december  if the assumptions used in calculating the provision were to materially change  resulting in more defects than anticipated  an additional provision may be required 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states and  to a lesser extent  germany  based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets of million 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirement for a valuation allowance 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r is effective for us starting with the quarter ending march  early adoption is encouraged and retroactive application of the provisions of sfas r to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date is permitted  but not required 
we estimate the expense associated with sfas r will be in the range of million to million in see the stock based compensation discussion in note of our financial statements for information related to the pro forma effects on our reported net income loss and net income loss per common share of applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents principally at one major bank and one investment firm in the united states 
we have a formal written investment policy that restricts the placement of investments to issuers evaluated as creditworthy 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral 
there have been no material losses on accounts receivables 
in the united states and germany  we sell our products directly to hospitals and clinics in the local currency 
in all other international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical clinics 
we sell our product in these countries through independent distributors denominated in united states dollars 
loss  termination or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature 
we did not have any indebtedness as of december  if we were to borrow from our revolving credit or equipment line  we would be exposed to changes in interest rates  see note advances under our revolving and equipment lines of credit bear interest at an annual rate indexed to prime 
we will thus be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to these lines of credit to the extent that interest rates rise when there are amounts outstanding under these lines of credit 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
