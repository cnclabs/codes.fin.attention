item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview jaco is a leading distributor of active and passive electronic components to industrial oems that are used in the manufacture and assembly of electronic products in such industries as telecommunications  medical devices  computers and office equipment  military aerospace  and automotive and consumer electronics 
products distributed by the company include semiconductors  flat panel displays  capacitors  resistors  electromechanical devices and power supplies 
the electronics industry experienced a severe downturn beginning in  which continued through most of the decline was attributable to increased manufacturing capacity combined with a significant decrease in demand for electronic components 
the second half of saw an improvement in the demand for electronic components throughout the entire industry 
while demand for our products has remained relatively stable in recent periods  the average selling prices of many of the components we distribute  particularly semiconductor and passive components  have decreased due to global competitive pressures  which has adversely affected our operating profits 
in response  the company has implemented cost reduction initiatives to reduce expenses as required to support current sales and profit levels 
due to the ongoing shift of manufacturing to the far east  the company has modified its business model to pursue the business available in the united states  increase its support of global contract manufacturers that require its value added services and logistics programs  and aggressively promote its flat panel display fpd product offerings  which have experienced significant growth in fiscal and which the company believes have potential for growth in the future 
net loss increased in fiscal to million  compared with a net loss of million during fiscal fiscal results were impacted by an income tax provision of million to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to zero as management has no longer able to conclude that  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized

critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectible amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors rendering inventories as unsellable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent franchise agreements and non compete covenants 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur 
valuation of deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we would record a valuation allowance when  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the amount of future tax benefit would not be realized 
while the company still believes that it is positioned for long term growth  the volatility in our industry and markets has made it increasingly difficult to predict sales and operating results on a short term basis  and when coupled with the cumulative losses reported over the last five fiscal years  the company was no longer able to conclude that  based upon the weight of available evidence  it was more likely than not that its previously recorded deferred tax asset of million would be realized  and therefore  in the fiscal year ended june   it recorded a provision for million income tax to reduce the carrying value of its deferred tax asset to zero 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the shipment of finished products to its customers when title is transferred 
revenue is recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been shipped to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue for rebates and estimated customer returns and other allowances 
we offer rebates to certain customers based on the volume of products purchased 
our products are sold on a stand alone basis and are not part of sales arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the product is shipped as we do not have any obligations beyond shipment to its customers 
when the shipping terms are fob shipping point  revenue is recorded as the goods leave our facility 
in certain instances and to certain customers  goods are shipped with shipping terms of fob destination point 
in these instances we determine when the goods are delivered to our customer s facility and calculate whether an adjustment to defer revenue recognition is required 
if such adjustment is material  an adjustment is recorded in the financial statements 
historically  such adjustments have not been material 
a portion of our business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  we are responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
as the principal with the customer  we recognize revenue when we are notified by the supplier that the product has been shipped 
we also maintain a consignment inventory program  which provides for certain components to be shipped on site to a consignee so that such components are available for the consignee s use when they are required 
the consignee maintains a right of return related to unused parts that are shipped under the consignment inventory program 
revenue is not recognized from products shipped on consignment until notification is received from our customer that they have accepted title of the inventory that was shipped initially on consignment 
the items shipped on consignment in which title has not been accepted are included in our inventories 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeitures 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option term assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the adoption of sfas no 
r has had no current impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flow 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
 which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
sfas no 
amends opinion to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal periods after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements in fiscal in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition and threshold measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be takes on a tax return 
the company will be required to adopt the interpretation in the first quarter of fiscal management is currently evaluating the requirements of fin no 
and has not yet determined the impact on the consolidated financial statements results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit 
loss from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal net sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
net sales for the three months ended june  were million compared to million for the three months ended june   an increase of million  or 
we support contract manufacturers  primarily in the far east  with inventory management services 
sales to these contract manufacturers decreased during fiscal by million  or  to million from million in fiscal primarily due to lower demand from these customers during the first half of fiscal demand from these customers strengthened in the second half of fiscal and  as a result  net sales to contract manufacturers in the second half of fiscal were higher than in the same period of fiscal sales to contract manufacturers represented of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal our logistical programs  consisting of inventory management services and warehousing capabilities  through which we generate sales to our contract manufacturer customers  are comprised almost entirely of semiconductors 
semiconductors represented of our net sales during fiscal compared to in fiscal passive components  which are primarily commodity product such as capacitors and resistors  represented of our net sales during fiscal compared to in fiscal reflecting the continuation of a long term trend  passive component unit pricing continued to decline in fiscal  partially due to additional supply capacity  primarily originating from the far east 
accordingly  we do not anticipate material increases in our passive component sales for the foreseeable future 
electromechanical products  such as power supplies  relays  and printer heads  represented of our net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal we believe that these products  which typically have high per unit selling prices  remain a viable offering for the us market 
primarily through our logistic programs with contract manufacturers in the far east  our export sales represented approximately of our net sales in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal we sell flat panel displays fpds as a component sale through our standard distribution channel and we sell fpd product as a value added offering through our in house integration center  primarily to target markets where we believe we can be competitive  including such sectors as electronic voting machines  electronic kiosk  military and multimedia equipment 
we provide design capabilities and a full solution capability enabling us to offer our customers an expanded range of services to integrate fpds into their applications sales in fiscal increased to million compared to million for fiscal the growth is primarily attributable to increased sales through our integration center  which was fully operational for all of fiscal as compared to only five moths of fiscal after opening in february 
fpd product represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we continue to aggressively market our fpd product  while looking to complement our core product lines with our value added services  and utilization of our quote group to quickly respond to customer inquiries 
we currently identify new business opportunities with our vendors to support the needs of global contract manufacturers 
in addition  we continue to seek to identify potential strategic alliances to expand our presence in the far east in response to the significant growth in manufacturing in the region that has occurred in recent years 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand for product 
during fiscal  we took a write down for obsolete inventory of approximately million based on our determination that  due to changes in market conditions in the united states  certain product primarily intended for specific customers were no longer saleable 
excluding this write down  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been 
the increase in our gross profit margin in fiscal is primarily due to the increase in sales of our higher margin fpd product  decrease in sales associated with our logistical programs with global contract manufacturers which usually operate at lower margins  and as a result of our focus on those core vendors whose products are higher margin and still have viable market in the united states 
however  we do not anticipate any material change in our gross profit margin for the foreseeable future unless we experience an increase in sales associated with our logistical programs 
in addition  demand and pricing for our products have been  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industry wide trends and events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  representing a reduction of million  or 
management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
we have been able to implement significant cost reductions by focusing our spending on core business areas while decreasing spending in non strategic areas 
this has allowed us to lower sg a while maintaining the necessary infrastructure to support our customers 
we plan to continue to look for areas of cost reduction 
however  the increase in our net sales during recent quarters has required us to increase certain costs to support our growth  although we carefully evaluate any potential increase in spending 
therefore  we do not anticipate any further reductions in sg a for the foreseeable future 
interest expense increased million  or in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest expense has increased primarily due to continuing increases in federal lending rates resulting in higher borrowing rates under out credit facility 
continued increases in borrowing rates would further increase our interest expense  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million consisting mainly of a million deferred tax write off 
while the company believes that it is positioned for long term growth  as indicated by our profitability for each of the last two quarter of fiscal  the volatility in our industry and markets has made it increasingly difficult to predict sales and operating results on a short term basis and  when coupled with the cumulative losses reported over the last four fiscal years and the first two quarters of fiscal  the company was no longer able to conclude that  based on the weight of available evidence  it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset of million would be realized 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our net income from continuing operations was  or per diluted share 
our net income for the fourth quarter and reduced net loss for fiscal is due to our increase in gross profit dollars and reduction in sg a expenses 
net loss in fiscal was almost entirely attributable to our write off of million in deferred tax assets during the fiscal year for the reasons described above and in note e of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal results from continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
we have seen demand for our products remain stable for the last two quarters of fiscal the average selling price of many of our components has decreased over compared to our previous fiscal year and where practical  customers continued to outsource their manufacturing requirements to the far east 
these factors were the primary reason for the decrease in our net sales 
as a result  we have adapted our marketing strategy in the united states to support the business that we see remaining in the united states  and have made changes to better serve our existing customer base 
recent initiatives include expanding our quote group to enable us to be more responsive to the mid level contract manufacturers and changing our marketing efforts to focus on those core lines  including fpds  where we believe we can increase our net sales 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we opened in our hauppauge  new york facility an in house fpd integration center that enables us to expand our value added capabilities to our customers 
we believe it is important for distributors of electronic components to focus on the value added services that our customers require 
our ability to grow sales will be partially dependent on our ability to increase fpd  sales and including the integration center  we have made extensive efforts to increase this business going forward 
fpd product represented of our net sales during fiscal as compared to in fiscal we continue to market semiconductors aggressively 
semiconductor sales represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal although our business focus is primarily on the us market  we maintain a sales presence in the far east targeted at the global contract manufacturing customers to which we primarily sell semiconductors through our logistics programs  which consist of inventory management and warehousing capabilities 
passive components  which are standard commodity items such as capacitors and resistors  represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal due to the increase in capacity worldwide  we saw pricing in passive components decrease by over 
electromechanical products  such as power supplies  relays and printer heads  represented of our net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal we believe this is a product line with higher selling prices that still has a viable market in the united states 
primarily through our logistics programs with global contract manufacturers  our export sales represented approximately of our net sales for fiscal as compared to in fiscal most of these sales derived from business that we were able to maintain as it transitioned from the united states to the far east 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand for product 
during the fourth quarter  we took a write down of approximately million for obsolete inventory based on our determination that  due to changes in market conditions in the united states  certain of our products primarily intended for distribution to specific customers were no longer saleable 
without this write down  our gross profit margin for fiscal would have been 
as discussed above the company conducts large amounts of business through its logistics programs in support of global contract manufacturers  which constitute lower end  value added services that tend to be at lower margins than the rest of our business 
in addition  demand and pricing for our products have been adversely affected by industry wide trends and other events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  representing a reduction of million  or 
management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
we continue to reduce our costs by targeting our marketing expenditures on our core business areas while paring back elsewhere 
this approach has allowed us to lower sg a while maintaining the necessary infrastructure to support our customers 
we have been able to reduce personnel and eliminate non essential fixed costs by among other measures  achieving rent reductions  and due to the decrease in gross profit dollars  our sale commissions have decreased 
as of june  certain cost saving measures were still being implemented 
interest expense increased million for fiscal to million  compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to higher borrowing levels to maintain adequate inventory  primarily to support a specific customer  and higher borrowing rates 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share full diluted for fiscal as discussed above our net loss from operations was impacted in part by our inventory write down of approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
our net loss from continuing operations compared to fiscal is attributable to the decrease in our net sales and reduction in gross profit margin due to changes in the mix of our products sold and inventory write down 
discontinued operations on september   the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of its contract manufacturing subsidiary  nexus custom electronics  inc nexus  to sagamore holdings  inc 
for consideration of up to  subject to closing adjustments  and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the divestiture of nexus allows the company to focus its resources on its core electronics distribution business 
under the terms of the purchase agreement relating to this transaction  the company received  of the purchase consideration in cash on the closing date 
such cash consideration was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit 
the balance of the fixed portion of the purchase consideration was satisfied through the delivery of a  subordinated note issued by the purchaser 
this note has a maturity date of september  and bears interest at the lower of the prime rate or 
the note is payable by the purchaser in quarterly cash installments ranging from  to  commencing september which initial payment was not made and continuing for each quarter thereafter until maturity 
prepayment of the principal of and accrued interest on the note is permitted 
additionally  the company is entitled to receive additional consideration in the form of a six year earn out based on of the annual net sales of nexus after the closing date  up to  in the aggregate 
on september   nexus nano electronics  inc nne  as successor to sagamore  and its subsidiary filed suit against jaco in the us district court for the southern district of new york alleging fraud and misrepresentations by the company in connection with the sale of nexus and seeking an unspecified amount of damages 
the company believes that the plaintiffs claims are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously as well as assert counterclaims for amounts owed to it in connection with such sale  if this matter is not settled 
subsequent to the filing of this suit  the parties entered into settlement discussions and have reached an agreement in principle to settle this matter for  among other things  a mutual release of all disputed claims relating to this transaction and the cancellation of the purchaser s million subordinated note held by the company in consideration for nne s issuance to the company of shares of its preferred stock 
the documentation relating to this proposed settlement has not yet been finalized or approved by the parties respective boards of directors and  therefore  the company cannot assure you that this settlement will be completed upon the terms described above or at all 
net earnings from these discontinued operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal year the decrease in our net earnings from discontinued operations compared to last year was primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales and gross profit from discontinued operations  which was partially offset by the gain on the sale of nexus 
combined net loss the combined net loss from both our continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal the increase in our combined net loss compared to last year is primarily attributable to the reduction in our net sales and gross profit margins  as described above 
liquidity and capital resources to provide liquidity and flexibility in funding its operations  the company borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing 
on december   the company entered into a third restated and amended loan and security agreement with gmac commercial finance llc and pnc bank  national association originally providing for a  which has subsequently be reduced to  revolving secured line of credit 
this credit facility has a maturity date of december  borrowings under the credit facility are based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company  as defined in the credit agreement  and are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at june   the outstanding balance on this revolving line of credit facility currently was million  with an additional million available 
at june   the company also had outstanding under the credit facility million of stand by letters of credit on behalf of certain vendors million as of september  
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at june  was approximately 
under the credit agreement  as amended  the company is required to comply with the following financial covenants maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined therein of to for the six months ending june   nine months ending september  and for each of the twelve months ending each quarterly period thereafter  maintain minimum net worth as defined therein  commencing august   of not less than  increasing as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter by of the net profit for such quarter  if any  reduced by the amount of specified special charges and write offs as defined therein  which includes the establishment of a valuation allowance of up to million  and a limitation on capital expenditures of  for the fiscal year ending june  and for each fiscal year thereafter 
the credit agreement also restricts the company s ability to pay dividends 
in addition  the agreement includes a subjective acceleration clause and requires the deposit of customer receipts to be directed to a blocked account and applied directly to the repayment of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
accordingly  this debt is classified as a current liability 
on september   the company s credit facility was amended to waive its non compliance with certain bank covenants  including maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and minimum net worth  for the quarter ended june  the company s credit facility was also amended to reduce the maximum available loan amount from  to  and modify the existing covenants and add additional covenants  including  among other things to i modify the availability formula  as defined therein ii reset existing covenants for fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum net worth and capital expenditures each as defined therein  and iii add a new covenant regarding maintenance of operating cash flow each as defined therein  which replaced its former bank covenant regarding minimum ebitda 
commencing with the week ended october   the company failed to be in compliance with its four week minimum sales covenant to which it is no longer subject 
on november   the company received a waiver from its lenders to cure its non compliance 
at december   the company was in violation of its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant contained in the credit agreement 
on february   the company s credit facility was further amended  among other things  to i retroactively reset the amounts under its existing fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as described above  ii increase the interest rates on outstanding borrowings by  iii modify the availability formula  iv provide for a temporary additional availability amount of up to  from february  through and including february   of up to  from february  through and including march   and thereafter  and v require the company s inventory to be appraised on a semi annual rather than annual basis by an appraiser designated by its lenders at the cost of the company 
on march   pnc bank  national association  one of the original lenders under the credit agreement  assigned all of its rights and interest in the credit agreement to the cit group business credit  inc on may   the company s credit agreement was further amended to increase the sublimit on the aggregate amount of letters of credit permitted to be outstanding thereunder from  to  effective as of april  as of june   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants contained in the credit agreement 
at june   the company had cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  as compared to cash of approximately  and working capital of approximately  at june  as described above  our credit agreement requires our cash generated from operations to be applied directly to the prepayment of indebtedness under our credit facility 
for fiscal  our net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal the decrease in our net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to the net decrease in current liabilities for fiscal  offset by our non cash write off of million of deferred income taxes  as compared to a substantial decrease in our accounts payable partially offset by a large advance payment from a specific customer in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the fiscal  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributable to million in net proceeds we received from our sale of substantially all of the assets of nexus in september net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the fiscal as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the fiscal the increase in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to an increase in net borrowings under our credit facility of approximately million and the repayment of indebtedness under our credit facility in fiscal with the proceeds from our sale of nexus 
for fiscal and fiscal  our inventory turnover was and times  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  were days  as compared to days at june  inventory turnover and average days outstanding are key operating measures that management relies on to monitor our business 
based on preliminary discussions with our lenders  we believe we will be able to renew our credit facility on terms similar to those currently in effect prior to its scheduled maturity on december   although we cannot assure you that this renewal will occur 
based upon our present plans  including no anticipated material capital expenditures  we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue  while continuing to control costs  and remaining in compliance with our bank covenants 
historically  we have  when necessary  been able to obtain amendments or waivers to our credit facilities to satisfy instances of non compliance with financial covenants 
while we cannot assure that any such future amendments or waivers  if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms under our existing credit facility or through other external sources 
in the event that in the future we are unable to obtain such an amendment or waiver of our non compliance with our financial covenants  the lenders under our credit facility could declare us to be in default under the facility  requiring all amounts outstanding under the facility to be immediately due and payable and or limit the company s ability to borrow additional amounts under the facility 
if we did not have sufficient available cash to pay all such amounts that become due and payable  we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing through other external sources  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  total years long term debt   capital lease    operating lease      total      our credit facility currently has a maturity date of december   as stated above  we believe we will be able to renew this facility or  in the alternatives refinance the indebtedness outstanding thereunder through borrowings under a new credit facility  and  therefore  we expect to continue to have significant long term debt obligations outstanding after december  inflation and seasonality inflation and seasonality have not had a significant impact on our operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at a variable rate dependent upon either the prime rate  federal funds rate or the libor rate rates 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in any of the rates during the current fiscal year will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the rate will increase or decrease our interest expense under the credit facility by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our other floating rate debt is not material
