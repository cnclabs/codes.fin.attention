the tax expense for is the result of a  increase in in a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as of december  the increase in the valuation allowance will not have an impact on the ability of the company to utilize the net operating losses that comprise the deferred tax asset 
exclusive of the increase in the valuation allowance  the tax provision for would have been a benefit of the increase in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to the write off of the sefl investment  the expensing of costs associated with the countryside transaction and foreign currency transaction expense associated with the countryside financing

liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and restricted cash and marketable securities totaled  including  which is recorded as a long term asset 
of this amount   was unrestricted compared with  of unrestricted cash at december  the financing arrangements between the countryside fund and the useb projects require these subsidiaries to maintain various restricted cash accounts  which  at december   amounted to  including the  classified as long term asset 
these funds are presented as long term because they are being reserved to retire the long term illinois subsidy liabilities as they become due 
 of the marketable securities classified as a long term asset is managed by a money manager under investment allocation parameters established by the company and useb 
the investment accounts managed by the money manager  as of december  included  invested in equity funds   invested in debt funds and  being held in cash or cash equivalents 
the cost basis of the investments  which have been invested with the money manager since july  is  during  net cash of  provided by operating activities was offset by  used in investing activities and  used by financing activities  resulting in an decrease in non restricted cash and cash equivalents of  during  cash flow provided by operating activities was  an increase of  from the  of cash used by operating activities in the increase is the primarily the result of a smaller net loss from operations in when compared to during  cash flows used in investing activities was  compared to the  provided by investing activities in the change was primarily due to the inclusion in of the sale of use canada and an increase in in acquisition of equipment and leasehold improvements resulting from useb s capital maintenance program 
during  cash flow used by financing activities was  a decrease from the  provided by financing activities in the decrease is primarily the result of the inclusion in of the refinancing of the useb debt with the countryside fund  the sale of the useb royalty interest to the countryside fund and an increase in useb s debt service payments due to the refinancing with the countryside fund 
in  net cash increased by  to  from the  reported as of december  the net increase was a  increase over the net increase of  this increase is primarily due to the net cash received through the countryside transaction which included the sale of usey s canadian assets and the refinancing of useb s debt   offset by an approximate  reduction in net operating income exclusive of the write off of the sefl investment 
the reduction in net operating income was primarily due to the a decrease in revenues due to the closing of useb s readville and reductions in net useb revenues due to rate reductions and the elimination of sefl management fees 
useb s financing arrangements with the countryside fund limit the ability of useb and its subsidiaries to distribute funds to the company or to make improvements or expand certain projects unless specified conditions are satisfied 
the company  through an indirect or greater owned subsidiary  is in the process of acquiring certain energy assets in the united kingdom 
the total expenditures to be incurred in connection with the acquisition of these assets is currently estimated to be approximately  furthermore  in connection with this transaction  it is currently estimated that i reserves of approximately  must be funded and ii additional capital expenditures required to modify or expand to these assets will require  during the next three years  approximately  it is anticipated that these expenditures will be funded through the company s available funds and external financing which may include project debt financing secured by the project assets 
no assurance can be given that external financing will be available on terms acceptable to the company  and if unavailable  the company may be unable to complete the acquisition or fully realize the potential of such assets 
except as noted with respect to the acquisition of these energy assets and the related expenditures  management believes that the company has sufficient cash flow from operations and working capital to satisfy its current obligations under outstanding indebtedness  to finance anticipated capital expenditures and to fund working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

critical accounting policies and the use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s audited consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements required management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information 
estimates are made based on historical factors  current circumstances and the experience and judgement of management 
assumptions and estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and the company may employ outside experts to assist in evaluations 
therefore  actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting estimates are more significantly affected by judgement and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements the valuation of goodwill  the determination of revenue from biogas projects participating in the illinois retail rate program and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company used estimates in the valuation of the goodwill asset 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
actual future operating results that deviate from the estimates would have an effect on the future valuation of the goodwill asset 
rates currently paid to projects participating in the illinois retail rate program utilize estimated rates which are reconciled annually  by the utility purchasing the electricity  on the anniversary date of the projects commercial operations date 
variations in actual rates to the estimated rates would have an effect on the company s financial results and cash flows 
the company is unable to predict changes in rates as they are dictated by the actions of the local utilities and muncipalities of the respective projects 
the company uses estimates in the determination of the likelihood of the ability to use net operating losses nol s 
see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
actual future operating results that deviate from the estimates would have an effect on the company s ability to use nol s  the valuation of the deferred tax asset and the company s future taxability on both an accrual and cash basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business including the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations  changes in the wholesale price of energy and changes in corporate tax rates 
fluctuations in interest rates and investment yields will affect earnings derived from the investment of the various reserve accounts which could have a material effect on the company s financial performance 
fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar as it relates to the payment of debt service on the the countryside fund loan could also have a material effect on the company s financial performance 
generally the company does not enter into any interest rate or derivative transaction as a hedge against these market risks as the underlying asset and investments are long term in nature 
however  the foreign currency hedge entered into by useb  as further discused in notes j and m to our consolidated financial statements  eliminates the impact  from a cash flow perspective  of fluctuations in exchange rates on our countryside debt service payments through march
