item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are engaged in the design  manufacture  distribution and sale of women s and children s apparel  and vinyl  leather and fabric handbags  sport bags  backpacks  cosmetic bags  and related products 
our apparel lines include women s loungewear  sleepwear  dresses and sportswear  and lingerie  as well as infants and children s clothing 
our products are mostly made to order  and we market and sell our products to a range of retailers  including general merchandise stores  retail chain stores  department stores  cosmetic companies  major mail order catalogs and other specialty retailers 
our business is subject to seasonal variations 
consistent with what we believe is the general pattern associated with sales to the retail industry  our results of operations are somewhat more meaningful on a seasonal basis  rather than on a quarterly basis 
in that regard  our net sales and net earnings generally have been higher during the period from june to november which includes our first fiscal quarter and a portion of our second and fourth fiscal quarters  during which time our customers generally increase inventory levels in anticipation of both back to school and holiday sales 
net sales and net earnings for the other months of our fiscal year typically have been lower due  in part  to the traditional slowdown by our customers immediately following the winter holiday season 
that trend has continued during fiscal and we expect this pattern to continue 
however  our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of other factors  including the timing of shipments to customers and general economic conditions 
accordingly  comparisons between seasons or quarters may not necessarily be meaningful  and the results for any one quarter or season are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results or of full year performance 
in fiscal  higher gross margins combined with a slight increase in sales improved net earnings and earnings per share 
the financial highlights of fiscal were o gross profit increased  to  compared with  in fiscal o net earnings rose about to  or per diluted share  compared with  or per diluted share in the prior fiscal year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in estimates have been insignificant for the years ended june   and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and we also maintain accounts receivable insurance on certain of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not incurred significant bad debt account expenses for the years ended june   and market development accruals 
we estimate reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis based on current experience  trends and our customers performance 
sales discount  returns  marketing programs and allowances were  and of sales for the years ended june   and  respectively 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
in making this assessment  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic considerations  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying value 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge which would impact earnings 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences in the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
significant judgement is required in determining the provisions for income taxes 
we establish the provisions based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax provisions are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the moody s aa corporate bond index 
the indices selected reflect the weighted average remaining period of benefit payments 
the discount rate increased to as of june  from as of june  a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately  liquidity and capital resources cash flows certain information about our financial position as of june   and is presented in the following table june  cash    working capital    long term debt    stockholders equity    cash flows provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended june   and were as follows june  operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase in cash    the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended june  of  was the result of funds provided by financing activities totaling  offset by funds used in operating activities of  and by funds used in investing activities totaling  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of  reflecting primarily higher fourth quarter sales in fiscal compared to the prior comparable period and an increase in inventory totaling  mostly attributable to higher anticipated first quarter net sales for fiscal versus the first quarter in

results of operations compared to net sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  or  compared to fiscal sales by category were as follows net sales for the apparel category in fiscal were  a decrease of  or  compared to fiscal the sales decrease for this category was primarily due to a  decrease in net sales from the women s sleepwear business  which resulted mostly from decreased orders from one customer based on prior season sell through of both private label and licensed product 
this decrease was offset  in part  by a  or  increase in sales of children s apparel reflecting a higher level of reorders from one of our customers due to favorable prior sales of similar items 
our catalog business continued lower demand for mail order apparel with a  decline in net sales in fiscal compared with the prior year 
net sales for the handbags category were  for the year ended june   an increase of  or about above the same period in the prior year  reflecting a  increase in the premium business as a result of increased orders by one of its significant customers  and a  increase in our handbag business attributable to an increase in sales of denim related products 
overall gross margins were in compared to in the prior fiscal year 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in improved to from in the prior fiscal year 
the percentage point improvement was primarily attributable to higher margins contributed by the children s apparel business due to a favorable product mix  as well as higher margins in the women s sleepwear business which was attributable to approximately million of lower margin business from one customer which was not reordered in fiscal gross margin for the handbags category increased to in compared to in the similar prior year 
the higher gross margin in the handbag business  for the most part  reflects both product mix and improved costing measures in both the premium incentive and the handbag business 
shipping  selling and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal to  of net sales 
the prior fiscal year totaled  of net sales 
a significant part of the net increase was attributable to higher compensation costs approximately  and increased product development costs  relating to further expansion of our premium and children s apparel businesses  as well as higher royalty expense  relating to additional licensed product sales 
these increases were not fully offset by lower shipping and warehousing costs  resulting from a combination of lower sales volume for one division having relatively higher shipping and handling costs and sales mix for another division requiring lower shipping supplies and temporary help  as well as lower selling commissions as a result of changes in sales mix a decrease of 
interest expense was  a decrease of  from the last fiscal year  despite higher interest rates in fiscal compared to fiscal the net decreased level of borrowing more than offset the higher weighted average interest rate in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal and is primarily the reason for the lower interest expense 
lower borrowing is attributable to the timing of sales this year with resulting improved cash flows 
net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to net earnings of  in the prior year 
this year s higher net earnings were primarily due to improved gross margins and lower interest expense  not completely offset by higher shipping  selling and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
compared to net sales for fiscal totaled  an increase of  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase reflected significantly higher handbag net sales  not fully offset by lower apparel net sales 
sales by category were as follows net sales for the apparel category in fiscal were  a decrease of  or from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the elimination of several private label programs from one of the women s sleepwear division s customers  and a reduction in net sales in our catalogue business due to the loss of one of that business significant customers who will be sourcing goods directly 
net sales for the handbags category in fiscal were  or higher than the prior fiscal year s total of  the sales increase is mostly attributable to increased sales for the premium business reflecting continued growth with its most significant customer  and somewhat higher net sales in our other handbag division 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in the decrease in gross margins is mostly a function of much lower handbag margins this fiscal year 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in decreased to compared to in this percentage point decrease was primarily attributable to much lower gross margins in the children s apparel business  due to required higher customer allowances in the current fiscal year versus fiscal  not fully offset by higher women s sleepwear business gross margins 
gross margin for the handbags category in decreased to compared to 
this decrease was mainly due to much lower competitive margins in our premium business 
the much lower gross margin in the premium business  for the most part  reflects marketplace competition resulting in the company reducing its gross profit margin in order to maintain sales 
in addition  we experienced lower handbag business margins due to reduced sales of licensed products which normally carry a higher margin  in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal shipping  selling and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal to  as a percentage of net sales  shipping  selling and administrative expenses declined to from in fiscal the principal factors attributable to the decrease are lower selling expenses a decrease of approximately  reflecting lower selling commissions attributable to sales mix  lower royalty expense relating to the reduced sale of licensed products approximately  and lower general and administrative expense in fiscal about  mostly due to the approximately  fiscal charge for the union pension withdrawal liability  offset somewhat by higher product development expense about  in fiscal for the children s apparel business associated with anticipated higher volume in fiscal interest expense was  an increase of  from the last fiscal year  primarily the result of higher interest rates in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
this year s lower net earnings were primarily due to lower gross margin dollars and higher interest costs  not fully offset by lower shipping  selling and administrative expenses  as discussed above  as well as a lower effective tax rate in the current fiscal year primarily attributable to the recovery of a valuation allowance associated with foreign tax credits  compared to fiscal recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas is an amendment of accounting research board opinion and sets standards for the treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to interest rate change market risk 
since our borrowing patterns are cyclical  we are not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
nevertheless  a sudden increase in interest rates which under our bank line of credit is at the prime rate or at libor plus basis points may  especially during peak borrowing  potentially have a significant negative impact on our results of operations 
we estimate that a basis point fluctuation in applicable market interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  based on fiscal our average commercial borrowing levels 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollar based currencies
