item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a diversified industrial company that designs  manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls  scientific and industrial imaging products and software  industrial technology products  instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellite based communication technologies and related services 
we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency rf applications  water  energy  research and medical  and other niche markets 
we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses 
our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms 
we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments 
on february   we purchased inovonics  a provider of mhz radio frequency products primarily for security  sub metering and remote temperature monitoring applications 
on june  we purchased civco  a provider of diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in conjunction with ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures primarily in urology  radiology and cardiology 
on november   we purchased medtec  which designs  develops and distributes enabling technologies essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment for cancer care 
medtec products include patient positioning devices  image guided therapy software  and related products and accessories 
during the year ended december   our results of operations benefited from the transcore acquisition made on december   the power generation business of r d tech purchased on june   and the partial year activities of inovonics  civco and medtec 
in conjunction with the acquisition of transcore  a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification rfid  satellite based communication  mobile asset tracking  security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services  we replaced our existing million credit agreement  completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  and entered into an amended and restated billion credit agreement 
an underwriters overallotment of  shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on december  during the year ended december   our results of operations benefited from the neptune technology group holdings  inc ntgh acquisition made on december  and the partial year activities of the power generation business of r d tech purchased on june  application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results  such as determining inventory cost  depreciating long lived assets  recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees 
we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management 
our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec 
although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable  others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available 
if an accounting estimate changes  its effects are accounted for prospectively 
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility  inventory utilization  future warranty obligations  revenue recognition percent of completion  income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses 
these issues  except for income taxes  which are not allocated to our business segments  affect each of our business segments 
these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience  current conditions and relatively short term forecasting 
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products  including in certain cases credits for returned products 
accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms  whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences  what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers 
the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was million  for a total of million  or of total gross accounts receivable 
this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables  the timing of write offs of accounts deemed uncollectible and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the december  level 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage  which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
when we use historical usage  this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances 
at december   inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million  or of gross first in  first out inventory cost 
this percentage has decreased from in the fiscal year ended december  we expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory 
most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale  typically months 
future warranty obligations are evaluated using  among other factors  historical cost experience  product evolution and customer feedback 
at december   the reserve for future warranty obligations was million 
our expense for warranty obligations was less than of net sales for each of the years ended december   december   and december  revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project 
during the year ended december   we recognized revenue of approximately million using this method  primarily for major turn key  longer term toll and traffic and energy projects 
approximately million and million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
at december  approximately million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized 
contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 
we expected the significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentage of completion accounting in as transcore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method and we expect this higher level to continue in the future 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
during  our effective income tax rate was  which included a million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings 
in  our effective income tax rate was which included a million additional r d credit 
we expect our tax rate in to increase to approximately as the company does not expect a recurrence of s reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings 
roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized 
amortization of intangible assets  if applicable  occurs over their estimated useful lives 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june  and establishes a two step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
no impairment resulted from the annual review performed in sfas also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized  but separately tested for impairment using a one step fair value based approach 
total goodwill includes different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than million to approximately million 
results of operations general the following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated

includes results of inovonics from february  and transcore from december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were billion as compared to sales of million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth 
our results included a full year of sales from the power generation business of r d tech and from transcore  both acquired during  approximately ten months of sales from the inovonics acquisition  six months from civco  and one month from medtec 
net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately million of our net sales increase over and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions  increased sales of approximately million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our customers and increased sales of our non destructive testing technology into new channels representing approximately million 
net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by million or for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets  representing approximately million  and increased sales of standard products in our water and waste water pumps of approximately million 
in our energy systems and controls segment  net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the power generation business of r d tech acquired in of approximately million 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of million or for the year ended december  over the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the partial year impact of civco and medtec acquired in which accounted for approximately million of the increase over prior year 
the remainder of the increase resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets 
in our rf technology segment  net sales for the year ended december  increased by million over the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the full year results of transcore  purchased december   and the ten month results of inovonics 
our overall gross profit percentage was for the year ended december  which remained the same as for the year ended december  the instrumentation segment gross margins increased to as compared to in the prior year 
the margins improved due to sales mix and leverage from increased sales 
industrial technology gross margins increased to as compared to in the prior year  primarily due to the non recurrence of inventory step up costs at neptune in the first quarter of of approximately million 
our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were in as compared to in this was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable  including a product rationalization effort in our non destructive testing business  better large project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas business 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were in as compared to in this decrease is due totally to inventory step up costs of approximately million at civco and medtec incurred in without these charges  there was a modest improvement in this segment s gross margins for the year 
our rf technology segment gross margins were in as compared to for the day period that transcore was owned in prior year gross margins were depressed due to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to of net sales for the year ended december  from of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses 
interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the transcore acquisition in december  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the inovonics  civco and medtec acquisitions in the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  was a million non cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which are required to be classified as short term debt  based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the company s stock 
the loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  was a million non cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of transcore 
the change in other income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our imaging segment businesses 
during  our effective income tax rate was  which included a million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section of the internal revenue code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings 
in  our effective income tax rate was which included a million additional r d credit 
we expect our tax rate in to increase to approximately as the company does not expect a recurrence of the reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december  the net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of million in the year period ending december  approximately million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 
for the entire year of  operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in non us currencies 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december  and dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   rf technology   n m total   industrial technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for neptune water meter and rf products  which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below 
scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of civco and medtec and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and handheld computers  which leads to the higher backlog at in the scientific and industrial imaging segment 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december  and dollar amounts in thousands 
roper s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   rf technology   total   year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to sales of million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth 
our results included a full year of sales from the ntgh acquisition  six months of sales from the power generation business of r d tech and two weeks of sales from the transcore acquisition 
net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately million of our net sales increase over and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales for the year ended december  increased by million or over the year ended december  the increase was attributable to improved distribution  new product introductions  favorable market conditions  and changes in exchange rates 
net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended december  the increase primarily resulted from the ntgh acquisition  accounting for approximately million of the increase  and also included stronger sales into industrial  energy  and commercial refrigeration end markets 
in our energy systems and controls segment  net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or over the twelve months ended december  the increase was due to the partial year impact of the power generation business of r d tech acquired in of approximately million as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications  substantially offset by lower sales to gazprom 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to the full year impact of ntgh acquired in our rf technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of with the acquisition of transcore on december  and includes two weeks of sales in our overall gross profit percentage was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to as compared to in the prior year 
the margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin  but good operating profit margins 
as expected  industrial technology gross margins decreased  to as compared to in the prior year  because ntgh gross margins are lower than the segment average 
our energy systems and controls segment gross margins were in as compared to in this was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our non destructive testing business 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were in as compared to in this increase is due to improved margins in our high performance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes  much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to of net sales for the year ended december  from of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year 
this was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the ntgh acquisition in december income taxes were of pretax earnings in compared to for our rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing 
our rate also included an additional million credit related to a r d study completed during the year 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at december  this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of million in the twelve month period ending december  approximately million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 
operating earnings benefited from stronger non us currencies 
foreign exchange differences related to our other non us subsidiaries were immaterial to financial performance 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december  and dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   rf technology  nm total   instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment 
in addition  approximately of the increase was due to the stronger european and asian currencies against the dollar 
industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for neptune which were not included in the prior year 
energy systems and controls net orders rose due to strength in the non destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of r d tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year 
in addition  there was continued strength in non gazprom oil and gas sectors  offset by significantly lower gazprom orders 
scientific and industrial imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december  and dollar amounts in thousands 
roper s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   rf technology  total   the increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the transcore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  results include a million write off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the company 
the increase reflects stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of transcore  inovonics  civco  medtec in  strong growth from our other operations  and lower cash tax payments due primarily to the utilization of certain us net operating losses for tax purposes 
cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal   and were primarily business acquisition costs 
cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and common stock issuances in and financing activities in also included amending and restating our previous million credit agreement with our current billion credit agreement to increase capacity  lower borrowing costs  and improve other terms and conditions 
net working capital current assets  excluding cash  less total current liabilities  excluding debt was million at december  compared to million at december  we acquired approximately million of net current assets through business acquisitions during total debt was million at december  of total capital compared to million at december  of total capital 
our increased debt at december  compared to december  was due to borrowings related to our acquisitions 
our billion credit facility consists of a million term loan and a million revolving loan  both with five year maturities 
at december   our debt consisted of million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in  a balance of million on the term loan and a balance of million on the revolving loan 
the company had million of outstanding letters of credit at december   thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately 
we expect that our available borrowing capacity  combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses  will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions 
we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non us businesses 
in total  these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december  capital expenditures of million  million and million were incurred during  and  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures in was primarily due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of transcore acquired in december  we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to description of certain indebtedness senior secured credit facility concurrently with the closing of the transcore acquisition and the common stock offering in december  we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility 
this credit facility consists of a five year million term loan and a five year million revolving loan 
our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and  in certain cases  reduce the commitments under the revolving loan  upon the receipt of certain proceeds  including from certain asset sales  the incurrence of certain debt  and up to of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test 
we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 
the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur new debt  prepay subordinated debt  make certain investments and acquisitions  sell assets and grant liens  make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures  or change our line of business 
we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
senior subordinated convertible notes in december  we issued million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of  resulting in an effective yield of per year to maturity 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually  beginning july   until january  after that date  we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable 
instead  after january   interest will be recognized at the effective rate of and will represent accrual of original issue discount  excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable 
we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january  if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price  accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest  if any  for such note 
the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations  rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 
as originally issued  each  principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock giving effect to the for stock split effective august  and subject to further adjustment  if i the sale price of our common stock reaches  or the trading price of the notes falls below  specified thresholds  ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred 
upon conversion  we would have the right to deliver  in lieu of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
on november   the company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes  but would change how the conversion value is paid 
in lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion  noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and  at the company s option  any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock 
the consent solicitation was successfully completed on december  and the amended conversion provisions were adopted 
holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january   january   january   january   and january   at stated prices plus accrued cash interest  if any  including contingent cash interest  if any 
we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock 
we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after january  at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest  if any  including contingent cash interest  if any  on such notes to the applicable redemption date 
as of september   the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on october  based upon the company s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least trading days during the consecutive trading day period ending on september  in accordance with eitf  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share  the company is required to include in its diluted weighted average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the company s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of 
this is calculated using the treasury stock method 
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  dollars in thousands 
payments due in fiscal contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt      capital leases    operating leases      total      includes in million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability however  the company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next months 
amounts expiring in fiscal other commercial commitments total amount committed thereafter standby letters of credit and bank guarantees    at december  the company had outstanding surety bonds of million 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although we maintain an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities  financial condition and results of operations 
we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 
we anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule 
however  the rate at which we can reduce our debt during and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies 
none of these factors can be predicted with certainty 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued fas  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and material waste 
the standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period charges 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december   the fasb issued fas r  share based payment revised sfas r which was originally effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  the effective date of this standard has been delayed until annual reporting periods beginning after december   which was the company s calendar year beginning on january  sfas r applies to any unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and to all new awards granted or modified after the effective date 
the remaining unrecognized portion of the original fair value of the unvested awards will be recognized in the income statement at their fair value that the company estimated for purposes of preparing its sfas pro forma disclosures 
the company adopted sfas r on january  and applied the modified prospective transition method 
this method requires the company to expense the remaining unrecognized portion of awards outstanding at the effective date and to expense any awards granted or modified after the effective date  but does not require restatement of prior periods 
in accordance with fasb staff position fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  the company anticipates applying the short cut method for determining its additional paid in capital pool  however the company continues to evaluate such implementation 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r as of january   the company estimates it will record expense of approximately million in fiscal relating to its stock based awards

fsp is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the directive s adoption into law by the applicable eu member countries in which the manufacturers have significant operations 
the company adopted fsp in the third quarter of fiscal and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition for fiscal information about forward looking statements this annual report includes and incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
in addition  we  or our executive officers on our behalf  may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press  potential investors or others 
all statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
the words estimate  project  intend  expect  believe  anticipate  and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position  business  financing plans  business strategy  business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs and income  in each case relating to our company as a whole  as well as statements regarding acquisitions  potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions 
forward looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions  which in turn are based on currently available information 
examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions 
important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include  among others  assumptions regarding demand for our products  the cost  timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions  raw materials costs  expected pricing levels  the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures  expected outcomes of pending litigation  competitive conditions  general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions  joint ventures and alliances 
these assumptions could prove inaccurate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 
at december   we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings 
our billion senior credit facility contains million variable rate term notes and a million variable rate revolver 
to reduce the financial risk of future rate increases  in the company entered into a million fixed rate swap agreement expiring march  our million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate 
at december   the prevailing market rates were between and higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments 
at december   roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the billion credit facility were million 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our annualized interest costs by million 
several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros  canadian dollars  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were of our total sales and of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency 
the us dollar strengthened against european and asian currencies during and weakened against the canadian dollar 
the difference between operating results for these companies translated into us dollars during and these operating results translated into us dollars during was not material 
if these currency exchange rates had been different throughout compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced  the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately million 
the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during compared to currency exchange rates at december  resulted in a decrease in net assets of million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings  million of which was attributed to goodwill 
goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 
the trading price of roper s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements 
the stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share 
the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock 
we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable
