the indentures the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes the notes contain certain customary financial and other covenants  which limit our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt 
at december   our consolidated coverage ratio as defined in the indentures was to

and  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a liability of million and million as of december  and  respectively  representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding decrease in long term debt  as these interest rate swaps are considered highly effective under the criteria established by sfas no

the dividend was paid on october  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one hundredth of a share of series a preferred stock  par value per share preferred shares at a price of per one one hundredth of a preferred share  subject to adjustment 
the rights are not exercisable until the earlier of days following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons have acquired beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock acquiring person or business days or such later date as may be determined by action of the board of directors prior to such time as any person or group of affiliated persons becomes an acquiring person following the commencement of  or announcement of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer  the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of or more of our outstanding common stock 
the rights will expire on october  acquiring persons do not have the same rights to receive common stock as other holders upon exercise of the rights 
because of the nature of the preferred shares dividend  liquidation and voting rights  the value of one one hundredth interest in a preferred share purchasable upon exercise of each right should approximate the value of one common share

because of the characteristics of the rights in connection with a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming an acquiring person  the rights may have the effect of making an acquisition of the company more difficult and may discourage such an acquisition 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the determination of slot club program liability  the estimated useful lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodology we apply  our significant accounting policies and basis of presentation are discussed below  as well as where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
slot club programs our boarding pass and amigo club player rewards programs the programs allow customers to redeem points earned from their gaming activity at all station and fiesta properties for complimentary food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise 
at the time redeemed  the retail value of complimentaries under the programs are recorded as revenue with a corresponding offsetting amount included in promotional allowances 
the cost associated with complimentary food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise redeemed under the programs is recorded in casino costs and expenses 
we also record a liability for the estimated cost of the outstanding points under the programs that we believe will ultimately be redeemed 
self insurance reserves we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for workers compensation and general liability costs 
we are also self insured for major medical claims 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
interest rate swaps from time to time we enter into interest rate swaps in order to manage interest rate risks associated with our current and future borrowings 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and as amended by sfas no 
and to account for our interest rate swaps 
the pronouncements require us to recognize our interest rate swaps as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheets at fair value 
the accounting for changes in fair value ie gains or losses of the interest rate swap agreements depends on whether is has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
the difference between amounts received and paid under such agreements as well as any costs or fees  is recorded as a reduction of  or an addition to  interest expense as incurred over the life of the swap 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion  if any  is recorded in the statement of operations 
derivative instruments that are designated as a fair value hedge and qualify for the shortcut method under sfas and as amended by sfas no 
and allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such there is no income statement impact from the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the capitalized lease  whichever is less 
costs of major improvements are capitalized  while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset to be sold at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal 
fair market value for assets to be disposed of is generally estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review fixed assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
if an indicator of impairment exists  we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value  with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model 
our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments required by sfas no 
as of december  goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test for impairment of goodwill annually using the income approach  which focuses on the income producing capability of the respective property 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to the respective property and converting these after tax cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return  which accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors 
the present value of the after tax cash flows is then totaled to arrive at an indication of the fair value of the goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying value  then impairment is measured based on the difference between the calculated fair value and the carrying value 
our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments required by sfas no 
as of december  income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states of america and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on alternative fair value models 
the share based compensation cost will be measured based on fair value models of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we currently disclose pro forma compensation expense quarterly and annually by calculating the stock option grants fair value using the black scholes model and disclosing the impact on net income and earnings per share in a note to the consolidated financial statements 
upon adoption  pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we will begin to apply sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method as of the interim reporting period ending march  as provided by the securities exchange commission announcement on april  which amended the effective date 
based on stock options outstanding as of december   we estimate approximately million in expense to be recorded during  million in and virtually zero thereafter 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
under eitf  the general partners in a limited partnership or similar entity are presumed to control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the general partners ownership interest in the limited partnership 
a general partner should assess the limited partners rights and their impact on the presumption of control 
if the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or b substantive participating rights  the general partners do not control the limited partnership 
for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreement is modified  eitf is effective june  for general partners in all other limited partnerships  eitf is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december   and allows either of two transition methods 
the company does not believe that eitf will have a significant impact on its results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under the revolving facility 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a margin above the alternate base rate or the eurodollar rate each as defined in the revolving facility as selected by us 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate and may be reduced from time to time 
the revolving facility matures in december the following table provides information about our long term debt at december  see also description of certain indebtedness and capital stock amounts in thousands maturity date face amount carrying value estimated fair value revolving facility at a weighted average interest rate of approximately december senior subordinated notes february senior notes april senior subordinated notes march other debt weighted average interest of market value of interest rate swaps total we are also exposed to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates and their potential impact upon our debt 
this market risk is managed by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace  and do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our derivative financial instruments consist exclusively of interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched with specific debt obligations
