o asset management

insurance services 
through insurance services we provide management and agency services to medical malpractice insurance companies through the following subsidiary o fmi 
fmi provides management and administrative services to apie  a regional insurance exchange that sells medical professional liability insurance only to its physician subscribers  who pay annual insurance premiums and surplus contributions to apie 
apie is governed by a physician board of directors 
pursuant to a management agreement and the direction of this board  fmi manages and operates apie  including performing policy issuance  claims investigation and settlement  and all other management and operational functions 
as a management fee  fmi receives a percentage of apie s earned premiums and a portion of apie s profit  subject to a cap based on premium levels 
we recognize revenues for the management fee portion based on a percentage of earned premium on a monthly basis 
we recognize revenues for the management fee portion based on profit sharing in the fourth quarter  when it is certain the managed company will have an annual profit 
fmi s assets are not subject to apie policyholder claims 
in addition  as of december   we have the following significant investments accounted for as available for sale securities we own approximately  shares of healthtronics common stock  representing less than of its outstanding common stock  we own  shares of fic  representing approximately of its outstanding common stock 
our policy is to account for investments as available for sale securities 
this requires that we assess fluctuations in fair value and determine whether these fluctuations are temporary or other than temporary as defined in statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
temporary changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
should a decline in an investment be deemed other than temporary  as was the case with our investment with fic in both and  pre tax charges to earnings will be taken in the period in which the impairment is considered to be other than temporary 
we also have investments totaling  in low risk governmental and corporate fixed income securities 
these securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
as above  we would recognize an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other than temporary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of assets  bad debts  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections  which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
management may also obtain independent valuations 
our financial services revenues are composed primarily of commissions on securities trades 
revenues related to securities transactions are recognized on a trade date basis 
our insurance services revenues are primarily related to management fees based on the earned premiums of the managed company and include a profit sharing component  as defined in the management agreement  related to the managed company s annual earnings 
management fees are recorded  based upon the terms of the management agreement  in the period the related premiums are earned by the managed company 
the managed company recognizes premiums as earned ratably over the terms of the related policy 
the profit sharing component is recognized in the fourth quarter when it is certain the managed company will have an annual profit 
when necessary  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowance may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customers credit standing or rating could have a material affect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value because they mature in less than days and do not present unanticipated credit concerns 
when necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period the determination was made 
we account for our equity and fixed income securities as available for sale 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the quoted market prices at the end of a period  the length of time an investment s fair value has been in decline and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded against earnings 
results of operations overview and business outlook aps financial  the broker dealer division of our financial services segment  saw strong growth in its investment banking division in while commission revenues from security trading mirrored those recorded in aps clearing  which represents a new revenue stream  was formed in from commissions earned on the trading and clearing of non security transactions in bank debt and trade claims 
the investment banking department was ramped up in with the hiring of a dedicated investment banker who was successful in closing several private placement transactions 
commission revenues from investment grade trading was flat in a soft investment climate  while revenues from non investment grade high yield trades saw an increase  particularly in the latter half of the year 
for commission revenue generation  bullish  unstable markets provide us with the most opportunity 
conversely  stable  bearish markets pose the greatest difficulty in generating income 
uncertainty in world  political and economic events can also be an obstacle to revenue generation 
investors may take a wait and see attitude should uncertainty exist 
although we have been fortunate in retaining our key salespersons for many years  a loss of one or more key individuals and or a loss of one or more key accounts is possible and could have a material adverse effect upon earnings 
the nature of the broker dealer business and the current litigious legal environment in which we operate means that there is always the possibility of one or more lawsuits being brought against us 
claims against broker dealers generally rise in periods of down markets and the more prolonged a downturn  generally the greater risk of litigation 
aps insurance services enjoyed a record year in in revenues 
total surplus at apie grew approximately in compared to if apie s surplus continues to grow  this would continue to increase the financial strength of the company and its capacity to write new business and therefore increase the amount of profit in which we would be able to share 
for  we expect non variable operating expenses to increase over  primarily as a result of anticipated new personnel hires required to support estimated growth in new business 
professional fees may be higher or lower depending upon final resolution by the sec as to whether or not micro cap companies are exempt from compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of our insurance segment is greatly affected by the profitability of the medical malpractice insurance company that we manage 
significant increases in claims brought against our insured doctors would negatively affect the profitability of apie  and consequently  the amount of profit  if any  we would be able to share in 
this risk has been reduced by lowering the limits of liability on the physicians apie insures coupled with providing policies that cap our overall exposure 
further  there was passage of tort and insurance reform in the state of texas in the new legislation capped non economic damages and placed restrictions on mass litigation 
as a result of tort reform  competitors have begun to re enter the state of texas  which could result in pressure to lower rates or a reduction in the number of insurance policies written by apie 
although consolidated net earnings were up substantially in compared to the two previous years  combined net earnings from our two core segments was down slightly in compared to the primary reason for the large increase in consolidated net earnings is the result of unusually high gains on the sales of our investments in and unusually high other than temporary impairments charges of investments recorded in such gains and losses are not likely to be repeated 
there were no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and compared to revenues from operations increased  in compared to our operating income decreased  to  compared to  in our net earnings increased  in to a total of  compared to net earnings of  in our diluted earnings per share increased to in compared to in the reasons for these changes are described below 
financial services our financial services revenues increased  in compared to the increase was mostly due to contributions from our investment banking and bank debt trading businesses  which were up a combined  from last year 
of this increase  bank debt trading generated revenues of  in  its first year of operations  with minimal start up costs 
this increase  combined with commission revenue from secondary market securities trading  which was up slightly from  made aps financial s second best year in revenues in its twenty four year history 
our broker dealer business derives most of its revenue from trading in the secondary fixed income market  both in investment and non investment grade securities 
commission revenue from our investment grade market segment was lower  as the federal reserve raised short term rates times for a total of basis points since mid the short end of the treasury yield curve  in step with federal reserve tightening  traded to higher yields  while the longer end of the curve hovered near historically low levels  creating a flat to slightly inverted yield curve in this created an investment environment where customers continued to be cautious to commit funds in  particularly to longer maturing instruments  thus negatively impacting trading revenues 
the decline in our investment grade business was offset by increased activity in the high yield markets 
in  the us high yield markets  which were generally considered rich the previous year  began to correct with some volatility  increasing our trading revenues from this market segment 
our financial services expense increased  in compared to commission expense  which includes commissions from secondary market trading  as well as placement fees for investment banking and referral fees for bank debt trading  was up  as a result of the above mentioned increase in commission revenue 
payroll was up  in part due to the hiring of additional personnel in the investment banking and bank debt trading areas as the firm ramped up these business efforts  and due to an increase in performance related forgivable loans 
legal and professional expenses increased  from the previous year  principally due to expenses associated with our efforts to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in incentive compensation expense of  in compared to as a result of higher minimum performance thresholds placed upon management in insurance services our insurance services revenues from our premium based insurance management segment  aps insurance services  increased  in compared to the primary reason for the current year increase was a  increase in management fees  the result of greater insurance premium volumes 
earned premium increased at apie by in compared to primarily as a result of new business  which saw an net increase in the number of insured professionals  and because of strong retention of our existing business in the current year 
in addition  profits shared with apie grew  to  in from  in consistent with our revenue recognition policy  this revenue was not recognized until the fourth quarter of the year after profit sharing goals were attained 
as the certainty of profits at apie cannot be fully known until an end of year actuarial analysis by independent actuaries  we cannot predict what  if any  profits will be available to us until this analysis is complete 
partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in risk management fee income in compared to  the result of a lower number of renewals utilizing this service 
also  pass through commissions earned by third party agents decreased  in to  compared to  in  the result of a decline in written premiums in the current year 
written premiums are down in compared to as a result of lower new business written during the year along with an average decrease in premium rates of 
as noted below  commissions paid to third party independent agents decreased by an equivalent amount  resulting in no impact on net earnings 
insurance services expenses at our insurance management subsidiary increased  in compared to the primary reasons for the current year increase were higher payroll and higher professional fees 
payroll increased  in as a result of normal merit raises as well as the addition of two new managerial positions 
professional fees increased  in compared to primarily as a result of fees paid in association with sarbanes oxley act compliance requirements 
in addition  depreciation increased  in compared to due to a significant increase in capital purchases made during the current year necessary to upgrade our management information and reporting capabilities 
partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in commissions expense due to the above mentioned increase in commissions paid to third party independent agents 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the current year increase was due primarily to a  increase in incentive compensation expense in resulting from additional contractual bonuses that will be paid on the greater gains from the sale of a higher number of shares of healthtronics common stock completed in in addition  salaries expense increased  in partially due to a severance payment to a former employee who has since been retained as a tax consultant coupled with an addition in salaries at the executive level above the norm in an effort to remain competitive in the marketplace 
professional fees increased  in compared to as a result of fees paid in association with sarbanes oxley act compliance requirements 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in legal fees of   the result of lower utilization of legal consulting in as well as fees paid in in association with a form s filing that were not necessary in gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets primarily represents the recognition of deferred income 
during  we recognized approximately  of deferred gain related to the november sale and subsequent leaseback of real estate to prime medical its name prior to the merger with healthtronics  inc due to our continuing involvement in the property  we deferred recognizing approximately  of the approximately  gain and are recognizing it in earnings  as a reduction of rent expense  monthly through november a total of  remains to be recognized 
in addition  of the gain  related to our then ownership in the purchaser  was deferred 
as our ownership percentage in healthtronics declines through our sales of healthtronics common stock  we recognize these gains proportionately to our reduction of our interest in that company 
during  we recognized  of these deferred gains  leaving a balance of approximately  remaining to be recognized 
the increase in is the result of an increased number of healthtronics common stock shares sold compared to gain on investments gain on investments increased   in compared to the current year increase in primarily due to gains on the sale of a greater number of shares of healthtronics common stock compared to in addition  we recorded income of  from an investment in a private company that was sold during and in which we had a zero basis 
partially offsetting these gains was a write off totaling  from an investment loan that was given earlier in information provided by the third party loan obligor at the time of the loan was proven to be less than complete and it was determined in september   after the loan was several months in default  that it is unlikely that we will recover any of the remaining debt owed us 
as such  the balance of the loan was written off 
loss on impairment of investments the current year loss was due to a write down of our investment in fic common stock coupled with an impairment of our investment in toys r us bonds 
the loss in represents an impairment in the value of our investment in fic common stock 
during  the value of our investment in fic had declined significantly 
in october  we determined that this decline in market price should be considered other than temporary as defined in statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as amended 
consequently  we recorded pre tax charges to earnings totaling  in these charges reduced our cost basis in fic from  or per share  to  or per share which was equal to the quoted market price of fic shares on december  during  we took additional pre tax charges to earnings totaling  further reducing our cost basis in fic to  or per share 
while we currently continue to have the ability and the intent to hold the stock indefinitely  we concluded that the additional uncertainty created by fic s late filings  together with the lack of its current financial information  dictated that the and declines should be viewed as other than temporary 
in july  fic was able to file its form k but has yet to file any or forms q or k and thus continues to be de listed on the nasdaq stock market 
in april  we purchased  of toys r us bonds 
in march  toys r us announced a plan of merger with another toy company and a planned leveraged buyout  which precipitated a drop in the price of the bonds 
an independent analysis indicated that the new debt to be issued in connection with the leveraged buyout will put the existing bonds in a subordinated position 
since these bonds have a maturity  we believe that the impairment is other than temporary during our shorter than expected holding period 
consequently  we wrote a charge against pre tax earnings of  using the quoted price of the bonds as of june  by december  the value of the bonds had declined further and  based in part upon weak earnings reports  we determined that an additional impairment charge of  was necessary using the quoted price of the bonds as of december  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the situations at both fic and toys r us and further determine if changes in fair market value of these investments are temporary or other than temporary 
gain on the extinguishment of debt during and  we recorded  and  respectively  as gains on extinguishment of debt 
the amount represents that amount of liability that was released by participants in our loan to a former affiliate 
due to poor operating results  the affiliate was in default and not making scheduled payments under its loan agreement with us in which the participations had been sold 
as a result  the loan participants released us from any obligations under the participation agreements 
in september  we determined there is a remote possibility that the final obligation  totaling  will be required to be paid under the terms of the participation agreement and as a result  we reversed it and recognized a gain in the same amount 
interest income our interest income increased  in compared to primarily as a result of a higher balance of interest bearing securities held in as well as to higher average interest rates 
at december   we held a balance of  in fixed income securities versus a balance of  at december  the increase in was primarily attributable to cash received upon the sale of equity securities 
other income loss our other income increased  in compared to the increase in was due to net gains in inventory held briefly at aps financial in totaling  versus net inventory losses of  in in addition  we received  in administrative fee income from eco systems in versus  in resulting from their increase in earnings in the current year 
minority interests for the years and  minority interests represents a interest in asset management  a subsidiary within our financial services segment  owned by key individuals within asset management 
minority interests increased in the current year due to a prior period adjustment resulting from our acquisition of a former minority interest shareholder 
cash flows our cash flows provided from operations decreased  in compared to due in part to the receipt of  in profit sharing from apie in december with the remainder received in early none of the profit sharing was received in in addition  we paid nearly  more in federal income taxes in than in  the result of taxes owed on much larger gains on investments 
our cash flows used in investing activities decreased  in as a result of lower capital expenditures as well as increased net receipt of loans over the amount funded 
our cash used in financing activities increased  in primarily as a result of a  increase in the purchase of our treasury stock compared to partially offsetting this was a  increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options 
compared to revenues from operations increased  compared to our operating income increased  to  in compared to  in our net earnings decreased  in to a total of  compared to net earnings of  in our diluted earnings per share decreased to in compared to in the reasons for these changes are described below 
financial services our financial services revenues decreased  in compared to although commission revenues in were the second highest in aps financial s twenty three year history  they were down compared to  which saw record commission revenues at aps financial 
our broker dealer derives most of its revenue from trading in the fixed income market  both in investment and non investment grade securities 
revenue from both grade securities was lower 
investment grade markets are typically linked to treasury rates  which continued to trade in at a historically low yield levels 
customers have been cautious on committing funds  particularly to longer maturing instruments  thus negatively impacting trading revenues 
also  in the us high yield markets were almost universally considered over valued  trading at historically low spreads to treasuries 
again  this contributed to a reluctance of our customers to commit funds  and contributed to lower revenues 
our financial services expense decreased  in compared to the primary reason for the current year decrease is a  decrease in commission expense resulting from the decrease in commission revenue at aps financial mentioned above 
in addition  net profits before management incentive costs decreased at aps financial by  resulting in a  decrease in the current year formula driven incentive compensation costs 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in payroll costs of  in resulting from normal annual merit raises as well as the hiring of two new full time positions 
in addition  there were relatively minor current year increases in employee benefits  professional fees and information services 
insurance services our insurance services revenues from our premium based insurance management segment  aps insurance services  increased  in compared to one of the primary reasons for the current year growth is an increase of  in profits shared with apie 
the total amount of profit sharing recognized in was  all of which was recognized during the fourth quarter of  after profit sharing goals were attained 
in  we recognized all of that year s total of  in profit sharing during the fourth quarter as well 
as the certainty of profits at apie cannot be fully known until an end of year actuarial analysis by independent actuaries  we cannot predict what  if any  profits will be available to us until this analysis is complete 
another main reason for the growth in revenues in was a  increase in management fees resulting from greater insurance premium volumes 
earned premium increased at apie by in compared to primarily as a result of new business and strong retention of our existing business in the current year 
lastly  commission income increased  in compared to  resulting from approximately  in additional written premium in the current year 
as noted below  commissions paid to third party independent agents increased by an equivalent amount  resulting in no impact on net income 
insurance services expenses at our insurance management subsidiary increased  in compared to the current year increase is primarily due to the  increase in commissions paid to third party independent agents 
in addition  payroll expense increased  and formula driven incentive compensation expense increased  in compared to payroll expense was up in the current year due primarily to normal annual merit raises in addition to personnel additions made in the latter half of that were expensed the entire year in among the additions was a high level management position to help meet our growing financial reporting requirements 
the increase in formula driven incentive compensation cost was the result of an increase in segment operating profits 
excluding incentive compensation costs  pre tax profits at our insurance segment rose  
lastly  depreciation and amortization costs were  higher in compared to as a result of amortizing the non compete agreement that was created upon the repurchase of the minority interest in october for a full year compared to only three months in partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in advertising in compared to  a result of re branding efforts of the business performed in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to the current year increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense which was  greater in on substantially higher operating income in the current year 
other professional fees were  higher in primarily as a result of fees incurred in connection with sarbanes oxley act internal control procedures 
also  director s fees increased  as a result of a higher fee structure implemented in as well as an increased number of board and committee meetings compared to partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in legal fees of  in  the result of non recurring fees incurred in in connection with our investment in fic 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets primarily represents the recognition of deferred income 
approximately  of the  deferred gain on the sale of real estate to prime medical its name prior to the merger with healthtronics  inc in was due to our ownership interest in prime medical and is recognized upon the reduction of our ownership percentage in prime medical through the sale of its stock 
in  we recognized approximately  from the sale of a higher number of shares of prime medical common stock versus  when a gain of  was recorded 
gain on investments gain on investments increased  in compared to as a result of gains from the sale of a greater number of available for sale equity securities sold in the current year 
loss from impairment of investments the current year loss was due to a write down of our investment in fic common stock 
during  in accordance with sfas  we determined that the decline in market value of fic common stock was other than temporary and we recorded pre tax charges to earnings totaling  these charges reduced our cost basis in fic from  or per share  to  or per share which is equal to the quoted market price of fic shares on december  we believe the decline in the market price of fic has been brought about by its failure to file its form k and its subsequent de listing from the nasdaq stock market 
we had expected fic to bring its filings current and pursue restoring its exchange listing but these events have not yet occurred 
while we currently continue to have the ability and the intent to hold the stock indefinitely  we have concluded that the additional uncertainty created by the late filings together with the lack of current financial information dictates that the decline should be viewed as other than temporary 
affiliates earnings loss our equity in the earnings of prime medical its name prior to the merger with healthtronics  inc was zero in as well as in as we no longer account for our investment in prime medical using the equity method of accounting  as was the case in the first quarter of when we recorded  in equity earnings 
as of march   we ceased accounting for our investment in prime medical using the equity method of accounting because on january   kenneth s 
shifrin  our chairman and ceo  stepped down from day to day operations as executive chairman of the board of prime medical  but continued to serve as non executive chairman 
mr 
shifrin further reduced his responsibilities on prime s board to vice chairman in  and from january to march   we sold  shares of prime medical common stock reducing our ownership percentage in to approximately 
our equity in earnings of uncommon care was zero in   in and a loss of  in because our total investment and advances to uncommon care has been reduced to zero  we suspended recording equity losses  as required under the equity method 
in  we advanced them  and recorded a loss for the full amount of the advance 
in  after informing uncommon care s management that we would make no further advances  we recorded equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in the amount of  related to cash received from uncommon care 
we expect no further receipts of cash from uncommon care and consequently expect to record no additional income in the future 
interest income our interest income increased  in compared to primarily as a result of a higher balance of interest bearing securities held in at december   we had a balance of  in fixed income securities versus a balance of  at december  other income loss our other income increased  in as a result of a write down taken in totaling  on an equity investment 
partially offsetting this was a decrease of  in administrative fee income from eco systems in resulting from their decreased earnings 
minority interests minority interests represents the combination of two outside interests in our subsidiaries a interest in insurance services owned by fpic insurance group  inc and a interest in aps asset management or apsam  a subsidiary within our financial services segment  owned by key individuals within aps asset management 
minority interests decreased in the current year due to the repurchase of the minority interest in insurance services from the minority interest holder  fpic insurance group  effective october  consequently  only nine months of minority interest was recorded in compared to a full year in during  minority interest was recorded only at apsam and amounted to just  discontinued operations effective november   aps consulting paid off the negotiated remaining amount of the note payable to us 
even though we had sold this segment to aps consulting s management exactly one year earlier  we continued to consolidate their revenues  expenses and balance sheet items because we were dependent upon future successful operations of the division to collect our proceeds from the disposal and we did not transfer risk of loss to discontinue reporting them on our consolidated financial statements 
with the payoff of the note  we recognized the divesture and now report aps consulting as a discontinued operation 
accordingly  has been reclassified to remove revenues and expenses from our consolidated statements of operations and after tax results of this former division are now recorded as income from discontinued operations in for  only the after tax gain on disposal of the segment is recorded as earnings from aps consulting 
there was no effect in cash flows for the year ended december  our cash provided by operations increased  compared to as a result of the increase in operating income at our insurance services segment 
cash used in investing activities increased  in compared to as a result of proceeds from the sale of available for sale equity securities during  which were much greater than those received in cash provided by financing activities decreased  in as a result of fewer options exercised compared to  a greater number of treasury stock shares purchased during and cash dividends paid in liquidity and capital resources working capital our net working capital was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the current year was due primarily to the purchase of short term fixed income securities through the sale of long term equity securities 
in addition  we received  in cash from operations 
historically  we have maintained a strong working capital position and  as a result  we have been able to satisfy our operational and capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from our operating and investing activities 
these same sources of funds have also allowed us to pursue investment and expansion opportunities consistent with our growth plans 
although there can be no assurance our operating activities will provide positive cash flow in  we are optimistic that our working capital requirements will be met for the foreseeable future for the following reasons our current cash position is very strong  with a balance of approximately million comprising of our total assets  our investments in available for sale equity and fixed income securities could provide an additional million should the need arise  and we renewed a line of credit in april that is described below 
line of credit during april  we renewed a million line of credit that was originally established in november with plainscapital bank 
the loan calls for interest payments only to be made on any amount drawn until april   when the entire amount of the note  principal and interest then remaining unpaid  shall be due and payable 
at december   there were no draws taken against this line of credit 
we are in compliance with the covenants of the loan agreement  including requirements for a minimum of million of unencumbered liquidity and a minimum to net worth ratio 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures for equipment were  and  in and  respectively 
our capital expenditures were higher than normal in and due to purchases necessary to upgrade our reporting software at our insurance services subsidiary 
we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately  all of which is expected to be funded through cash on hand 
commitments there were no participation agreements or purchase commitments at december  we have committed cash outflow related to operating lease arrangements with a term exceeding one to five years at december   as follows in thousands payment due contractual cash obligation total operating leases margin loans we extend credit to our customers  which is financed through our clearing organization  southwest securities  inc or southwest  to help facilitate customer securities transactions 
this credit  which earns interest income  is known as margin lending 
in margin transactions  the client pays a portion of the purchase price of securities  and we make a loan financed by our clearing organization to the client for the balance  collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client 
in permitting clients to purchase on margin  we are subject to the risk of a market decline  which could reduce the value of our collateral below the client s indebtedness 
agreements with margin account clients permit our clearing organization to liquidate our clients securities with or without prior notice in the event of an insufficient amount of margin collateral 
despite those agreements  our clearing organization may be unable to liquidate clients securities for various reasons including the fact that the pledged securities may not be actively traded  there is an undue concentration of certain securities pledged  or a trading halt is issued with regard to pledged securities 
if the value of the collateral were insufficient to repay the margin loan  a loss would occur  which we may be required to fund 
as of december   the total of all customer securities pledges on debit balances held in margin accounts was approximately million while the total value of the securities within these margin accounts was approximately million 
we are also exposed should southwest be unable to fulfill its obligations for securities transactions 
our ability to make scheduled payments or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that we will realize anticipated revenue growth and operating improvements sufficient to make scheduled payments and fund planned future capital expenditures 
inflation our operations are not significantly affected by inflation because we are not required to make large investments in fixed assets 
however  the rate of inflation will affect certain of our expenses  such as employee compensation and benefits 
impact of new accounting standards as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on july   we are required to adopt several new accounting standards 
for a discussion of the impact of those new accounting standards upon us  see note n

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates and the market values of our investments but have no material exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to both our investment portfolio and our revenues generated through commissions at our financial services segment 
all of our marketable fixed income securities are designated as available for sale and  accordingly  are presented at fair value on our balance sheets 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could have an impact at our broker dealer subsidiary  aps financial 
the general level of interest rates may trend higher or lower in  and this move may impact our level of business in different fixed income sectors 
if a generally improving economy is the impetus behind higher rates  then while our investment grade business may drop off  our high yield business might improve with improving credit conditions 
a volatile interest rate environment in could also impact our business as this type of market condition can lead to investor uncertainty and their corresponding willingness to commit funds 
as we currently have no debt and do not anticipate the need to take on any debt in  interest rate changes will have noimpact on our financial position as it pertains to interest expense 
investment risk as of december   our recorded basis in debt and equity securities was approximately million 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary 
during  the value of one of our investments  fic  had declined significantly 
in october  we determined that this decline in market price should be considered other than temporary as defined in statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as amended 
consequently  we recorded pre tax charges to earnings totaling  in these charges reduced our cost basis in fic from  or per share  to  or per share which was equal to the quoted market price of fic shares on december  during  we took additional pre tax charges to earnings totaling  further reducing our cost basis in fic to  or per share 
while we currently continue to have the ability and the intent to hold the stock indefinitely  we concluded that the additional uncertainty created by fic s late filings  together with the lack of its current financial information  dictated that the and declines should be viewed as other than temporary 
in july  fic was able to file its form k but has yet to file any or forms q or k and thus continues to be de listed on the nasdaq stock market 
the effect on our financial statements as a result of these write downs was as follows reduction in pre tax earnings   reduction in other comprehensive income   reduction in deferred tax assets   we will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation at fic and further determine if changes in fair market value of the investment are temporary or other than temporary 
we also have an investment of  shares of common stock of healthtronics  inc although we have an unrealized gain of approximately  as of december   this investment can also be at risk should market or economic conditions change for the worse or should adverse situations occur at healthtronics  such as a major product line becoming obsolete 
the remainder of our corporate equity and fixed income investments share the same risks as healthtronics but our exposure is much lower
