caustic soda volumes sold were comparable to the prior year 
water treatment segment sales increases were attributable to selling price increases connected with material cost increases and successful expansion of existing product lines in comparison to the prior year 
increased volumes along several existing product lines drove the increase in pharmaceutical segment sales 
sales increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to sales of  for the fiscal year ended march  sales of bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  were approximately of sales compared to in the previous year 
all three operating segments contributed to the increase in sales 
industrial segment sales increased  or  to  water treatment segment sales increased  or  to  and pharmaceutical segment sales increased  or  to  the increase in the industrial segment sales was driven by improved sales along several product lines and an increase in the cost and selling price of caustic soda in comparison to the prior year 
during the fiscal year ended april  there was a decrease in caustic soda volumes sold  which was offset by increases in selling prices associated with increases in the cost of caustic soda 
although the water treatment segment was challenged by cooler summer conditions during the second quarter of fiscal in comparison to the prior year  sales increased due to increased volumes in existing product lines and successful expansion of existing product lines 
increased volumes along several existing product lines drove the increase in pharmaceutical segment sales 
gross margin gross margin  as a percentage of sales  was for the fiscal year ended april  compared to for the fiscal year ended april  and for the fiscal year ended march   respectively 
the gross margin decreases are due to a number of variables as explained below 
industrial segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the industrial segment was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended april  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  relates to changes in the cost and selling price of caustic soda during fiscal and  increased product costs  a highly competitive market environment  and changes in product mix along several product lines 
additionally  since we are on the lifo method of valuing inventory  the increased caustic soda costs and the higher cost of inventory on hand as of april  impacted gross margins 
gross margins for the fiscal year ended april  were flat as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the cost of caustic soda is normally subject to fluctuations  which are expected to continue in future periods 
the company attempts to maintain relatively constant dollar margins as the cost of caustic soda increases or decreases 
therefore  the gross margin percentage will decrease when the cost of the product is increasing and will increase when the cost of the product is decreasing 
water treatment segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the water treatment segment was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended april  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  was primarily attributable to rising product costs  which to some extent  the company was unable to pass on to customers due to competitive pressures 
additionally  due to the lifo method of valuing inventory  the margin was negatively impacted by higher inventory costs and changes in product mix of inventory on hand as compared to the prior year 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the fiscal year ended april  decreased in comparison with the fiscal year ended march  as competitive pressures reduced margins on several products 
additionally  due to the lifo method of valuing inventory  the margin was negatively impacted by higher inventory levels and changes in product mix of inventory on hand as compared to the prior year 
pharmaceutical segment gross margin  as a percentage of sales  for the pharmaceutical segment was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended april  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended april  related primarily to an increase in operating costs for staffing increases to facilitate future growth  changes in product mix and competitive pressures 
gross margins for the fiscal year ended april  were flat as compared to the fiscal year ended march  selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  were  for the fiscal year ended april    for the fiscal year ended april  and  for the fiscal year ended march  the dollar increases in fiscal were mainly due to increased sales staff  and  to a lesser extent  contractor fees associated with the company s efforts in complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act and the company s implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system 
employee compensation and benefits comprise the majority of the selling  general and administrative expenditures 
additionally  in fiscal bad debt expense increased by  due primarily to the bankruptcy of a large customer and the  impairment of intangible assets resulted in an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
litigation settlements in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company paid million to resolve a personal injury lawsuit encaptioned chavarria et al v 
hawkins  inc  panorama compounding pharmacy  and valley drug and compounding  et al that arose from the alleged mislabeling of certain inventory the company purchased in connection with its acquisition of st 
mary s chemicals  inc d b a universal chemicals in may pursuant to the terms of the settlement  the company denied all liability and reserved its right to pursue indemnification and contribution from third parties 
in july  the company filed suit in hennepin county  minnesota against the former principals of universal chemicals  seeking indemnification for the costs the company incurred in defending and resolving the prior litigation 
on june   the company and the former universal chemicals principals the defendants executed a settlement agreement in full and final resolution of the company s claims  as well as any claims the defendants may have or may have had against the company 
the settlement agreement required the defendants to surrender to the company  shares of the company s common stock 
the agreement also terminated the non competition provisions of the company s agreements with the defendants  relieving the company of the obligation to pay  to the defendants over the next five years as consideration for these provisions 
the settlement agreement called for the parties to execute mutual releases and a stipulation of dismissal 
litigation settlement income of  was recorded in the pharmaceutical segment during the quarter ended september  as the company received the  shares and the executed final releases and stipulations 
investment income investment income decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended april  compared to  for the fiscal year ended april  this decrease was primarily related to a  loss recognized due to other than temporary declines in the market value of an investment 
the decrease was partially offset by higher returns on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the  increase in investment income for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  was attributable to an increase in cash available for investment  and a higher rate of return on the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended april   for the fiscal year ended april  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease for the fiscal year ended april  as compared to the fiscal years ended april  and march  was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for adjustments to deferred tax estimates and a benefit related to the deduction for qualified production activities

the increase in the fiscal year ended april  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was due primarily to the timing of liability payments and the million litigation settlement that was paid in fiscal these amounts were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  primarily as a result of the increase in sales 
cash and investments available for sale of  at april  decreased by  as compared with the  available as of april   primarily because of changes in working capital accounts and higher capital expenditures 
cash equivalents consist of money market accounts and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less 
investments available for sale consist of investment contracts with high rated  stable insurance companies  marketable securities consisting of corporate and municipal bonds  us government agency securities and mutual funds carried at fair value 
the company s investment objectives in order of importance are the preservation of principal  maintenance of liquidity and rate of return 
the fixed income portfolio consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk  and they generally mature within years 
the company invests in mutual funds with characteristics similar to the fixed income portfolio to enhance its investment portfolio diversification 
the company monitors the maturities of its investments to ensure that funding is available for anticipated cash needs 
at april    of available for sale investments were classified as non current assets as they were determined to be temporarily impaired and have maturity dates of one year or longer 
these investments were not determined to be other than temporarily impaired as the company has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow a recovery of fair value 
expected future cash flows from operations  cash equivalents and investments included within current assets are expected to fund the company s short term working capital needs 
as of april   the company had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of  a mutual fund of  and  classified as cash and cash equivalents and variable rate securities 
the fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
however  while the value of the investment may fluctuate in any given period  the company intends to hold its fixed income investments until maturity 
consequently  the company would not expect to recognize an adverse impact on net income or cash flows or the amount ultimately realized on the investment 
the value of the mutual fund  like all mutual funds  may increase or decrease due to market volatility 
the company recorded a loss of  in the fiscal year ended april  due to declines in market value that were deemed other than temporary 
the mutual fund held by the company as of april  is a short term bond fund that invests primarily in investment grade securities 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended april   april  and march  were   and  respectively 
significant capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended april  consisted of approximately  for warehouse expansions including new equipment associated with the additional space  approximately  for software and hardware data processing equipment associated with the company s implementation of an erp system and approximately  for transportation equipment consisting primarily of new route sales trucks and tractor trailer delivery trucks 
we anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal to be comparable with the three previous years and they will primarily relate to facilities improvement projects and new route sales trucks 
dividends we increased our semi annual cash dividend by during the second quarter of fiscal to per share from per share 
the company first started paying cash dividends in and has done so each year since that time 
future dividend levels will be dependent upon hawkins results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period contractual obligation more than years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the company is committed to pay suppliers under the terms of open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
the company does not purchase  or commit to purchase  quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within one year 
outlook expected future cash flows from operations  coupled with the company s strong financial position  put the company in a position to fund both short and long term working capital and capital investment needs with internally generated funds 
management does not  therefore  anticipate the need to engage in significant financing activities in either the short or long term 
if the need to obtain additional capital does arise  management is confident that the company s total debt to capital ratio puts it in a position to obtain debt financing on favorable terms  however there are no assurances that this will occur 
although management continually reviews opportunities to enhance the value of the company through strategic acquisitions  other capital investments and strategic divestitures  no material commitments for such investments or divestitures currently exist 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company considers the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title passes to our customers  which occurs primarily when product has been shipped  if there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the products  performance has occurred  the price and terms of sale are fixed  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
investments statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

and fas no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the general market conditions  including factors such as industry and sector performance  rating agency actions  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from customers located in the united states 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the age of the outstanding receivables and the payment history and credit worthiness of each customer 
management evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses the inventory quantities on hand to estimated future usage and sales and  if necessary  writes down the value of inventory deemed obsolete or excess to market 
though management considers these reserves adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve 
lifo reserve inventories are primarily valued with cost being determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
we may incur significant fluctuations in our gross margins due primarily to changes in the cost of a single  large volume component of inventory 
the price of this inventory component may vary depending on the balance between supply and demand 
management reviews the lifo reserve on a quarterly basis 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization and property  plant  and equipment  when events and changes in circumstances warrant such a review  such as prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
self insurance the company purchases insurance for employee medical benefits with high deductibles 
third party insurance is carried for what is believed to be the major portion of potential exposures that would exceed the company s self insured retentions 
the company has established a liability for potential uninsured claims 
the company considers factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  and other relevant factors in setting the liability 
these reserves are monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
though management considers these balances adequate  a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims would result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal and state tax issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits
