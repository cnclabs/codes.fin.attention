the company believes that while its wireless subscriber base continues to grow  the recent economic downturn  resulting in reduced spending by wireless telecommunications service providers  has caused many wireless telecommunications equipment manufacturers to delay or forego purchases of the company s products 
the company expects that its defense and satellite customers should continue to maintain their approximate current levels of orders during fiscal year  though there are no assurances they will do so 
nevertheless  in times of armed conflict or war  military spending is concentrated on armaments build up  maintenance and troop support  and not on the research and development and specialty applications that are the company s core strengths and revenue generators 
accordingly  our defense and military product revenues may decrease and should not be expected to increase  at times of armed conflicts or war 
the company also anticipates increased levels of orders during fiscal year for its multi mix microtechnology products  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from new and existing customers and market research 
the improved telecommunications sector and the continued efforts to diversify fmi into wireless basestations  automotive and defense applications has resulted in additional orders for fmi  which the company anticipates will continue 
cost of sales for the company consists of materials  salaries and related expenses  and outside services for manufacturing and certain engineering personnel and manufacturing overhead 
our products are designed and manufactured in the company s facilities 
the company s manufacturing and production facilities infrastructure overhead are relatively fixed and are based on its expectations of future net revenues 
should the company experience a reduction in net revenues in a quarter  it could have difficulty adjusting short term expenditures and absorbing any excess capacity expenses 
if this were to occur  the company s operating results for that quarter would be negatively impacted 
in order to remain competitive  the company must continually reduce its manufacturing costs through design and engineering innovations and increases in manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce its manufacturing costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses exceeded capital expenditures for new projects and production equipment during by approximately  and the company anticipates that depreciation and amortization expenses will exceed capital expenditures in fiscal year by approximately  the company intends to issue up to  of purchase order commitments for capital equipment from various vendors 
the company anticipates that such equipment will be purchased and become operational during fiscal year the company s planned equipment purchases and other commitments are expected to be funded through cash resources and cash flows expected to be generated from operations  and supplemented by the company s  revolving credit facility  which expires october  the company anticipates the revolving credit facility will be renewed 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs for administrative  selling and marketing groups  sales commissions to employees and manufacturing representatives  travel  product marketing and promotion costs  as well as legal  accounting  information technology and other administrative costs 
the company expects to continue to make significant and increasing expenditures for selling  general and administrative expenses  especially in connection with implementation of its strategic plan for generating and expanding sales of multi mix products 
research and development expenses consist of materials  salaries and related expenses of certain engineering personnel  and outside services related to product development projects 
the company charges all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the company believes that continued investment in research and development is critical to the company s long term business success 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods  and expect that these costs will increase over time  in order to develop new products  enhance performance of existing products and reduce the cost of current or new products 
critical accounting estimates and policies the company s management makes certain assumptions and estimates that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  and revenues and expenses 
these assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain 
the management judgments that are currently the most critical are related to the accounting for the company s investments in multi mix microtechnology  contract revenue recognition  inventory valuation  valuation of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
below is a further description of these policies as well as the estimates involved 
impairment of long lived assets the following is a summary of the carrying amounts of the multi mix microtechnology net assets included in the company s consolidated financial statements at december  and the related future planned purchases and lease obligation commitments through january net assets

approximately of the property  plant and equipment may be utilized in other areas of our electronic components and subsystems operations 
the company anticipates receiving additional orders during for its multi mix microtechnology products  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from new and existing customers and market research  for which substantial research and development costs have also been incurred 
due to economic and market conditions in the wireless industry since  wireless telecommunications system service providers substantially reduced their capital equipment purchases from our customers 
while these circumstances have resulted in the delay or cancellation of multi mix microtechnology product purchases that had been anticipated from certain specific customers or programs  in connection with the improved conditions in the industry  the company has implemented a strategic plan utilizing product knowledge and customer focus to expand specific sales opportunities 
however  continued extended delay or reduction from planned levels in new orders expected from customers for these products could require the company to pursue alternatives related to the utilization or realization of these assets and commitments 
should these alternatives not be realized  the company would have to write down the value of these assets  thereby incurring an impairment charge to earnings  the net result of which would be materially adverse to the financial results and condition of the company 
in accordance with the company s evaluation of multi mix under sfas no 
 the company has determined no provision for impairment is required at this time 
management will continue to monitor the recoverability of the multi mix assets 
contract revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
contract revenue and related costs on fixed price and cost reimbursement contracts that require customization of products to customer specifications are recorded when title transfers to the customer  which is generally on the date of shipment 
prior to shipment  manufacturing costs incurred on such contracts are recorded as work in process inventory 
anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations when identified 
revenue related to non recurring engineering charges is generally recognized upon shipment of the related initial units produced or based upon contractually established stages of completion 
the cost rates utilized for cost reimbursement contracts are subject to review by third parties and can be revised  which can result in additions to or reductions from revenue 
revisions which result in reductions to revenue are recognized in the period that the rates are reviewed and finalized  additions to revenue are recognized in the period that the rates are reviewed  finalized  accepted by the customer  and collectability from the customer is assured 
the company submits financial information regarding the cost rates on cost reimbursement contracts for each fiscal year in which the company performed work on cost reimbursement contracts 
the company does not record any estimates on a regular basis for potential revenue adjustments  as there currently is no reasonable basis on which to estimate such adjustments given the company s very limited experience with these contracts 
during  the company recognized revenue of  related to a cost reimbursement contract 
during  the company recognized a revenue reduction of  related to a cost reimbursement contract 
the company recognized revenue of  related to cost reimbursement contracts in inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inventories are periodically reviewed for their projected manufacturing usage utilization and  when slow moving or obsolete inventories are identified  a provision for a potential loss is made and charged to operations 
total inventories are net of valuation allowances for obsolescence and cost overruns of  at december  and  at january   of which  and  respectively  represented cost overruns 
procurement of inventory is based on specific customer orders and forecasts 
customers have certain rights of modification with respect to these orders and forecasts 
as a result  customer modifications to orders and forecasts affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory for the related customers 
although we may be able to use some of these excess components and raw materials in other products we manufacture  a portion of the cost of this excess inventory may not be recoverable from customers  nor may any excess quantities be returned to the vendors 
we also may not be able to recover the cost of obsolete inventory from vendors or customers 
write offs or write downs of inventory generally arise from

our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand and that we are not able to return to the vendor or charge back to the customer valuation of goodwill with the adoption of sfas no 
by the company on december   goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
however  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
the company performed the annual assessment during the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company currently has significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which should reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company s and net losses weighed heavily in the company s overall assessment 
as a result of the assessment  the company established a full valuation allowance for its remaining net domestic deferred tax assets at december  this assessment continued unchanged in  and in the company added a valuation allowance for certain canadian deferred tax assets of  because it believed that the probability of realization of such assets was uncertain 
management believes that a valuation allowance is not required for the remainder of fmi s recorded deferred tax assets as they are more likely than not to be realized

compared to net sales 
consolidated results of operations for reflect a decrease in net sales from of  or to  this decrease was attributable to a  decrease in net sales of electronic components and subsystems offset in part by a  increase in sales of microwave micro circuitry products from the company s wholly owned subsidiary fmi 
the decrease in net sales for the electronic components and subsystems segment for is due to reduced orders from delays in space and defense programs 
the company expects that its orders from its defense and satellite customers to improve during fiscal year  though there are no assurances they will do so 
in times of armed conflict or war  military spending is concentrated on armaments build up  maintenance and troop support  and not on the research and development and specialty applications that are the company s core strengths and revenue generators 
the company also anticipates increased levels of orders during fiscal year for its multi mix microtechnology products  based on inquiries from existing customers  requests to quote from new and existing customers and market research 
the increase in sales of the microwave micro circuitry segment for was due to new orders from both existing and new customers due to the continued efforts to diversify fmi into wireless basestations  automotive and defense applications 
fmi anticipates much of this new order volume to renew in future periods 
backlog represents the amount of orders the company has received that have not been shipped as of the end of a particular fiscal period 
the orders in backlog are a measure of future sales and determine the company s upcoming material  labor and service requirements 
the book to bill ratio for a particular period represents orders received for that period divided by net sales for the same period 
the company looks for this ratio to exceed  indicating the backlog is being replenished at a higher rate than the sales being removed from the backlog

the decrease in gross profit for for the electronic components and subsystems segment was due to the overall decrease in segment sales 
cost of sales for the electronic components and subsystems segment also reflects a reduction of intersegment purchases from fmi of  for depreciation expense included in consolidated cost of sales was  a decrease of  compared to for  approximately  of depreciation expense was associated with multi mix microtechnology capital assets 
fmi sales include intersegment sales of  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percent for is due to higher material and overhead costs  including additional overtime  related to the new defense orders booked in during the second half of  gross profit margin at fmi was negatively impacted by the weakness of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
the higher material and overtime costs for such defense orders are not expected to continue into future periods  but certain additional overhead costs may affect future results 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses of  for decreased by  or  and when expressed as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points to compared to the selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower commissions related to the lower sales level in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for new products were  for  an increase of  or and when expressed as a percentage of net sales  an increase of percentage points to compared to except for  of expenses at fmi a decrease of  from such fmi expenses in substantially all of the research and development expenses were related to multi mix microtechnology  multi mix pico and power amplifier products 
the company anticipates that these expenses will increase in future periods in connection with further implementation of our strategic plan for multi mix 
operating income

interest and other expense  net was  for compared to interest and other expense  net of  for interest expense for and was principally incurred on borrowings under the revolving line of credit and term loans which the company consummated during the fourth quarter of the reduction of interest and other expense was due to lower outstanding debt balances during as the company repaid  throughout income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended december  and january  reflects us federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes for the respective years 
the current benefit reflects a  domestic tax benefit related to tax planning on the returns 
the current foreign tax benefit for the year ended december  represents refundable canadian provincial tax credits for which fmi  as a technology company  has qualified 
the current tax provision in the amount of  was based on certain statutory limitations on the use of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
tax benefits were recorded in the amount of  in primarily associated with fmi s research and development expenses incurred in canada 
internal revenue service code section places a limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards when an ownership change  as defined in the tax law  occurs 
generally  an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than percent change in ownership 
if such change should occur  the actual utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  for tax purposes  would be limited annually to a percentage of the fair market value of the company at the time of such change 
the company may become subject to these limitations in depending on change in ownership

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest on the company s borrowings under its financing agreement with cit fluctuates with the prime rate and libor 
a variation of in the prime rate and libor during the year ended december  would have affected the company s earnings by approximately  foreign currency risk the company is subject to currency exchange rate risk for the assets  liabilities and cash flows of its subsidiary that operates in canada 
the company does not utilize financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts or other derivatives to limit its exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
there are costs associated with our operations in canada which require payments in the local currency and payments received from customers for goods sold in canada are typically in the local currency 
we partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments by maintaining operating accounts in canada 
a significant portion of the company s revenues and receivables including those of its canadian subsidiary are denominated in us dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make the company s products less competitive in foreign markets 
alternatively  if the us dollar were to weaken  it would make the company s products more competitive in foreign markets  but could result in higher costs from its canadian operations
