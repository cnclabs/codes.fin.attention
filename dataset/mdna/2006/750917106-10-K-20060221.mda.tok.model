table of contents item a 
risk factors we face current and potential adverse determinations in litigation stemming from our efforts to protect and enforce our patents and intellectual property  which could broadly impact our intellectual property rights  distract our management and cause a substantial decline in our revenues and stock price 
we seek to diligently protect our intellectual property rights 
in connection with the extension of our licensing program to sdram compatible and ddr compatible products in  we became involved in litigation related to such efforts 
as of february   we are in litigation with four such potential sdram compatible and ddr compatible licensees 
in each of these cases  we have claimed infringement of our patents while the potential licensees have generally sought damages and a determination that our patents at suit are invalid and not infringed 
these potential licensees have also relied or may rely upon defenses and counterclaims some not yet formally asserted that our patents are unenforceable based on various allegations concerning our alleged conduct in the s and early s  including that we engaged in document spoliation  litigation misconduct and or acted improperly during our participation in the jedec standard setting organization 
for example  hynix has now broadened its counterclaims to attempt to include our s relationship with intel and our alleged disparagement of ddr and sdram products in the s and early s 
by way of further example  micron  hynix  samsung and nanya have alleged that we have unclean hands based on alleged litigation misconduct and document spoliation  allegations that overlap with those successfully used by infineon to obtain the early dismissal of our patent claims in the our case against infineon in virginia 
although we recently defeated hynix s similar unclean hands and spoliation claims  hynix has sought a new trial on these issues or permission to appeal the court s decision 
there can be no assurance that such claims will not again be successfully used to defeat or limit our patent or other claims 
there can be no assurance that parties will not succeed with such claims or counterclaims against us or that they will not in some other way establish broad defenses against our patents  achieve conflicting results  or otherwise avoid or delay paying what we believe to be appropriate royalties for the use of our patents or that the pending litigations and other circumstances will not reach a point where we elect to compromise for less than what we now believe to be fair consideration 
among other things  there can be no assurance that we will succeed in negotiating future settlements or licenses on terms better than those recently extended in our infineon settlement 
there can be no assurances that the circumstances under which we negotiated our infineon settlement will turn out to be significantly different from the circumstances of future cases and future settlements  although we currently believe that significant differences do exist 
any of these matters  whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly  may cause delays  will tend to discourage future design partners  will tend to impair adoption of our existing technologies and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from other business operations 
furthermore  any adverse determination or other resolution in litigation could result in our losing certain rights beyond the rights at issue in a particular case  including  among other things our being effectively barred from suing others for violating certain or all of our intellectual property rights  our patents being held invalid or unenforceable  our being subjected to significant liabilities  our being required to seek licenses from third parties  our being prevented from licensing our patented technology  or our being required to renegotiate with current licensees on a temporary or permanent basis 
delay or any or all of these adverse results could cause a substantial decline in our revenues and stock price 
an acquisition of all of infineon s dram operations could make it more difficult for us to obtain royalty rates we believe are appropriate and could reduce the number of companies in our antitrust litigation our license with infineon  which was part of our settlement  provides for the extension of certain benefits under that license to a successor in interest that  under certain conditions  acquires all of infineon s dram operations 
if such an acquisition were to occur  such successor would be entitled to the extension of such 
table of contents benefits  including the ability to pay a royalty calculated by multiplying the infineon rate by the percentage increase in dram volume represented by the successor company s combined operations 
such an extension of benefits could also make it more difficult for us to obtain the royalty rates we believe are appropriate from the market as a whole 
such an extension of benefits would  in addition  also operate to extend a release of claims to such successor  thus reducing the number of companies to which we believe we are entitled to look for compensation for the antitrust injury alleged by us in our pending san francisco antitrust action 
an adverse resolution by or with a governmental agency  such as the federal trade commission or the european commission  could result in severe limitations on our ability to protect and license our intellectual property  and would cause our revenues to decline substantially 
if there were an adverse determination by  or other resolution with  a government agency  it may limit our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights or to obtain licenses  which would cause our revenues to decline substantially 
for example  in june  the ftc filed a complaint against us alleging  among other things  that we had failed to disclose certain patents and patent applications during our participation in the establishment of sdram standards with jedec and that we should be precluded from enforcing our intellectual property rights in patents with a priority date prior to june although the initial decision in the ftc proceeding supported our position and dismissed the complaint  that initial decision has been appealed by the ftc staff and may be reversed by the ftc or subject to some future compromise given developments in that case or the totality of circumstances we face 
among other things  the ftc has recently permitted a partial re opening of the record 
the european commission has directed inquiries to us relating to similar topics 
if proceedings by one of these agencies  or any other governmental agency  result in a resolution that could limit our ability to enforce or license our intellectual property  our revenues could decline substantially 
on may   the technical appeals board of the european patent office issued its written opinion as to the revocation of european patent no 
in addition  on january   an opposition board of the european patent office revoked our european patent no 
 and issued its written decision on february  we are appealing this decision to an appellate panel of the european patent office 
while this result still leaves us with additional issued patents in europe relating to one or both of sdram and ddr sdram memory products  there are similar pending opposition proceedings with respect to some of those patents as well 
if a sufficient number of such patents are similarly impaired or revoked  our ability to enforce or license our intellectual property would be significantly impaired and this could cause our revenues to decline substantially 
if we are unable to successfully protect our inventions through the issuance and enforcement of patents  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we have an active program to protect our proprietary inventions through the filing of patents 
there can be no assurance  however  that any current or future us or foreign patent applications will be approved  our issued patents will protect our intellectual property and not be challenged by third parties  the validity of our patents will be upheld  our patents will not be declared unenforceable  the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  the congress or the us courts or foreign countries will not change the nature or scope of rights afforded patents or patent owners or alter in an adverse way the process for seeking patents  or others will not independently develop similar or competing chip interfaces or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
if any of the above were to occur  our operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents our inability to protect and own the intellectual property created by us would cause our business to suffer 
we rely primarily on a combination of license  development and nondisclosure agreements  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  and contractual provisions to protect our other  non patentable intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect these intellectual property rights  our licensees and others may seek to use our technology without the payment of license fees and royalties  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation 
the growth of our business depends in large part on the applicability of our intellectual property to the products of third party manufacturers  and our ability to enforce intellectual property rights against them 
in addition  effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  if we fail to do so  our business will suffer 
we might experience payment disputes for amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements  and this may harm our results of operations 
many of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterly basis 
while licenses with such terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information  audits can be expensive  time consuming  and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees 
we have implemented a royalty audit program  which consists of periodic royalty audits of our major licensees  using accounting firms that are independent of our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp 
we have performed royalty audits from time to time but we primarily rely on the accuracy of the reports from licensees without independently verifying the information in them 
our failure to audit our licensees books and records may result in us receiving more or less royalty revenues than we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements 
the result of such royalty audits could result in an increase  as a result of a licensee s underpayment  or decrease  as a result of a licensee s overpayment  to previously reported royalty revenues 
such adjustments are recorded in the period they are determined 
any adverse material adjustments resulting from royalty audits or dispute resolutions may result in us missing analyst estimates and causing our stock price to decline 
royalty audits may also trigger disagreements over contract terms with our licensees and such disagreements could hamper customer relations  divert the efforts and attention of our management from normal operations and impact our business operations and financial condition 
if market leaders do not adopt our chip interface products  our results of operation could decline 
an important part of our strategy is to penetrate markets for chip interfaces by working with leaders in those markets 
this strategy is designed to encourage other participants in those markets to follow such leaders in adopting our chip interfaces 
if a high profile industry participant adopts our chip interfaces but fails to achieve success with its products or adopts and achieves success with a competing chip interface  our reputation and sales could be adversely affected 
in addition  some industry participants have adopted  and others may in the future adopt  a strategy of disparaging our memory solutions adopted by their competitors or a strategy of otherwise undermining the market adoption of our solutions 
by way of example  we target system companies to adopt our chip interface technologies  particularly those that develop and market high volume business and consumer products such as pcs and video game consoles 
we are subject to many risks beyond our control that influence whether or not a particular system company will adopt our chip interfaces  including  among others competition faced by a system company in its particular industry  the timely introduction and market acceptance of a system company s products  the engineering  sales and marketing and management capabilities of a system company  technical challenges unrelated to our chip interfaces faced by a system company in developing its products  
table of contents the financial and other resources of the system company  the supply of semiconductors from our licensees in sufficient quantities and at commercially attractive prices  the ability to establish the prices at which the chips containing our chip interfaces are made available to system companies  and the degree to which our licensees promote our chip interfaces to a system company 
our strategy also includes gaining acceptance of our technology in high volume consumer applications  including video game consoles  such as the sony playstation  digital tvs and set top boxes 
there can be no assurance that consumer products that currently use our technology will continue to do so  nor can there be any assurance that the consumer products that incorporate our technology will be successful in generating expected royalties  nor can there be any assurance that any of our technologies selected for licensing will be implemented in a commercially developed or distributed product 
if any of these events occur and market leaders do not successfully adopt our technologies  our strategy may not be successful and  as a result  our results of operations could decline 
our revenue is concentrated in a few customers  and if we lose any of these customers  our revenues may decrease substantially 
for the twelve months ended december   and  revenues from our top five licensees accounted for approximately  and of our revenues  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues from intel  elpida  toshiba and matsushita each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues from intel  toshiba and elpida each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues from intel  toshiba and samsung each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
we recently entered into agreements with infineon and amd  which are expected to account for a significant percentage of our revenues in we may continue to experience significant revenue concentration for the foreseeable future 
substantially all of our licensees  including intel  have the right to cancel their licenses 
failure to renew licenses and or the loss of any of our top five licensees would cause revenues to decline substantially 
intel is our largest customer and is an important catalyst for the development of new memory and logic chip interfaces in the semiconductor industry 
we have a patent cross license agreement with intel for which we will receive quarterly royalty payments through the second quarter of the patent cross license agreement expires in september  at which time  intel will have a paid up license for the use of all of our patents claiming priority prior to september intel has the right to cancel the agreement with us prior to the expiration of the contract 
we have other licenses with intel  in addition to the patent cross license agreement  for the development of serial link chip interfaces 
if we do not replace the revenues we previously received under the intel contract  our results of operations may decline significantly 
in addition  some of our commercial agreements require us to provide certain customers with the lowest royalty rate that we provide to other customers for similar technologies  volumes and schedules 
these clauses may limit our ability to effectively price differently among our customers  to respond quickly to market forces  or otherwise to compete on the basis of price 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we anticipate that revenue will continue to be concentrated in a limited number of licensees 

table of contents we are in negotiations with licensees to renew sdram and ddr compatible contracts 
two licensees are on interim agreements which will expire this year and one licensee is on an extension which expires this year 
we are also in negotiations with new potential licensees 
we expect sdram and ddr compatible royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
if we are unsuccessful in renewing any of our sdram and ddr compatible contracts  our results of operations may decline significantly 
some of our revenue is subject to the pricing policies of our licensees over whom we have no control 
we have no control over our licensees pricing of their products and there can be no assurance that licensee products using or containing our chip interfaces will be competitively priced or will sell in significant volumes 
one important requirement for our memory chip interfaces is for any premium in the price of memory and controller chips over alternatives to be reasonable in comparison to the perceived benefits of the chip interfaces 
if the benefits of our technology do not match the price premium charged by our licensees  the resulting decline in sales of products incorporating our technology could harm our operating results 
we face intense competition that may cause our results of operations to suffer 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been impacted by price erosion  rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns and increasing foreign and domestic competition 
some semiconductor companies have developed and support competing logic chip interfaces including their own serial link chip interfaces and parallel bus chip interfaces 
we also face competition from semiconductor and intellectual property companies who provide their own ddr memory chip interface technology and solutions 
in addition  most dram manufacturers  including our rdram and xdr licensees  produce versions of dram such as sdram  ddrx where the x is a number that represents a version and gddrx where the x is a number that represents a version which compete with rdram and xdr chips 
we believe that our principal competition for memory chip interfaces may come from our licensees and prospective licensees  some of which are evaluating and developing products based on technologies that they contend or may contend will not require a license from us 
in addition  our competitors are also taking a system approach similar to ours in seeking to solve the application needs of system companies 
many of these companies are larger and may have better access to financial  technical and other resources than we possess 
jedec has standardized what they call an extension of ddr  known as ddr jedec is also standardizing what they describe as an extension of ddr that they refer to as ddr and a fb dimm standard 
other efforts are underway to create other products including those sometimes referred to as gddr and gddr  as well as new ways to integrate products such as system in package dram 
to the extent that these alternatives might provide comparable system performance at lower or similar cost than rdram and xdr memory chips  or are perceived to require the payment of no or lower royalties  or to the extent other factors influence the industry  our licensees and prospective licensees may adopt and promote alternative technologies 
even to the extent we determine that such alternative technologies infringe our patents  there can be no assurance that we would be able to negotiate agreements that would result in royalties being paid to us without litigation  which could be costly and the results of which would be uncertain 
in the industry standard and proprietary serial link chip interface business  we face additional competition from semiconductor companies that sell discrete transceiver chips for use in various types of systems  from semiconductor companies that develop their own serial link chip interfaces  as well as from competitors  such as arm and synopsys  who license similar serial link chip interface products and digital controllers 
at the gb s speed  competition will also come from optical technology sold by system and semiconductor companies 
there are standardization efforts under way or completed for serial links from standard bodies such as pci sig and oif 
we may face increased competition from these types of consortia in the future that could negatively impact our serial link chip interface business 

table of contents in the flexio processor bus chip interface business  we face additional competition from semiconductor companies who develop their own parallel bus chip interfaces  as well as competitors who license similar parallel bus chip interface products 
we may also see competition from industry consortia or standard setting bodies that could negatively impact our flexio processor bus chip interface business 
as with our memory chip interface products  to the extent that competitive alternatives to our serial or parallel logic chip interface products might provide comparable system performance at lower or similar cost  or are perceived to require the payment of no or lower royalties  or to the extent other factors influence the industry  our licensees and prospective licensees may adopt and promote alternative technologies  which could negatively impact our memory and logic chip interface business 
if for any of these reasons we cannot effectively compete in these primary market areas  our results of operations could suffer 
future revenues are difficult to predict for several reasons  including our lengthy and costly licensing cycle  and our failure to predict revenues accurately may cause us to miss analysts estimates and result in our stock price declining 
because our licensing cycle is a lengthy process  the accurate prediction of future revenues from new licenses is difficult 
by way of example  the process of persuading system companies to adopt our chip interface technologies can be lengthy and  even if adopted  there can be no assurance that our chip interfaces will be used in a product that is ultimately brought to market  achieves commercial acceptance or results in significant royalties to us 
in addition  engineering services are dependent upon the varying level of assistance desired by licensees and  therefore  revenue from these services is also difficult to predict 
we employ two methods of contract revenue accounting based upon the state of the technology licensed  the dollar magnitude of the program and the ability to estimate work required over the contract period 
we use ratable revenue recognition for mature technologies that require insignificant support after delivery of the technology 
this method results in expenses associated with a particular contract to be recognized as incurred over the contract period  whereas contract fees associated with the contract are recognized ratably over the period during which the post contract customer support is expected to be provided 
we also use percentage of completion accounting for contracts that may require significant development and support over the contract term 
there can be no assurance that we can accurately estimate the amount of resources required to complete projects  or that we will have  or be able to expend  sufficient resources required to complete a project 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the product development schedule for these projects will not be changed or delayed 
all of these factors make it difficult to predict future licensing revenue and may result in us missing analysts estimates which would likely cause our stock price to decline 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for holders to resell their shares when desired or at attractive prices 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol rmbs 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations which may continue in the future in response to  among other things  the following any progress  or lack of progress  real or perceived  in the development of products that incorporate our chip interfaces  our signing or not signing new licensees  new litigation or developments in current litigation including adverse litigation results such as an adverse outcome to us in the hynix proceedings  announcements of our technological innovations or new products by us  our licensees or our competitors  
table of contents positive or negative reports by securities analysts as to our expected financial results  and developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights and other events or factors 
in addition  the equity markets have experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  which may make it difficult for holders to resell their shares when desired or at attractive prices 
our quarterly and annual operating results are unpredictable and fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to be volatile and decline 
since many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our expenses are largely independent of revenues in any particular period  it is difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues and profitability 
factors other than those set forth above that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include semiconductor and system companies acceptance of our chip interface products  the loss of any strategic relationships with system companies or licensees  semiconductor or system companies discontinuing major products incorporating our chip interfaces  the unpredictability of the timing of any litigation expenses  changes in our chip and system company customers development schedules and levels of expenditure on research and development  our licensees terminating or failing to make payments under their current contracts or seeking to modify such contracts  and changes in our strategies  including changes in our licensing focus and or possible acquisitions of companies with business models different from our own 
in the twelve months ended december   and royalties accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively  and we believe that royalties will continue to represent a majority of total revenues for the foreseeable future 
royalties are recognized in the quarter in which we receive a report from a licensee regarding the sale of licensed chips in the prior quarter  however  royalties are only recognized if collectibility is reasonably assured 
some royalties are also dependent upon fluctuating sales volumes and prices of licensed chips that include our technology  all of which are beyond our ability to control or assess in advance 
in addition  royalty revenues are affected by the seasonal shipment patterns of systems incorporating our chip interface products  or by a system company change in its source of licensed chips  and the new source s different royalty rates 
as a result of these uncertainties and effects being outside of our control  royalty revenues are difficult to predict and make accurate financial forecasts difficult to achieve  which could cause our stock price to become volatile and decline 
fasb s adoption of statement r will cause  and changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may cause  adverse revenue fluctuations  affect our reported results of operations or how we conduct our business 
in december  fasb issued statement r  share based payment 
on april   the sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amended the compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
under this new rule  companies are allowed to implement sfas no 
r starting in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas no 
r will require us to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  as currently constructed at fair value and take a compensation charge equal to that value 
also  a change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
other new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of 
table of contents accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
this change to existing rules  future changes  if any  or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
if we cannot respond to rapid technological change in the semiconductor industry by developing new innovations in a timely and cost effective manner  our operating results will suffer 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  with new generations of semiconductors being introduced periodically and with ongoing improvements 
we derive most of our revenue from our chip interface technologies that we have patented 
we expect that this dependence on our fundamental technology will continue for the foreseeable future 
the introduction or market acceptance of competing chip interfaces that render our chip interfaces less desirable or obsolete would have a rapid and material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the announcement of new chip interfaces by us could cause licensees or system companies to delay or defer entering into arrangements for the use of our current chip interfaces  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial results and condition of operations 
we are dependent on the industry to develop test solutions that are adequate to test our chip interfaces and to supply such test solutions to our customers and us 
our continued success depends on our ability to introduce and patent enhancements and new generations of our chip interface technologies that keep pace with other changes in the semiconductor industry and which achieve rapid market acceptance 
we must continually devote significant engineering resources to addressing the ever increasing need for higher speed chip interfaces associated with increases in the speed of microprocessors and other controllers 
the technical innovations that are required for us to be successful are inherently complex and require long development cycles  and there can be no assurance that our development efforts will ultimately be successful 
in addition  these innovations must be completed before changes in the semiconductor industry render them obsolete  available when system companies require these innovations  and sufficiently compelling to cause semiconductor manufacturers to enter into licensing arrangements with us for these new technologies 
finally  significant technological innovations generally require a substantial investment before their commercial viability can be determined 
by way of example  our xdr and flexio chip interfaces and the manufacturing processes to incorporate them are new and complex  which may lead to technology and product development scheduling risks and there remains significant contract work to be completed  therefore percentage of completion accounting is used for these licenses 
there can be no assurance that we have accurately estimated the amount of resources required to complete the projects  or that we will have  or be able to expend  sufficient resources required for these types of projects 
in addition  there is market risk associated with these products  and there can be no assurance that unit volumes  and their associated royalties  will occur 
if our technology fails to capture or maintain a portion of the high volume consumer market  our business results could suffer 
if we cannot successfully respond to rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry by developing new products in a timely and cost effective manner our operating results will suffer 
any dispute regarding our intellectual property may require us to indemnify certain licensees  the cost of which could severely hamper our business operations and financial condition 
in any potential dispute involving our patents or other intellectual property  our licensees could also become the target of litigation 
while we generally do not indemnify our licensees  some of our license agreements provide limited indemnities  some require us to provide technical support and information to a licensee that is involved in litigation involving use of our technology  and we may agree to indemnify others in the future 
our support and indemnification obligations could result in substantial expenses 
in addition to the time and expense 
table of contents required for us to supply such support or indemnification to our licensees  a licensee s development  marketing and sales of licensed semiconductors could be severely disrupted or shut down as a result of litigation  which in turn could severely hamper our business operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to satisfy the requirements under the infineon settlement and license agreement that would require infineon to pay us up to an additional million in royalty payments 
on march   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with infineon and its former parent siemens which  among other things  requires infineon to pay to us aggregate royalties of million in quarterly installments of million  which started on november  the settlement and license agreement further provides that if we enter into licenses with certain other dram manufacturers  infineon will be required to make additional royalty payments to us which may aggregate up to million 
we may not succeed in entering into these additional license agreements necessary to trigger infineon s obligations under the settlement and license agreement to pay to us additional royalty payments  thereby reducing the value of the settlement and license agreement to us 
we are leveraged financially  which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs  and to defend our intellectual property 
we have indebtedness 
on february   we issued million aggregate principal amount of zero coupon senior convertible notes due february   of which million remains outstanding as of february  the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes may be limited  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of the principal of our indebtedness as we are required to pay the principal amount of the convertible notes in cash when due  if we elect to pay any premium on the convertible notes with shares of our common stock or we are required to pay a make whole premium with our shares of common stock  our existing stockholders interest in us would be diluted  and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions 
a failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our debt instruments could result in events of default under such instruments  which could permit acceleration of the debt under such instruments and in some cases acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions 
if we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  however  we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness  seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms  that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
our business and operating results will be harmed if we are unable to manage growth in our business 
our business has experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
in order to manage this growth  we must continue to improve and expand our management  operational and financial systems and controls 
we also need to continue to expand  train and manage our employee base 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to 
table of contents timely and effectively meet demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers and licensees 
if we ineffectively manage our growth or are unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining personnel  our business and operating results will be harmed 
we may make future acquisitions or enter into mergers  strategic transactions or other arrangements that could cause our business to suffer 
we may continue to make investments in companies  products or technologies or enter into mergers  strategic transactions or other arrangements 
if we buy a company or a division of a company  we may experience difficulty integrating that company or division s personnel and operations  which could negatively affect our operating results 
in addition the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us  we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning  cash management and financial reporting  our ongoing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention  we may not be able to recognize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated  and our increasing international presence resulting from acquisitions may increase our exposure to foreign political  currency and tax risks 
in connection with future acquisitions or mergers  strategic transactions or other arrangements  we may incur substantial expenses regardless of whether the transaction occurs 
we may also incur non cash charges in connection with a merger  acquisition  strategic transaction or other arrangement 
in addition  we may be required to assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire 
by assuming the liabilities  we may incur liabilities such as those related to intellectual property infringement or indemnification of customers of acquired businesses for similar claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition  the issuance of which could involve restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sources outside of the united states and these revenues are subject to risks related to international operations that are often beyond our control 
for the twelve months ended december   and  revenues from our sales to international customers constituted approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we currently have international operations in india design  japan sales development  taiwan sales development and germany sales development 
as a result of our continued focus on international markets  we expect that future revenues derived from international sources will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
to date  all of the revenues from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties which are based as a percentage of the customers sales  that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
our international operations and revenues are subject to a variety of risks which are beyond our control  including export controls  tariffs  import and licensing restrictions and other trade barriers  profits  if any  earned abroad being subject to local tax laws and not being repatriated to the united states or  if repatriation is possible  limited in amount  
table of contents changes to tax codes and treatment of revenues from international sources  including being subject to foreign tax laws and potentially being liable for paying taxes in that foreign jurisdiction  foreign government regulations and changes in these regulations  social  political and economic instability  lack of protection of our intellectual property rights by jurisdictions in which we may do business to the same extent as the laws of the united states  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  cultural differences in the conduct of business both with licensees and in conducting business in our international facilities and international sales offices  operating centers outside the united states  such as our bangalore design center  and hiring  maintaining and managing a workforce remotely and under various legal systems 
we and our licensees are subject to many of the risks described above with respect to companies which are located in different countries  particularly home video game console and pc manufacturers located in asia and elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that one or more of the risks associated with our international operations could not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business and operations could suffer 
our success is dependent upon our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel who can enhance our existing technologies and introduce new technologies 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant industry experience  is intense 
we are also dependent upon our senior management personnel  many of whom have worked together for us for many years 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management personnel  or key sales personnel in critical markets  or critical members of staff  or of a significant number of our engineers could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships and could cause our business and operations to suffer 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and the nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
although we have complied with the certification and attestation requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act of for the year ended december   we may not be able to continue to meet such requirements annually and our failure to satisfy these requirements could adversely affect our financial results and the price of our common stock 
while we have evaluated our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  and complied with the management certification and our independent register public accounting firm attestation 
table of contents requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of in connection with this form k for the year ended december   we may not continue to meet such certification and attestation requirements annually 
if we are not able to continue to meet the requirements of section in a timely manner or with adequate compliance  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest to the evaluation  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq national market  which could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock 
our operations are subject to risks of natural disasters  acts of war  terrorism or widespread illness at our domestic and international locations  any one of which could result in a business stoppage and negatively affect our operating results 
our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facility  computer systems and personnel  which are primarily located in the san francisco bay area 
the san francisco bay area is in close proximity to known earthquake fault zones 
our facility and transportation for our employees are susceptible to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters such as fires  floods and similar events 
should an earthquake or other catastrophes  such as fires  floods  power loss  communication failure or similar events disable our facilities  we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business  which stoppage could have a negative effect on our operating results 
acts of terrorism  widespread illness and war could also have a negative effect at our international and domestic facilities 
our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws  our stockholder rights plan  and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage transactions resulting in a change in control  which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to discourage  delay or prevent change in control 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
among these provisions are our board of directors is authorized  without prior stockholder approval  to create and issue preferred stock  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of common stock  our board of directors is staggered into two classes  only one of which is elected at each annual meeting  stockholder action by written consent is prohibited  nominations for election to our board of directors and the submission of matters to be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting are subject to advance notice requirements  certain provisions in our bylaws and certificate of incorporation such as notice to stockholders  the ability to call a stockholder meeting  advanced notice requirements and the stockholders acting by written consent may only be amended with the approval of stockholders holding of our outstanding voting stock  the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders is prohibited  and our board of directors is expressly authorized to make  alter or repeal our bylaws 
in addition  the provisions in our stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to consummate an acquisition of our company 
we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which provides  subject to enumerated exceptions  that if a person acquires or more of our outstanding voting stock  the person is an interested stockholder and may not engage in any business combination with us for a period of three years from the time the person acquired or more of our outstanding voting stock

overview rambus invents and licenses chip interface technologies that are foundational to nearly all digital electronics products 
our chip interface technologies are designed to improve the time to market  performance  and cost effectiveness of our customers semiconductor and system products for computing  communications and consumer electronics applications 
our chip interface technologies are covered by more than us and international patents 
additionally  we have over patent applications currently pending 
these patents and patent applications cover important inventions in memory and logic chip interfaces  in addition to other technologies 
we believe that our chip interface technologies provide a higher performance  lower risk  and more cost effective alternative for our customers than can be achieved through their own internal research and development efforts 

table of contents we offer our customers two alternatives for using our chip interface technologies in their products first  we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and system companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
patent license agreements are royalty bearing 
second  we develop proprietary and industry standard chip interface products that we provide to our customers under license for incorporation into their semiconductor and system products 
because of the often complex nature of implementing state of the art chip interface technology  we offer our customers a range of engineering services to help them successfully integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems 
product license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
engineering services are customarily bundled with our product licenses  and are generally performed on a fixed price basis 
further  under product licenses  our customers may receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
we derive the majority of our annual revenues by licensing our broad portfolio of patents for chip interfaces to our customers 
such licenses may cover part or all of our patent portfolio 
leading semiconductor and system companies such as amd  elpida  infineon  intel  necel  and renesas have taken licenses to our patents for use in their own products 
we derive additional revenues by licensing our proprietary and industry standard chip interface products to our customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
due to the complex nature of implementing our technologies  we provide engineering services under certain of these licenses to help successfully integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems 
additionally  product licensees may receive  as an adjunct to their chip interface license agreements  patent licenses as necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
royalties represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
the remaining part of our revenue is engineering services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms  and can have a significant impact on deferred revenues in any given period 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five licensees representing  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   revenue from intel  elpida  toshiba and matsushita  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   revenue from intel  toshiba and elpida  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues from intel  toshiba and samsung  each accounted for greater than of total revenues 
our revenue from companies based outside of the united states accounted for  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that we will have significant revenues from companies based outside the united states for the foreseeable future and our revenue concentration will decrease over time as we license new customers 
for the last five years  we have been involved in significant litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict during this time and we anticipate future litigation expenses to continue to be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue would likely decline 

table of contents revenue concentration as indicated in the section titled overview  we have a high degree of revenue concentration 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses  and if we are unable to replace the revenue attributable to our agreement with intel  currently one of our top five licensees  which will end in june  our revenues could decline substantially 
the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we expect that our revenue concentration will decrease over time as we license new customers 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our chip interfaces by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our chip interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide detail as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenues will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenues that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our chip interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
international revenues we expect that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
to date  all of the revenues from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenues  see note titled business segments  exports and major customers of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change 
engineering 
engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues is determined based on the portion of engineering costs which have been incurred during the period of the adaptation of our chip interfaces for specific licensee processes 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for general development of our chip interfaces  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of development and implementation cycles 
engineering costs are recognized as incurred and do not correspond to the recognition of revenues under the related contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and 
table of contents administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and they can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to system companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period generally are unrelated to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
specifically  we report contract fees and royalties when received for tax purposes  as required by tax law 
for financial reporting purposes  however  we recognize revenues from xdr  flexio  and rdram contract fees  assuming collectibility  either ratably over the period post contract customer support is expected to be provided or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting  depending upon the nature of the contract 
we recognize revenues from sdram compatible and ddr compatible license fees  assuming collectibility  over the contract period and recognize royalty revenues upon notification from licensees 
thus  we recognize revenue earlier for tax than for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated condensed statements of operations twelve months ended december  revenues contract revenues royalties total revenues costs and expenses cost of contract revenues research and development marketing  general administrative litigation total costs and expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended december  to change to change total revenues in millions contract revenue royalties total revenues 
table of contents please refer to critical accounting policies  revenue recognition on page for a more detailed explanation of our revenue recognition policies on percentage of completion contracts  other contracts and royalties 
contract revenue percentage of completion contracts for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   percentage of completion contract revenue increased by approximately million due to new xdr and flexio chip interface contracts offset in part by the decrease in recognition of revenue associated with xdr  flexio and serial link chip interface contracts originating prior to for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   percentage of completion contract revenue increased by million due to the increase in recognition of revenue associated with our xdr  flexio  and serial link chip interface contracts 
the increase in recognition of revenue during was primarily a result of the increase in the amount of work performed under these contracts 
we believe that percentage of completion contract revenues recognized will continue to fluctuate over time based on our ongoing contractual requirements  cash received  the amount of work performed  and by changes to work required  as well as new contracts booked in the future 
most of our xdr and flexio contracts were complete as of the twelve months ending december  if new percentage of completion contracts are not signed and implemented our contract revenue may decline 
other contracts for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  revenue which is recognized over the estimated service periods increased by approximately million primarily due to the increase in recognition of revenue associated with ddr  serial link  xdr and flexio contracts 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  revenue which is recognized over the estimated service periods increased by approximately million primarily due to the increase in recognition of revenue associated with serial link interface contracts 
royalty revenues patent licenses in the twelve months ended december   and  our largest source of royalties was related to the license of our patents for sdram and ddr compatible products 
royalties increased by approximately million for sdram and ddr compatible products in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased shipment volumes of sdram and ddr controllers and the first quarterly royalty payment from infineon 
royalties increased by approximately million for sdram and ddr compatible products in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased shipment volumes of sdram and ddr controllers 
as of december   sdram and ddr compatible royalties were based on a percentage of the licensee s revenue with the exception of four contracts  for which fixed quarterly payments are made 
on december   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with amd 
we expect to recognize royalty revenues under the amd agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable as the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
the first amounts due and payable under the amd agreement begin in the first quarter of we expect to recognize royalty revenues of 
table of contents million in the year  million in the years through and million in the year under the amd agreement 
the amd agreement provides a license to our patents used in the design of ddr  ddr  fb dimm  pci express and xdr controllers as well as other current and future high speed memory and logic controller interfaces 
no revenue was recognized under the amd agreement in as of december   sdram and ddr compatible royalties were based on a percentage of the licensee s revenue with the exception of two contracts that allowed for fixed quarterly payments 
we are in negotiations with licensees to renew sdram and ddr compatible contracts 
two licensees are on interim agreements which will expire in april and october of and one licensee is on an extension which also expires in july of we are also in negotiations with new potential licensees 
we expect sdram and ddr compatible royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success in renewing existing license agreements and adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
we estimate that sdram and ddr compatible royalties will increase in as compared to the estimated increase is primarily a result of a full year s worth of royalties for infineon and amd 
the intel patent cross license agreement represented the second largest source of royalties in the twelve months ended december   and royalties under this agreement were unchanged in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same periods in and we expect to continue recognizing revenue from this agreement through june   at which time  intel will have a paid up license for the use of all of the patents that we own claiming priority prior to september  and for which we own applications as of that date 
if we are unable to replace the revenue attributable to our agreement with intel  currently one of our top five licensees  which will end in june  our revenues could decline substantially 
product licenses in the twelve months ended december   and  royalties from rdram compatible products represented the third largest source of royalties 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in by approximately million  royalties decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in as a result of lower shipment volumes of memory chips  and lower shipment volumes and lower average selling prices of memory controllers 
rdram is approaching end of life and in the future  we expect rdram royalties will continue to decline 
in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  royalties from rdram compatible products decreased by approximately million as a result of decreased shipments of rdram memory chips offset in part by an increase in royalties from rdram controllers 
we believe that the decrease in royalties for rdram memory chips for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was mostly driven by a decline in shipments of rdram memory chips for intel s e chipset 
royalties from xdr  flexio and serial link compatible products represent the fourth largest category of royalties 
royalties from xdr  flexio and serial link compatible products increased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in by approximately million 
this increase was primarily a result of minimum guaranteed royalties from a contract for serial link compatible products 
royalties from xdr  flexio and serial link compatible products increased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in by approximately million 
in the future  we expect xdr  flexio and serial link royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
we expect that xdr and flexio royalties will increase associated with the expected launch of the sony playstation product 

table of contents twelve months ended december  to change to change engineering costs in millions for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total engineering costs was a result of increased compensation costs approximately million associated with the hiring of approximately employees in the u 
s and in india  increased amortization of intangible asset costs approximately million associated with the purchase of digital core design assets from gda during the second quarter of and the purchase of serial link intellectual property from cadence during the third quarter of  increased consulting costs approximately million  and increased depreciation and amortization costs approximately million 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in total engineering costs was a result of the increase in compensation costs approximately million primarily due to the hiring of approximately additional employees in  amortization costs as part of our purchase of serial link intellectual property from velio during the quarter ended december  approximately million  amortization costs as part of our purchase of serial link intellectual property from cadence during the quarter ended september  approximately million and an increase in patent filing costs approximately million 
in the future  we expect that engineering costs will continue to increase associated with accounting for stock based compensation and continued investments in high performance chip interface technologies 
twelve months ended december  to change to change marketing  general and administrative costs in millions marketing  general and administrative costs litigation expense total marketing  general and administrative costs the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs including litigation expense for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to increased expenses associated with the defense of our intellectual property approximately million  increased compensation costs approximately million primarily due to the hiring of approximately employees and stock based compensation costs associated with the restricted stock grant to our ceo in the first quarter of  increased information technology costs approximately million primarily due to increased investment in business applications and infrastructure  and increased professional services costs approximately million 
the increase in total marketing  general and administrative costs including litigation expense for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to increased expenses  associated with the defense of our intellectual property approximately million  increased investments in sales and marketing approximately million which included marketing events  compensation costs and public relations  increased corporate governance costs approximately million and increased legal personnel expenses approximately million which included recruiting and compensation costs 
in the future  we expect that marketing  general and administrative expenses will vary from period to period based on the legal  trade shows  advertising  and other marketing and administrative activities undertaken  accounting for stock options and the change in sales  marketing and administrative headcount in any given period 
litigation expenses are expected to vary from period to period due to the volatility of litigation activities

twelve months ended december  to change to change interest and other income  net in millions in the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period in  the increase consists primarily of gains on the purchases of the outstanding convertible notes that were issued in the first quarter of approximately million  net of unamortized note issuance costs and higher interest income primarily due to higher cash and marketable securities balances and interest rates approximately million  offset by amortization of note issuance costs approximately million  the pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in tessera approximately million  and the pre tax gain in from a default on a sublease of our former headquarters approximately million 
in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in interest and other income  net was primarily due to a gain on the sale of our investment in tessera in approximately million 
in the future  we expect that interest and other income  net will vary from period to period based upon notes purchases to extent the purchase value is less than face value  the amount of cash and marketable securities and interest rates 
twelve months ended december  to change to change provision for income taxes in millions in the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate was approximately as compared with a rate of approximately for the comparable period in the effective tax rate increased primarily due to a reduction in foreign tax credits  a reduction in research and development tax credits  and nondeductible stock compensation  partially offset by a decrease in state taxes 
in the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate was approximately as compared with a rate of approximately for the twelve months ended december  the effective tax rate decreased primarily due to state taxes and research and development tax credits 
in the twelve months ended december   we decreased our net deferred tax assets by million  mainly due to tax benefits from the use of net operating loss  the recognition of deferred revenue  and the tax amortization of intangible assets  partially offset by an increase in tax credits 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million is subject to periodic adjustment as facts and circumstances warrant 
the ability to realize the deferred tax asset is dependent on sufficient levels of future taxable income and other factors 
contingent warrants  common stock equivalents  and options warrants in october  our board of directors authorized an incentive program in the form of warrants for a total of up to  shares of our common stock to be issued to various rdram licensees 
the warrants  which 
table of contents were issued at the time certain targets were met  have an exercise price of per share and a life of five years from the date of issuance 
these warrants vest and become exercisable only upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram chipsets  which could result in a non cash charge to the statement of operations based on the fair value of the warrants if and when the achievement of the intel milestones becomes probable 
since intel has phased out the e chipset  we consider the likelihood that the unvested warrants will vest is remote 
as of december   warrants exercisable for a total of  shares had been issued and  remain outstanding 
the remainder of these outstanding warrants expired in january the impact of these warrants has been excluded from the calculation of net income per share 
contingent common stock equivalents and options as of december   there were  contingent unvested common stock equivalents  or cses  and  contingent unvested options  which vest upon the achievement of certain milestones by intel relating to shipment volumes of rdram chipsets 
these cses were granted to our previous chief executive officer ceo and president in and the options were granted to certain of our employees in and the cses were granted with a term of years and the options were granted with an exercise price of and a term of years 
if and when the achievement of the intel milestones become probable  there would be an almost entirely non cash charge to our statement of operations based on the fair value of the cses and options 
since intel has phased out the e chipset  we consider the likelihood that the unvested cses and options will vest is remote 
the impact of these cses and options has been excluded from the calculation of net income per share 
share repurchase program in october  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of our common stock principally to reduce the dilutive effect of employee stock options 
since the beginning of the program  our board has authorized the purchase in open market transactions of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock over an undefined period of time 
as of december   we had repurchased million shares of our common stock at an average price per share of  which includes million shares repurchased in connection with our million zero coupon senior convertible subordinated note offering on february  as of december   there remained an outstanding authorization to repurchase million shares of our outstanding common stock 
liquidity and capital resources twelve months ended december  audited cash flows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including a long term component of million 
as of december   we had total working capital of million  including a short term component of deferred revenue of million 
deferred revenue represents the excess of billings to licensees over revenue recognized on license contracts  and the short term component represents the amount of this deferred revenue expected to be recognized over the next twelve months 
operating activities cash generated by operating activities in the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of net income of million adjusted for certain non cash and non operating items including a gain on 
table of contents the repurchase of our convertible notes million  depreciation approximately million  amortization of intangible assets and note issuance costs approximately million  amortization of stock based compensation approximately million  a decrease in prepaids  deferred taxes and other assets approximately million  and an increase in the tax benefit of stock options exercised approximately million 
this cash generated by operating activities was partially offset by a net decrease in deferred revenue approximately million 
the net decrease in deferred revenue represents revenues recognized in excess of contract billings during the period  primarily related to the revenue associated with our xdr and flexio contracts 
cash generated by operating activities in the twelve months ended december  was primarily the result of net income of million adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in tax benefit of stock options exercised of million 
operating activities were also affected by a decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily related to payments received under xdr and flexio chip interface contracts 
this cash generated from operating activities was partially offset by an increase in prepaids  deferred taxes and other assets of million based primarily due to our election to capitalize certain research and development expenses for tax purposes and a net decrease in deferred revenue of million resulting from contract revenues recognized in excess of contract billings primarily related to increased revenues for xdr and flexio chip interface contracts in which billings were made in the prior year 
in the twelve months ended december   net cash provided by operations was primarily the result of net income of million adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation of million and the tax benefit resulting from stock options exercised of million 
operating activities were also affected by a net increase to deferred revenue of million resulting from contract billings in excess of contract revenues recognized  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily due to increased billings for the xdr and flexio chip interface contracts and increases in prepaids  deferred taxes and other assets of million  primarily due to increased foreign withholding taxes paid on payments received from international licensees and the renewal of software maintenance contracts 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in the twelve months ended december  primarily consisted of net purchases of marketable securities approximately million resulting from the investment of a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes 
in addition  million was used to acquire certain proprietary digital core designs from gda  million was used to acquire certain serial link intellectual property assets from cadence and million was used for the purchase of property and equipment  including computer and software purchases in the united states and computer equipment  software  leasehold improvements and office equipment and furniture for a new facility in india 
the change is partially offset by a reduction in restricted investments approximately million due to the settlement in the infineon case  which removed the restrictions in restricted investments  as discussed in note titled litigation and asserted claims of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview our revenue recognition policy is based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop as amended by statement of position sop and statement of position sop 
additionally  revenue is recognized on some of our products  according to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
our revenues consist of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from agreements with semiconductor companies  system companies and certain reseller arrangements 
royalty revenues consist of product license royalties and patent license royalties 
contract revenues consist of license fees and engineering fees associated with integration of our chip interface products into our customers products 
reseller arrangements generally provide for the payment of license fees associated with the marketing  distribution and sublicensing  and in some circumstances  fabricating of our interface technologies 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is permitted in the cancellation provisions and any cancellations would have an effect on revenue recognition that is prospective in nature 
royalty revenues we recognize royalty revenues upon notification by the licensees if collectibility is reasonably assured 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require licensees to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
from time to time  we engage accounting firms independent of our independent registered public accounting firm to perform  on our behalf  periodic audits of some of the licensee s reports of royalties to us and any adjustment resulting from such royalty audits is recorded in the period such adjustment is determined 
we have two types of royalty revenues product license royalties and patent license royalties 

table of contents product licenses 
we develop proprietary and industry standard chip interface products  such as rdram and xdr  that we provide to our customers under product license agreements which are incorporated into their semiconductor and systems products 
these arrangements include royalties which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a quarterly basis upon notification from the licensee if collectibility is reasonably assured 
patent licenses 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and systems companies  such as intel and amd  who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable as the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
contract revenue we have elected to recognize revenue in accordance the provisions of sop for licenses of our chip interface products  such as xdr and flexio that involve significant engineering services to help our customers integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems  revenues from such licenses are recognized over the period that we perform services 
revenues derived from such license and engineering services are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we review assumptions regarding the work necessary to complete projects on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
conversely  if the new estimated total amount of work necessary to complete a project was longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized over a longer period 
we have elected to recognize revenue in accordance with sop  sop and sop for licenses of our chip interface products that don t involve significant engineering services 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the products and services provided under these agreements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees 
contract fees are bundled together as the total price of the agreement does not vary as a result of inclusion or exclusion of services and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for the undelivered element has not been established 
accordingly  after we have delivered the product and the only undelivered element is post contract customer support pcs  we recognize revenue ratably over either the contractual pcs period or the period during which pcs is expected to be provided 
these remaining pcs obligations are essential to the functionality of the product and are primarily to keep the product updated and include activities such as responding to inquiries and periodic customer meetings 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees are due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
we review assumptions regarding the post contract customer support periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  if the new estimated periods were shorter than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a shorter period 
conversely  if the new estimated periods were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a longer period 
we assess whether the fee associated with each transaction is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured and evaluate the payment terms 
if a portion of the fee is due beyond normal payment terms  we recognize the revenue on the payment due date  assuming collection is reasonably assured 
we assess 
table of contents collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the overall credit worthiness of the customer 
if collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues in any given period 
litigation as of december   we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note titled litigation and asserted claims of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with the outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we have not accrued any amounts for potential losses related to these proceedings 
because of uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation 
we will record accruals for losses if and when we determine the negative outcome of such matters to be probable and reasonably estimable 
our estimates regarding such losses could differ from actual results 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
this process requires us to calculate various items including permanent and temporary differences between the financial accounting and tax treatment of certain income and expense items  differences between federal and state tax treatment of these items  the amount of taxable income reported to various states  foreign taxes and tax credits 
the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes results in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of approximately million  relating primarily to the difference between tax and book treatment of depreciation and amortization  employee stock related compensation expenses  deferred revenue  net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we have established a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of certain assets 
the valuation allowance as of december  of approximately million relates to the tax benefit of the employee stock related compensation expense 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from the estimates or we adjust the estimates in future periods  an additional valuation allowance may have to be recorded  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
stock options are generally granted with exercise prices equivalent to fair market value  and no compensation cost is recognized 

table of contents when stock options are granted with exercise prices below fair market value  employee stock related compensation expense is recognized accordingly 
on january   we granted  shares of restricted stock to our ceo and president 
the price of the underlying shares is per share 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the deferred stock based compensation was amortized ratably over the vesting period of six months and a total of million was recorded in marketing  general and administrative expense in the year ended december  there was no outstanding deferred stock based compensation balance as of december  we comply with the disclosure provisions as required under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  issued in december for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the estimated fair value of the stock awards is amortized ratably to expense over the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite services 
the fair value of the options is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility 
our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
for the year ended december   we used an equally weighted historical and market based implied volatility for the computation of stock based compensation 
for the years ended december  and  we used historical volatility for the computation of stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r  revising sfas no 
the revision supersedes apb no 
and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative use of the intrinsic value method permitted under apb no 
and requires publicly traded companies to measure the cost of equity based awards granted to employees based on the grant date fair value of the award 
we will adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
we will apply the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
short term and long term marketable securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated tax 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
in general  securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interest rate risk than those with shorter maturities 
due in part to this factor  our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates
