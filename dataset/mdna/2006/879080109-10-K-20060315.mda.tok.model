item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for an overview of operations and trends within the industry 
within our commercial industrial segment  we lease land to various types of tenants 
we currently lease land to a full service truck stop facility  a truck wash  four auto service stations with convenience stores  four fast food operations  two full service restaurants  two motels  an antique shop  and a united states postal service facility 
we are also involved in a joint venture that owns and operates a acre travel and truck stop facility  called petro travel plaza 
petro travel plaza also operates two separate gas stations with convenience stores within tic west 
in addition  several microwave repeater locations  radio and cellular transmitter sites  and fiber optic cable routes are also leased 
we also lease acres to calpine for an electric power plant and own and lease one office building in rancho santa fe  california 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf of dry gas during our share of production  based upon prevailing average royalty rates during the last three years  has been   and barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately producing oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates on the property a cement manufacturing plant with a capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process 
see item  legal proceedings  for a further discussion 
our resort residential segment activities include conceptual design planning and entitlement activities related to our lands 
during  the centennial development  a large master planned community development encompassing  acres of our land  continued the environmental review process within the los angeles county planning department that commenced in the environmental review process itself could take some time to complete and we are estimating that it could take several years to ultimately receive the required regulatory approvals from los angeles county to begin development of this project 
upon completion of the centennial development it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when completed  would create a substantial number of jobs 
in addition to the centennial community project  we are engaged in the environmental review and approval process within the kern county planning department for the tmv community 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  very low density  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  educational and cultural programs  themed retail shopping  concierge services  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
we entered into a non binding letter of intent  or the letter  with dmb associates inc  or dmb  in november  which sets forth the principle terms of a proposed joint venture operating agreement to be entered into between the parties relating to the entitlement and development of tmv 
a binding commitment with respect to the transaction contemplated by the letter would result only from the successful execution and delivery of a joint venture operating agreement and completion of the due diligence period 
it is expected that the agreement and due diligence will be completed within the next few months 
in the letter  the parties have preliminarily agreed to secure all entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to develop and own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  and golf course sites in tmv 
in the contemplated joint venture  trc will contribute rights to all studies  research  and other work which trc has done related to tmv  as well as  acres comprising the tmv site at the time entitlements have been successfully obtained and litigated  while dmb will contribute up to a total of  to fund entitlement efforts and development 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial and residential real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition is impacted by such factors as the supply of comparable real estate available for sale or lease and the level of demand for that real estate 
currently  our greatest competition for commercial industrial development comes from land in the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial project will come from developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  pistachios  and walnuts we also grow wheat on approximately acres and alfalfa and forage mix on acres in the antelope valley 
we also lease acres of land that is used for the growing of vegetables 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices received by us for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
in  our almonds were sold to various commercial buyers  with two of the buyers each receiving approximately of the crop 
we do not believe we would be adversely affected by the loss of either or both of our largest buyers because of the size of the almond market  the large number of other buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer 
in  the majority of our pistachios were sold to one customer and our walnuts were sold to two customers  each purchasing approximately of the crop 
we believe that the loss of any of these customers would not adversely impact us because  like almonds  there are a number of potential purchasers of pistachios and walnuts and prices do not change based on the identity of the buyer 
during  the majority of harvested wine grapes were sold to two wineries 
the imbalance between the supply and demand of wine grapes over the last few years has continued to decline and  as a result  prices for our grapes have continued to increase 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
our water entitlement for available from the state water project was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources has announced its water supply at of full entitlement 
other water supplies that the local water district will be able to make available to its farmers  combined with this level of state entitlement  are expected to provide a level of water supply that will cover all of our farming needs 
if in any year the local water district cannot meet all of our agricultural demands  we will rely on ground water sources  water transfers from the tejon castac water district and water banking arrangements into which we have entered 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and transfer costs  but can be expected to make up for shortfalls of the kind we have experienced in the past 
see discussion of water contract entitlement and long term outlook for water supply under part i  item  properties 
customers in  pistachio growers incorporated accounted for approximately of revenue from continuing operations and calpine generating company  a lessee of land  accounted for approximately of revenue from continuing operations 
in  hughson nut  a purchaser of almonds  accounted for approximately of revenues from continuing operations and pistachio growers incorporated accounted for of revenues from continuing operations 
in  no single customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues from continuing operations

item a 
risk factors the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves significant risk and could result in operating losses 
we are involved in a cyclical industry and are affected by changes in general and local economic conditions 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
higher interest rates can have a significant impact on the real estate industry 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
we are subject to various land use regulations and require governmental approvals for our developments that could be denied 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which would adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
the los angeles county planning department released a set of draft amendments to the los angeles county general plan that would extend a planning overlay designation called sensitive ecological areas to cover most of the footprint of the centennial project 
it is not clear at this early stage what chance this draft has of being adopted by the los angeles county board of supervisors or what its impact on centennial would be  but if adopted it would likely involve additional processing time  studies  and findings by county officials  which could have an adverse impact similar to the density provisions described above and  at worst  could provide a pretext for denying the centennial application 
in addition  many states  cities and counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
third party litigation could increase the time and cost of our development efforts 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
we are subject to environmental regulations and opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor and other species of concern  presumed removal of oak trees  the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors  potential impacts of our projects on traffic and air quality in los angeles county  and criticism of proposed development in rural areas as being sprawl 
until governmental entitlements are received  we will have a limited inventory of real estate 
each of our four current and planned real estate projects  the tic west and east  centennial and tmv  involve obtaining governmental entitlements 
a delay in obtaining governmental entitlements could lead to additional costs related to these developments and potentially lost opportunities for the sale of lots to developers and land users 
we are in competition with several other developments for customers and residents 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
centennial ultimately would compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tmv will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will include a greater area and range of projects 
negotiations regarding the development of the planned tejon mountain village community may not be successful 
our subsidiary  tejon ranchcorp  has entered into a non binding letter of intent with dmb associates inc that sets forth the principal terms of a proposed joint venture operating agreement to be entered into between the parties relating to the entitlement and development of tmv 
however  a binding commitment with respect to the transaction contemplated by the letter of intent would result only from completion of the due diligence period and the negotiation and execution of a joint venture operating agreement  which negotiation has only recently commenced and may not be successful 
our developable land is concentrated entirely in california 
all of our developable land is in california 
any adverse change in the economic climate of california  or our region of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  or the counties where our land is located could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions or restrictive regulations 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is strong in the real estate and land development industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
only a limited market exists for our common stock which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 
concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of march   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  our lease portfolio is protected to some extent from inflation  since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in our leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation 
we may encounter other risks that could impact our ability to develop our land 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  heavy rains and flooding and heavy winds  shortages of qualified trades people  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of certain materials 
item properties our  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan  or the general plan  for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to any amendment of the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies that contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for a master planned community on  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain and much of the land is not presently served by paved roads or by utility or water lines 
any significant development of the land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species and wetlands issues  which may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays in getting governmental approval 
rural agricultural development of much of our mountain land could be accomplished without many or any such approvals  constraints  and or investments  but we have not to date pursued this avenue of development 
water rights existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  or wheeler ridge water district  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the california state water project to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional entitlement to obtain from the california state water project sufficient water to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  or tejon castac  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in the tejon industrial complex  has  acre feet of state water project entitlement  or enough to supply over  average families assuming delivery 
in addition  tejon castac has over  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tejon castac and our company 
tejon castac is the principal water supplier to the tejon industrial complex  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tmv 
during  project allocations were  and the wheeler ridge water district was able to supply us with of our farming demands 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the higher priced state water project water 
both the wheeler ridge water district and tejon castac are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
the wheeler ridge water district expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the state water project deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if state water project deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if less severe shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then the wheeler ridge water district may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfers from tejon castac and water banking assets to supply the shortfalls to our farming operations 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
also  as we develop our real estate for residential  commercial and industrial uses  there will be less water available for agriculture from tejon castac 
a allocation has been made by the state water project for with this allocation  along with the wheeler ridge water district s additional supplies  we believe that we will have adequate water supplies for farming in the water contracts with the wheeler ridge water district and with tejon castac require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the california state water project and each district  whether or not water is used or available 
the wheeler ridge water district contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
the water agency serving the los angeles county portion of our land  the antelope valley east kern water agency  has significant surplus entitlement and  although no assurance has been given  it has indicated that it would be able to provide a significant portion of the water needed for centennial 
portions of our property also have available groundwater 
that source would be sufficient to supply significant commercial development in the interstate corridor and provide a significant portion of the water needed for development at centennial and tmv 
ground water in the antelope valley basin has recently become the subject of litigation 
please refer to item  legal proceedings 
historic state water project restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or commercial industrial developments 
however  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge water district agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 
the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority community facilities district cfd  a joint powers authority formed by kern county and the tejon castac water district  has placed liens on  acres of the company s land 
these liens are to secure payment of special taxes related to million of bond debt sold by the cfd 
the company is obligated  as a landowner in the district  to pay its share of the special taxes assessed each year 
the  acres of land includes the tejon industrial complex development 
proceeds from the sale of cfd bonds went to reimburse the company for public infrastructure related to the tejon industrial complex development 
in   was reimbursed through these bond funds 
in  and  the company paid approximately   and  respectively  in special taxes related to the cfd 
as development continues to occur at tejon industrial complex  new owners of land and new lease tenants  through triple net leases  will bear an increasing portion of the assessed special tax 
as this happens  the company s obligation is reduced 
it is expected that the company will have special tax payments in of approximately  but this could change in the future based on the amount of bonds outstanding within the cfd and the amount of taxes paid by others 
as development and values increase around the tejon industrial complex  the company may be able to have approximately  acres released from the cfd lien item legal proceedings we lease land to national for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits on the leased acreage 
national s former subtenant  systech environmental corporation  is awaiting action by the california department of toxic substances control in order to achieve regulatory closure for its former facility that burned hazardous waste as a supplemental fuel in the cement plant located on land leased from the company 
the california regional water quality control board  or rwqcb  for the lahontan region has issued several orders with respect to four environmental conditions on the property groundwater plume of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds 
this order directs the company s former tenant lafarge corporation  or lafarge  the current tenant national  and the company to  among other things  investigate the source and extent of the groundwater contamination and initiate cleanup 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have completed their investigation  and are operating a groundwater pump and treat system to clean up the groundwater 
in and  lafarge and national removed certain soils from the property that were the principal source of the contamination 
cement kiln dust 
national and lafarge have consolidated  closed and capped cement kiln dust piles located on land leased from the company 
an order of the rwqcb directs national  lafarge and the company to maintain and monitor the effectiveness of the cap 
maintenance of the cap and groundwater monitoring remain as on going activities 
groundwater contamination levels down gradient of the cap exceeded limits set by the rwqcb following record breaking rains in late winter the company is advised that national and lafarge are conducting studies and developing a plan to minimize the chances of this occurring again 
former industrial waste landfills 
this order requires lafarge  national and the company to complete the cleanup of groundwater associated with former industrial waste landfills 
the company is advised that lafarge is addressing the low level contamination by natural attenuation and that monitoring remains an ongoing activity 
lafarge previously removed waste historically disposed of in the landfills and transported that waste off site for disposal 
diesel fuel 
an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national and the company to investigate and clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
the company is advised that lafarge and national have completed their investigation and groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains an on going activity 
some oil contamination located beneath plant buildings and equipment remains on the property 
to date  the company is not aware of any other failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or informal requests of the rwqcb 
the company has not been directed by the rwqcb to perform any remedial activities 
under the lease between national and the company  national is obligated to indemnify the company for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of its use of the leased premises 
lafarge has liability for all obligations under the indemnity provisions arising before the november assignment of the lease from lafarge to national 
the company believes that all of the matters described above are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations 
the company believes that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any possible or reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and the company is required to perform the likely remedial work at its own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by the company would be material 
on february   the center for biological diversity and other environmental groups filed a lawsuit in kern county superior court against kern county 
this suit challenged the county s certification of the environmental impact report  or eir  for tejon industrial complex east  or tic east  the company s  acre expansion of the industrial park at the south end of the san joaquin valley 
principal environmental issues raised in the suit involved the project s likely effects on air quality and on species of concern  the impact of converting farmland to developed land and the related potential for growth inducement  and the cumulative impact of the project when combined with other development on company land and elsewhere 
the suit also challenged the land use entitlements granted by the county as being inconsistent with the county s general plan and zoning policies 
two subsidiaries of the company are the real parties in interest 
the company has an obligation to indemnify and defend the county and has undertaken defense of this suit in close coordination with county counsel 
on october   the kern county superior court issued a ruling in this case voiding the county s certification of the eir based on two grounds 
first  the court found that there was not sufficient evidence that the eir adequately described the impacts that tic east would have on the air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin 
the principal reason for this conclusion was that certain data and guidance provided by local air quality districts  which was cited  discussed and relied upon in the eir  could not be used to support the county s decision because it was not physically included in the administrative record 
second  two species of concern ie species not listed under the state and federal endangered species acts but which are for other reasons required to be discussed in eirs if they could be affected by a development found on or near the project site were not specifically discussed in the eir  due to an inadvertent oversight by the consulting biologists 
the court found that the eir was adequate in all other aspects  and ruled in favor of the company on separate claims asserted by plaintiffs under the laws governing planning and zoning in california 
the court retained jurisdiction over the case 
a supplemental environmental analysis was prepared to address the air quality and biological issues described above 
in response to comments from the county staff  we changed the uses allowed under the specific plan and increased the mitigation measures to be provided  which will serve to further reduce the air quality impacts addressed by the court 
these changes to allowed uses are not expected to be material from a commercial perspective because they principally delete uses that are not considered to be commercially viable but which were generally permitted by the previous specific plan 
the project approvals  including the changes described above  were resubmitted to the kern county board of supervisors for consideration and action in light of the additional information contained in the supplemental environmental analysis 
the kern county board of supervisors certified the corrected eir incorporating the supplemental environmental analysis and approved the project in november the corrected eir has been returned to the court for its review 
plaintiffs have contested the adequacy of the corrected eir before the kern county board of supervisors and the court  which could result in further delays before the company can develop the land 
on november   a complaint was filed asking for the antelope valley ground water basin to be adjudicated 
this means that the rights of all parties overlying the basin  including the company s land  should be permanently fixed based on various principles of water law and on negotiations among the principal parties or groups of water users 
it is too early to ascertain what effect  if any  this case may have on the centennial project or the company s remaining lands in the antelope valley 
because the water supply plan for the centennial project includes several sources of water in addition to ground water underlying the company s lands  and because the creation of an efficient market for local water rights is frequently an outcome of adjudication proceedings  we anticipate that sufficient water to supply the centennial project s needs will continue to be available for its use

we are a diversified real estate development and agribusiness company committed to responsibly using our land and resources to meet the housing  employment  and lifestyle needs of californians and to create value for our shareholders 
in support of these objectives  we have been investing in land planning and entitlement activities for new industrial and residential land developments and in infrastructure improvements within our active industrial development 
our prime asset is approximately  acres of contiguous  largely undeveloped land that  at its most southerly border  is miles north of los angeles and  at its most northerly border  is miles east of bakersfield 
our business model is designed to create value through the entitlement and development of land for commercial industrial and resort residential uses while at the same time protecting significant portions of our land for conservation purposes 
we operate our business near one of the country s largest population centers  which is expected to continue to grow well into the future 
we currently operate in three business segments commercial industrial real estate development and services  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
commercial industrial real estate development generates revenues from lease activities  land sales  build to suit building sales and leases  oil and mineral royalties and grazing leases 
resort residential land development does not currently produce revenues but is actively involved in the land entitlement process 
farming produces revenues from the sale of grapes  almonds  pistachios  and walnuts 
for  we have net income of  compared to net income of  for revenues from continuing operations for grew  to  expenses from continuing operations for were  an increase of  when compared to the growth in revenue is due to an improvement in revenue from our farm crops  increased royalties from oil and minerals  and higher leasing revenue 
the improvement in farm crop revenue is primarily due to higher prices for our almonds  pistachios  and grapes 
our royalty income from oil and minerals grew due to higher prices for oil and cement 
leasing revenue increased due to higher revenues from our power plant lease 
the largest components of the increase in expense for the year are staffing costs  including higher stock compensation expense  marketing and public relations costs related to our development projects  and increased operational costs related to water  repairs and fuel 
income from continuing operations for is  compared to a loss of  during during  we had net income of  compared to a loss of  for revenues from continuing operations for were  an increase of  when compared to expenses from continuing operations for were  which is an increase of  when compared to  during increased farming revenues of  and improved commercial industrial revenue of  drove the improvement in revenue 
the increase in farming revenue was due primarily to higher prices and greater production of almonds  grapes  and pistachios 
commercial industrial revenue growth was due to improvements in oil and mineral royalties and leasing revenues 
the largest component of the increase in expense was  of costs related to the stock incentive plan 
this plan was approved by our shareholders in and provides for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the achievement of performance and milestone objectives 
additional increases in expense were caused by higher staffing costs and higher professional service fees 
staffing costs increased due to additional staff and higher employee benefit costs 
professional service fees increased due to real estate entitlement activities and costs related to sarbanes oxley activities  new internal audit costs  and higher external audit costs 
the loss from continuing operations for was  compared to a loss of  during offsetting the loss from continuing operations in were profits from discontinued operations after taxes of  the discontinued operations profits were generated from the gain on the sale of our investment in pacific almond  an almond processing plant  and from the gain on the sale of three buildings in phoenix  arizona 
during  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock  resulting in gross proceeds of  and net proceeds of  additional information regarding the private placement is included within the cash flow and liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during  we will continue to invest funds toward the achievement of entitlements for our land and for infrastructure development within our active industrial developments 
the process of securing entitlements for our land is a long  arduous process and could take several years 
over this time  our net income will fluctuate year to year based upon commodity prices and production within our farming segment and upon the timing of sales of land and the leasing of land within our industrial development 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides the reader of our financial statements with a narrative discussion of our results of operations 
it contains the results of operations for each business segment of the business and is followed by a discussion of our financial position 
it is useful to read the business segment information in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  business segments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimates that are likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  stock compensation  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from rental revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease unless there is a considerable risk as to collectibility 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
royalty revenues are contractually defined and are generally based upon production 
rental revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  to record these sales 
sfas no 
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  sfas no 
requires a land sale must be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold 
at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues and any related inventory costs are recognized  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
orchard almonds  pistachios  and walnuts revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenues to be  or per pound on average  pistachio revenue to be  or per pound  and walnut revenue to be  or per pound 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  prices received on almonds have ranged from to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound  and walnut prices have ranged from 
to 
per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were 
from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds in was to per pound 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimate range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue by  in  decreased farming revenue by  in  and increased farming revenue by  in the large adjustments in and related to continuing increases in almond and pistachio prices prior to the receipt of our final scheduled payments 
capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we follow sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land  we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates  we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward  due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during and  
per square foot of cost was allocated to sold and leased land as a cost of development 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will become even more significant as we continue to move forward as a real estate development company 
the estimates used are very susceptible to change from period to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion  and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in our financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
we currently operate in three segments  commercial industrial real estate development  resort residential real estate development  and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within either of our real estate segments or our farming segment that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s domestic plans consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
if we were to assume a basis point change in the discount rate used  our periodic pension cost would increase or decrease approximately  and our projected benefit obligation would increase or decrease approximately  stock based compensation we apply the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for long term stock based incentive plans 
no compensation cost related to grants of stock options was reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market price 
no stock options were granted during or see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  common stock and stock option information  for the annual impact if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we also make stock awards to employees based upon time based criteria and through the achievement of performance related objectives 
performance related objectives are stratified into threshold  target  and maximum goals 
these stock awards are currently being expensed over the expected vesting period based on each performance criterion 
we make estimates as to the number of shares that will actually be granted based upon estimated ranges of success in meeting the defined performance measures 
if our estimates of performance shares vesting were to change by  stock compensation expense would increase or decrease by  depending on whether the change in estimate increased or decreased shares vesting 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  stock compensation plan  for total stock compensation expense 
new accounting pronouncements the accounting policies adopted during were related to new accounting pronouncements and the adoption of these policies did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
on october   fasb concluded that statement no 
revised  share based payment  or statement r  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments at fair value  would be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission announced a rule amending the compliance dates for statement r 
this means that we are now required to implement the standard for the first quarter of we currently follow apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and  because the exercise price of stock options granted equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense has been recognized 
using the modified prospective method  the potential impact to the company of applying statement r in will be approximately  after income tax benefits 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  was issued in march this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in fasb statement no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity on which timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
we have reviewed fasb interpretation no 
and concluded that this new pronouncement has no impact on operations or reporting at this time 
fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  was issued during may this statement has been issued as a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
this statement requires retrospective application of any change in accounting principles to the financial statements of prior periods  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects  this statement requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in the income statement 
we have reviewed fasb statement no 
and concluded that this pronouncement will not have an impact on operations or reporting at this time 
results of operations by segment we evaluate the performance of our operating segments separately to monitor the different factors affecting financial results 
each segment is subject to review and evaluation as we monitor current market conditions  market opportunities  and available resources 
the performance of each segment is discussed below real estate commercial industrial our commercial industrial segment profits during increased  or  when compared to segment profits 
the improvement in segment profits was driven by an increase in revenues of  the growth in revenues was primarily driven by higher leasing revenues and higher oil and mineral royalty revenues 
lease revenues increased approximately  during the year 
this increase was largely due to higher revenues from our power plant lease with calpine 
power plant lease revenue improved due to the ending of a grace period during that was related to the timing of construction of the plant and to the receipt of variable rent payments associated with the plant s production 
oil and mineral royalties improved during due to higher prices for oil and increased production and prices for cement and rock aggregate product 
expenses during increased  primarily due to staffing costs  marketing costs  water costs  and repairs and fuel costs 
staffing costs increased  due to higher benefit costs  annual salary increases  the conversion of part time employees to full time  and to an increase of  in stock compensation expense 
an increase of  in marketing costs was related to the beginning of new marketing campaigns designed to generate new activity within our commercial industrial developments 
fixed water costs increased  during the year due to higher operating costs and water costs within a local water district 
repairs and fuel costs increased  due to higher gasoline and diesel costs  repairs on the ranch related to winter storm damage  and to the demolition of an old  previously leased commercial building 
during december  the tenant of the power plant lease  calpine  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
we believe that during the bankruptcy restructuring the plant will remain operational and we will continue to receive our base lease payments and variable lease payments during this assumption is based upon the structure of our lease with calpine  discussions with calpine  and the fact that the plant is currently profitable 
as of the date of this report  we have not heard from the bankruptcy court regarding whether or not our lease has been affirmed  but we expect it to be 
if for some reason calpine or another operator does not continue to operate the plant  the loss of lease payments would significantly impact our commercial industrial segment revenues 
future activities within the commercial industrial segment will be focused on the marketing and development of commercial industrial product and the obtaining of final entitlements for the tic east development 
during  the market for our industrial product began to improve compared to the market conditions of and and the tejon dermody joint venture was successful in leasing a  square foot building to oneida  ikea  and regency air 
our marketing efforts continue to be focused on educating potential users about the logistical benefits of our site and the success that current tenants and owners within our development have experienced 
we believe that as california s population continues to grow and the economy continues its expansion  we will begin to see an increase in industrial activity at tejon industrial complex 
our development fits very well within the logistics model that companies are using  which favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
we believe that our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size will provide us with a potential marketing advantage 
a potential disadvantage is our distance from the port of los angeles in comparison to the traditional warehouse distribution centers east of los angeles 
during  we signed a development agreement with the rockefeller group development corporation to create a foreign trade zone within our development and to enter into joint ventures to develop buildings for sale or lease to end users 
the commercial industrial segment will continue to experience increases in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement and development related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and market factors 
these types of real estate development activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 
we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial and industrial properties 
commercial industrial segment profits of  in were  or  less than segment profits 
the decline in segment profit was due to an increase in expenses during that more than offset the growth in revenue during the year 
overall for  revenue grew by  and expenses increased by  the improvement in revenue during was attributable to increases in oil and mineral royalties of  and an overall improvement in leasing revenue of  these improvements were partially offset by gains from the sale of land during oil and mineral royalty revenue grew due to higher oil prices  higher oil production from oil leases  and to increased cement and rock production from tenants 
lease revenue improved during due primarily to additional revenue from the power plant lease with calpine 
power plant lease revenue increased due to the ending of a grace period during that was related to the timing of construction of the plant 
expenses were higher in due primarily to increases in staffing costs 
these increases in expense are tied to our increase in activities related to industrial development and the entitlement of land as well as to the costs attributable to a new stock incentive plan 
during  staffing costs increased  due to additional staff related to property management and maintenance and to  of cost related to the stock incentive plan 
our stock incentive plan provides for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the achievement of performance and milestone objectives 
costs related to this plan will continue forward for the next several years 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
see part i  item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
real estate resort residential our resort residential segment activities include conceptual design planning and entitlement activities related to our potential residential developments  which include the centennial master planned community and tmv 
the resort residential segment had operating losses of  during  an increase of  when compared to the prior year 
the increase in expense over the prior year was driven by several smaller variances  the largest of which was an increase of  in marketing and public relations activity related to our development and environmental activities and a  increase in staffing costs 
staffing costs increased due to the addition of new employees and stock compensation expense 
near term activities within this segment will be focused on obtaining entitlements for the centennial project  located in los angeles county  and tmv in kern county 
the resort residential segment will continue to experience increases in costs in the future related to professional service fees  public relations costs  and staffing costs as we continue the entitlement process for the above developments 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and the likelihood of litigation upon approval of our entitlements in the future 
it could take several years to ultimately receive the required regulatory approvals 
our long term goal through this process is to increase the value of our land and create future revenue opportunities through resort and residential development 
for the tmv project we are currently working with dmb associates inc  or dmb  to formalize a joint venture operating agreement for the entitlement and development of the project 
we currently have a non binding letter of intent with dmb in which we have preliminarily agreed to secure entitlements and all necessary regulatory approvals  to master plan  develop and sell parcels and homes to end users  and to own  sell or joint venture commercial properties  hotels  golf course sites in tmv 
in the contemplated joint venture  trc will contribute rights to all studies  research  and other work which trc has done related to tmv  as well as  acres comprising the tmv site at the time entitlements have been successfully obtained and litigated  while dmb will contribute up to a total of  to fund entitlement efforts and development 
we expect the agreement to be completed within the next few months 
once the agreement is completed  our future cost obligation related to tmv will be greatly reduced by the amount of contributions dmb will be providing to the joint venture for entitlement and development activities 
the resort residential segment had operating losses of  in  an improvement of  from the prior year 
the decrease in expense was due to lower staffing costs of  owing to a reduction in staff resulting from a realignment of the division and to lower marketing and public relations costs due to the commencement of a new public relations program during the last half of these favorable variances were partially offset by an increase in professional service fees of  the increase in professional service fees is connected to our development activities and to legal costs related to habitat conservation plans that we are developing 
see part i  item  business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
farming farming segment profits were  in  an increase of  when compared to the prior year 
the growth in farming segment profits is due primarily to higher pistachio and grape revenue  as well as the receipt of  in proceeds from our local water districts  comprising our percentage of proceeds from the settlement of a case brought by our local water districts concerning water illegally taken by the federal government in the early s 
these improvements in revenue were partially offset by higher staffing costs  water costs  and repair and fuel costs 
staffing costs increased  due to additional staff and a  increase in stock compensation expense during the year 
water costs increased  due to higher variable cost charges that are related to the movement of water out of the california aqueduct to our orchards and vineyards 
repair and fuel costs increased  primarily due to an increase in equipment owned and to higher input costs such as diesel and repair parts 
grape revenues increased  when compared to the prior year due to increased production and a per ton improvement in the average price we received for our grapes 
the improvement in price is a continuation of a trend that began in and is primarily due to the current level of statewide production better matching the needs of wine producers 
we anticipate prices in to be comparable to the per ton we averaged for the crop 
almond revenue declined  during to  when compared to  despite record almond prices 
almond prices averaged per pound for compared to per pound for the decline in revenue was due primarily to approximately  fewer pounds of current year crop being sold when compared to the number of pounds of the crop sold in this decline in current year crop pounds sold was partially offset by the sale of approximately  of crop almonds that were in inventory at the end of total production was approximately  pounds  compared to approximately  pounds of production in of the production  approximately  pounds of almonds is being carried in ending inventory 
the majority of these almonds have been contracted  but the sales process has not been completed due to the fact that the delivery dates for the almonds are scheduled for early the revenue from the sale of these almonds will be recognized during the increase in prices we saw during was related to the continuing increase in worldwide demand for almonds  which helped to increase exports 
this growth in demand kept pace with the increasing production of almonds within california 
on average  we continue to expect production to increase for almonds within california as new trees are planted and young trees begin to produce more product 
this increase in production can impact pricing if demand for the product does not keep pace 
thus far in  the price for almonds has dropped from the highs reached during due to uncertainty over the size of the crop 
we do not expect the high almond prices achieved during to continue over an extended period of time  but do expect prices to stay above historical averages for most of due to current demand levels 
our long term expectations are for lower prices for our almond crop  based on industry projections that production will continue to increase in the future for almonds 
pistachio revenue totaled  in  an increase of  when compared to pistachio revenue 
the increase in revenue was primarily driven by the average price per pound increasing to during  compared to during this change in price accounted for approximately  of the increase in revenue when compared to the increase in price is attributable to improving demand for pistachios and to low industry inventory levels from the prior year due to strong demand in for pistachios 
we expect our revenues from pistachios to decline when compared to due primarily to lower production resulting from the alternate bearing production cycle of pistachios 
the drop in production could potentially be offset by the improvement in prices we saw during all of our crops are sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with current grape production more in line with demand  the pressure on prices has been alleviated at the present time and grape prices should stabilize at increased levels 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios  will increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not continue to keep pace with production 
a positive factor for the almond industry is that demand for product has remained very strong both in the united states and in export markets and at this time this trend is expected to continue 
however  improved global production or a significant increase in the value of the dollar could negatively impact exports and hurt the current pricing for almonds 
farming segment profits of  in reflect an increase of  when compared to a loss of  in the improvement in segment profits was due to increases in pistachio  almond and grape revenue as well as a reduction in cultural costs and fixed water costs 
cultural costs declined  primarily due to the timing of recognition of costs related to harvested almonds that were contracted for sale but were not scheduled for delivery until fixed water costs fell  due to credits received during related to costs 
grape revenues increased  during  due primarily to increases in the prices received for our grapes 
prices increased in over the average price received in the increase in price was attributable to the statewide production of grapes coming into line with the demand for producing wine 
in previous years  grape producers  because of low prices  were eliminating acreage from production to help minimize the oversupply of grapes 
the supply and demand pattern began to change in  resulting in improved prices to grape producers 
almond revenue increased  during when compared to due to significantly higher prices and improved production 
prices increased on average compared to  to a high of per pound 
production during increased  pounds when compared to the increase in prices received for almonds was driven by significant increases in demand for almonds around the world 
pistachio revenue increased significantly to  during  from  in pistachios are an alternate bearing crop with one year having high production followed by a lower production year 
was a high production year  with the volume of production increasing  pounds over for a further discussion of the farming operations  refer to part i  item i  business farming operations 
interest interest income for of  increased  due to an increase in average funds invested during compared to  improving yields on new invested funds  and the receipt of interest from loans to joint ventures 
interest income for of  increased  due to a significant increase in funds invested throughout that year 
the additional funds were the result of a private placement of common stock completed in these new funds were invested in various types of marketable securities  the maturity dates of which were structured to match future estimated needs within our real estate segments

during  we paid  in fees as the result of the defeasance of debt associated with the three buildings in phoenix  arizona sold in this expense is shown in discontinued operations 
corporate expenses corporate expenses increased  to  during the increase during is due to higher staffing costs and stock compensation costs that were partially offset by reduced professional service fees 
staffing costs increased  due to the addition of new staff  annual salary increases  and to increased retirement benefit costs 
stock compensation expense increased  when compared to due primarily to a full year of cost during  compared to only nine months of cost in our stock incentive plan provides for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the achievement of performance and milestone objectives 
costs related to this plan will continue forward for the next several years

our portion of earnings consisted of profits from the petro joint venture of  losses from the tejon dermody joint venture of  losses from the centennial joint venture of  and losses of  from the five west parcel joint venture 
during  the petro joint venture produced a slight decrease in total profits when compared to the decrease was largely due to higher operating costs being offset by improved fuel margins 
operating losses improved within the tejon dermody joint venture due to the leasing of a building within that joint venture during the third quarter of the centennial joint venture loss declined  when compared to the prior year due to an improvement in revenue from operations within the joint venture 
during  we recognized net earnings of  from unconsolidated joint ventures 
our portion of earnings consisted of profits from petro joint venture of  losses from the tejon dermody joint venture of  and losses from the centennial joint venture of  the operations at petro improved over due to improved margins on fuel sales and to a full year of operations within a new convenience store 
the tejon dermody losses are directly related to the vacancy of the building within that joint venture during other than for short term temporary leases 
the loss within the centennial joint venture was related to operations within the centennial planning area 
consistent with our respective ownership interests in the joint ventures  we receive of the earnings and losses in petro and of earnings and losses within the centennial  tejon dermody  and five west parcel joint ventures 
discontinued operations there were no discontinued operations in discontinued operations in consisted of the operations of pacific almond  an almond processing plant  and three commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona that were being held for sale 
during april  we sold our interest in pacific almond to our partner in that joint venture pursuant to the buy sell provisions in the joint venture agreement 
under the purchase agreement  we received  for our interest in the joint venture and the buyer assumed all responsibility for the assets and liabilities of the joint venture 
the gain on the sale of our interest in pacific almond was approximately  before taxes 
in may  the company determined that it was an appropriate time to liquidate our investment in the three commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona due to favorable market conditions and to redirect those funds into our core real estate development business 
these buildings were sold during november  resulting in a net gain of  after transaction costs 
total revenues from discontinued operations for the year of were  compared to  for the same period of revenue from discontinued operations during consisted of  of revenue from the sale of our interest in pacific almond and  of revenue from the sale of buildings in phoenix  arizona 
this compares to  of revenue from the sale of our interest in pacific almond and  in revenue from the sale of buildings in phoenix during the same period of the increase in revenue from pacific almond was due to the recognition of an  gain on the sale of our interest 
this gain was partially offset by the inclusion of only three months of activity in revenue  while included a full year of operating revenue 
the reason for the difference in revenue generated from the buildings is that revenue includes  related to the sale of the buildings in phoenix in november discontinued operations during provided net income of  or 
per diluted share  compared to net income of  or 
per diluted share  for the same period in the improvement from the prior year was primarily due to the recognition of the gain from the sale of our interest in pacific almond and the gains from the sale of the buildings in phoenix 
these improvements were partially offset by the loss from operations of pacific almond for the first three months of and to one of the buildings sold in phoenix being vacant throughout income taxes for financial statement purposes  our effective tax rate for was after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences 
tax expense for was  during  our largest permanent tax difference was related to depletion allowances 
due to the impact of temporary timing differences and the tax benefit of the exercise of stock options  our tax liability for the year was  for  we had net deferred tax assets of  our largest deferred tax assets were made up of temporary differences related to the capitalization of costs  pension adjustments  and stock grant expense 
deferred tax liabilities consist of deferred gains  cost of sale allocations  and straight line rent 
due to the nature of our deferred tax assets  we believe they will be used in future years and an allowance is not necessary 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes was in  after taking into consideration permanent and temporary timing differences resulting in a tax expense of  this tax expense consists of a tax benefit related to continuing operations of  and a tax expense of  related to discontinued operations 
permanent tax differences  primarily related to an increase in depletion allowances  are the reason for the reduced effective tax rate when compared to in  we had a net deferred tax asset of  this amount was primarily made up of short term temporary differences such as deferred revenue  accrued expenses  and prepaid expenses 
our long term temporary differences net to a deferred tax asset of  due to the nature of our net deferred tax assets  we believe they will be utilized in future years through our operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow and liquidity 
our strong financial position allows us to pursue our strategies of land entitlement  development  and conservation 
accordingly  we have established well defined priorities for our available cash  including investing in core business segments to achieve profitable future growth 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to make investments in our real estate segments to secure land entitlement approvals and provide funds for land development activities 
within our farming segment  we will make investments as needed to improve efficiency and add capacity to its operations when it is profitable to do so 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash and marketable securities decreased due primarily to capital expenditures within our developments and in our farming operations 
these capital investments were partially offset by funds from operations and funds from the exercise of stock options 
cash and marketable securities increased dramatically during from prior levels  due primarily to the completion of a private placement on may  for  shares of common stock at a price per share of and two subsequent exercises of options in the form of additional investment rights to purchase  additional shares of common stock at a per share price of and  additional shares of common stock at a per share price of 
the private placement resulted in gross proceeds to the company of  and net proceeds of approximately  in addition to the private placement funds  we received  in reimbursements from a local community facilities district  approximately  in net proceeds from the sale of three buildings in phoenix  arizona and  in proceeds from the sale of pacific almond 
the increased investment in marketable securities was directed into either government securities  agency securities  or corporate securities with a credit rating of a or better 
the maturity dates for these new investments were structured to match future estimated investment needs within our real estate segments 
these increases in cash were partially offset by capital expenditures and the repayment of long term debt 
the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net cash provided by operations during increased to  from  in the increase was due to the improvement in net income  the add back of non cash expenses  and the collection of accounts receivable 
in  our operations provided  of cash  reflecting improved business results  especially when non cash stock compensation costs are added back to operations 
these funds from operating results were partially offset by the significant increase in accounts receivable for accounts receivable increased due to receivables from farming operations growing as a result of increased production and higher prices within almonds and pistachios 
during  we invested  into our continuing operations 
these investments were primarily related to capital investment spending of  and investments in marketable securities 
these uses of funds were partially offset by maturities of investment securities  distributions from joint ventures  and proceeds from the sale of real estate 
in  we used  for investing  primarily reflecting investments in marketable securities of  and capital investment spending of  these uses of funds were partially offset by  of proceeds from a local community facility district as reimbursement of public infrastructure development within tic west and maturities of marketable securities 
capital investments were  in  compared to  in  and  in capital investments for these years were primarily dominated by investments in our real estate projects and our farming operations 
capital investments in our real estate projects are primarily related to infrastructure development and to the capitalization of costs related to our entitlement activities in our real estate projects 
we anticipate that our capital investment requirements for will be approximately  to  these estimated investments include approximately  of infrastructure and entitlement investment at tic west and east   in planning entitlement costs related to the tmv development  and approximately  of investment within our farm operations for the development of a grape vineyard and for the replacement of equipment 
a portion of the infrastructure costs related to tic west and east will not be spent if planned absorption of land does not take place 
cash from financing activities totaled  during this cash was provided by the exercise of stock options during during  financing activities provided  in cash primarily due to net proceeds of  from the private placement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  a portion of these funds were used during to eliminate the outstanding balances on our line of credit 
it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  this nuance of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
capital structure and financial condition 
management considers our capital structure and financial condition to be solid 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of less than one percent  which is comparable to the prior year s debt to total capitalization ratio 
we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had no outstanding balance 
at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at over a selected libor rate or float at less than the bank s prime lending rate 
during the term of this credit facility  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow  as necessary 
any outstanding principal balance is due and payable in full in july this note is unsecured 
the outstanding long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this debt is being used to provide long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks and the debt is secured by the leased building and land 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed parcels  potential sale of assets  additional use of debt  proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through the community facilities district bond debt described below under off balance sheet arrangements  and the issuance of common stock 
as noted above  we have  in cash and securities and  available on credit lines to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial future investments will be required in order to develop our land assets 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we may need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing from any of these sources or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 
we believe we have adequate capital resources to fund our cash needs and our capital investment requirements over the next few years 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of december   to be paid over the next five years payments due by period s in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt interest on fixed rate debt line of credit commitment fees cash contract commitments total contractual obligations the categories above include purchase obligations and other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap 
a purchase obligation is defined in item a ii d of regulation s k as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on 
us 
and that specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
based on this definition  the table above includes only those contracts that include fixed or minimum obligations 
it does not include normal purchases  which are made in the ordinary course of business 
our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments and entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects 
at the present time  we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations outstanding 
our operating lease obligations are for office equipment  a small land lease  and four vehicles and average approximately  per month 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for employee retirement plans 
any payments related to the supplemental executive retirement plan are not included above since they are dependent upon when the employee retires or leaves the company 
in addition  minimum pension funding requirements are not included above  as such amounts are not available for all periods presented 
during  we made approximately  in pension plan contributions 
we estimate that we will contribute approximately  to the pension plan in off balance sheet arrangements the following table shows contingent obligations we have with respect to unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest and with respect to a local community facilities district 
amount of commitment expiration per period s in thousands total one year or less years years other commercial commitments standby letter of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments the standby letter of credit is related to the issuance of community facility district bonds by the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  a joint powers authority created by kern county and the tejon castac water district 
the standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and covers approximately two years worth of interest on the outstanding bonds 
the annual cost for this letter of credit is approximately  per year 
this letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless we  as the largest landowner in the district  fail to make our property tax payments 
this letter of credit is for a two year period and will be renewed if necessary in the guarantees consist of a  guarantee related to debt within the tejon dermody industrial llc  an unconsolidated joint venture  formed to construct and market a  square foot building at the tejon industrial complex 
total debt in the venture is approximately  and was used in the construction of the building 
in the joint venture agreement  each partner agreed to guarantee one half of the outstanding debt through the term of the loan 
the maturity date for this loan has been extended to july  while we finalize the refinancing of this loan 
the refinancing should be completed prior to the new maturity date 
the proposed new loan provides for a reduction in guarantees and an improved interest rate 
we believe it is unlikely that we will ever be required to make payments under this guarantee 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  marketable securities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its long term line of credit  which currently has no outstanding balance  and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the floating rate feature in our line of credit can expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of floating rate interest payments and in the past have entered into interest rate swaps to manage those fluctuations 
at december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
however  petro travel plaza llc  an unconsolidated joint venture  has an interest rate swap agreement with respect to  of its long term debt to manage interest rate risk by converting floating interest rate debt to fixed rate debt 
this swap agreement matures in november and is a contract to exchange variable rate for fixed rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement 
the interest rate swap fixed rate is 
the joint venture accounts for the swap agreement as a cash flow hedge in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative investments and hedging activities 
we record our pro rata change in the fair market value of the interest rate swap in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company s portion of the fair value of the interest rate swap was a gain of  estimated fair value of the swap was determined by market price quotes as of december   received from the joint venture s bank 
market risk related to our inventories ultimately depends on the value of the almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present the related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of our marketable securities and debt obligations 
interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  s in thousands thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities long term debt weighted average interest rate interest rate sensitivity financial market risks principal amount by expected maturity at december  s in thousands thereafter total fair value assets marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities short term debt weighted average interest rate long term debt weighted average interest rate in comparison to the prior years  our risk with regard to fluctuations in interest rates has decreased related to the use of debt because there is no outstanding balance on our line of credit  but has increased with regards to our marketable securities due to the increase in outstanding balances 
commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to almond production and crop production 
the farming costs inventoried are recorded as actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are often recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december    is at risk to changing prices 
of the amount at risk to changing prices   is attributable to almonds   to pistachios  and  to walnuts 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds   related to pistachios  and  to walnuts 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every 
change in the price of almonds  our receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  so for each 
change in the price of pistachios  our receivable increases or decreases by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been to 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for walnuts was 
per pound 
for every 
change in the price of walnuts  our receivable increases or decreases by  the final price for walnuts has averaged from 
to 
over the last three years
