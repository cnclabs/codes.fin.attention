general we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
our fiscal years are as follows fiscal year number fiscal year ending of weeks december  december  december  december  our revenues are generated from three primary sources o company restaurant sales food and beverage sales o franchise royalties and fees o other franchise income beverage sales consist of sales of alcoholic beverages  while non alcoholic beverages are included in food sales 
franchise royalties are generally of each franchise restaurant s monthly gross sales 
franchise fees typically range from  to  for each restaurant opened 
other franchise income includes insurance premiums for the current year and premium audit adjustments for prior years from franchisee participation in our captive insurance program and revenue from information technology products and services provided to certain franchisees 
in  we reduced the types of insurance coverage plans offered which resulted in fewer franchisee participants in our captive insurance program 
this reduction resulted in a total decrease in franchise premiums recognized throughout in other franchise income of approximately  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to discontinue writing any new coverage 
we will still operate the captive insurance subsidiary to resolve any claims that were incurred under this program from through certain expenses relate only to company operated restaurants

overview applebee s international  inc and our subsidiaries develop  franchise and operate casual dining restaurants under the name applebee s neighborhood grill bar  which is the largest casual dining concept in the world with over  system wide restaurants open as of december  the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and there are many factors that affect our profitability 
our industry is susceptible to changes in economic conditions  trends in lifestyles  fluctuating costs  government regulation  availability of resources and consumer perceptions 
when evaluating and assessing our financial performance  we believe there are five key factors o development the number of new company and franchise restaurants opened during the period 
as the largest casual dining concept in the world  applebee s has a unique opportunity to leverage our brand  system size and scale to optimize our future growth 
our expansion strategy has been to cluster restaurants in targeted markets  thereby increasing consumer awareness and convenience  and enabling us to take advantage of operational  distribution and advertising efficiencies 
we currently expect that the applebee s system will encompass at least  restaurants in the united states  as well as the potential for at least  restaurants internationally 
in  we and our franchisees opened and restaurants  respectively 
together  we have opened at least restaurants system wide each year for the past fiscal years 
in  we currently expect to open approximately restaurants system wide  comprised of approximately company and franchise restaurants 
development costs increased approximately in as compared to further increases are expected in as a result of increased demand for material and labor due to recent catastrophic hurricanes 
we are evaluating the impact of rising development costs on the pipeline of future openings 
o comparable restaurant sales a year over year comparison of sales for restaurants open at least months 
our revenues are generated primarily from company restaurant sales  franchise royalties and fees and other franchise income 
increases in company and franchise comparable restaurant sales will result in increases in company restaurant sales and franchise fees and royalties 
in  company comparable sales decreased while franchise and system wide comparable sales increased and  respectively 
we have had consecutive quarters of positive system wide comparable sales growth 
we currently expect system wide comparable sales for to increase by to 
comparable restaurant sales increases are driven by increases in the average guest check and or increases in guest traffic 
average guest check increases result from menu price increases and or a change in menu mix 
although we may have increases in our average guest check from period to period  our main focus has been increasing guest traffic as we view this component to be more indicative of the long term health of the applebee s brand 
we are constantly seeking to increase guest traffic by focusing on operations and improving our menu with new food offerings and the implementation of programs such as carside to go tm and weight watchers tm 
in  we conducted comprehensive consumer research which resulted in a plan to substantially improve the quality and flavor profile of our food offerings over the next two years 
these menu improvements will impact all sections of our menu 
o company restaurant margin company restaurant sales  less food and beverage  labor  direct and occupancy restaurant costs and pre opening expenses  expressed as a percentage of company restaurant sales 
company restaurant margins were  and in  and  respectively 
we currently expect company restaurant margins  which will be dependent on comparable sales performance at company restaurants  to be similar to results 
company restaurant margins are susceptible to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor costs and other operating costs such as utilities 
we attempt to negotiate contracts for the majority of our food products in order to mitigate the impact of rising commodity costs 
in  we currently expect net commodity costs to decrease by approximately  including the negative impact of fuel surcharges 
in addition  we are uncertain what impact the improved menu offerings will have on our food costs  and we may take additional menu price increases to offset this impact 
we expect labor costs to continue to be negatively impacted by health insurance costs and the impact of wage rate increases 
in addition  higher energy costs  including utilities  fuel surcharges and packaging costs  will have a negative impact on company restaurant margins  particularly in the first quarter of o general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of total operating revenues 
general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
in  general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues are currently expected to be in the high range  excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense 
o return on equity net earnings expressed as a percent of average stockholders equity 
we believe this is an important indicator as it allows us to evaluate our ability to create value for our shareholders 
we have exceeded our stated goal of at least return on equity for the past seven years and we are a leader in the casual dining industry in this category 
application of critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies involve a significant degree of judgment or complexity 
inventory valuation we state inventories at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
market is determined based upon our estimates of the net realizable value 
we purchase and maintain inventories of certain specialty products to ensure sufficient supplies to the system  to ensure continuity of supply and to control food costs 
we review and make quality control inspections of our inventories to determine obsolescence on an ongoing basis 
these reviews require management to make certain estimates and judgments regarding projected usage which may change in the future and may require us to record an inventory impairment 
property and equipment we report property and equipment at historical cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related asset 
the useful lives of the assets are based upon management s expectations 
we periodically review the assets for changes in circumstances which may impact their useful lives 
if there are changes in circumstances that revise an asset s useful life  we will adjust the depreciation expense accordingly for that asset in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review restaurant property and equipment for impairment on a restaurant by restaurant basis using certain market and restaurant operating indicators including historical cash flows as well as current estimates of future cash flows and or appraisals 
we review other long lived assets at least annually and when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability is assessed in most instances by comparing the carrying value to its undiscounted cash flows 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
income taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets do not include future tax benefits that we deem likely not to be realized 
we are periodically audited by foreign and domestic tax authorities for both income and sales and use taxes 
we record accruals when we determine it is probable that we have an exposure in a matter relating to an audit 
the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
legal and insurance reserves we are periodically involved in various legal actions 
we are required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of loss 
we determine the required accruals after a review of the facts of each legal action 
we use estimates in the determination of the appropriate liabilities for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
the estimated liability is established based upon historical claims data and third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
unanticipated changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates 
we periodically reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
a change in any of the above estimates could impact our consolidated statements of earnings and the related asset or liability recorded in our consolidated balance sheets would be adjusted accordingly 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
acquisitions all of our acquisitions discussed below have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  our consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations for each acquisition subsequent to the date of acquisition 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at estimates of fair value as determined by management based upon information available 
we finalize the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed when we obtain information sufficient to complete the allocation  but in each case  no longer than one year after the acquisition date 
in march  we acquired the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in illinois  indiana  kentucky and missouri for  in cash and  in assumed debt 
the total cash payment included  paid at closing  approximately  paid as a deposit in and approximately  paid in the second quarter of in april  we completed the acquisition of the operations and assets of applebee s restaurants located in southern california for approximately  in cash

disposition on july   we completed the sale of eight company restaurants in the atlanta  georgia market to an affiliate of an existing franchisee for  in connection with the sale of these restaurants  we closed one restaurant in the atlanta market in june this transaction did not have a significant impact on our net earnings for actual company restaurant sales included in our consolidated financial statements for the nine restaurants were approximately  for captive insurance subsidiary in  we formed neighborhood insurance  inc  a vermont corporation and a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary to provide applebee s international  inc and qualified franchisees with workers compensation and general liability insurance 
applebee s international  inc and covered franchisees make premium payments to the captive insurance company which pays administrative fees and insurance claims  subject to individual and aggregate maximum claim limits under the captive insurance company s reinsurance policies 
franchisee premium amounts billed by the captive insurance company are established based upon third party actuarial estimates of settlement costs for incurred and anticipated claims and administrative fees 
the franchisee premiums are included in other franchise income ratably over the policy year 
the related offsetting expenses are included in cost of other franchise income 
we do not expect franchisee participation in the captive insurance company to have a material impact on our net earnings 
in  we reduced the types of insurance coverage plans offered which resulted in fewer franchisee participants in our captive insurance program 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to discontinue writing any new coverage 
we will still operate the captive insurance subsidiary to resolve any claims that were incurred under this program from through our consolidated balance sheets include the following balances related to the captive insurance subsidiary o franchise premium receivables of approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively  included in receivables related to captive insurance subsidiary

comparable restaurant sales at company restaurants decreased by in weighted average weekly sales at company restaurants decreased from  in to  in these decreases were due  in part  to a reduction in guest traffic in as compared to due to the launch of our weight watchers tm menu system wide in may in addition  we experienced more significant guest count declines in kansas city  minnesota and new england where approximately of our company restaurants are located  which was consistent with industry trends in these markets

because we expect to continue to purchase a portion of our restaurant sites  the amount of actual capital expenditures will be dependent upon  among other things  the proportion of leased versus owned properties 
if we construct more or fewer restaurants than we currently anticipate or acquire additional restaurants  our capital requirements will increase or decrease accordingly

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even if the timing and or settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of an entity 
accordingly  the entity must record a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have entered into certain leases which may require us to return the property to the landlord in its original condition
