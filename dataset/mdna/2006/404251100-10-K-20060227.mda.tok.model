the corporation purchases raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers  and generally most items are available from multiple sources 
major raw materials and components include coil steel  bar stock  castings  lumber  veneer  particleboard  fabric  paint  lacquer  hardware  plastic products  and shipping cartons 
since its inception  the corporation has focused on making its manufacturing facilities and processes more flexible while at the same time reducing costs and improving product quality 
in  the corporation adopted the principles of rci  which focus on developing flexible and efficient design  manufacturing and administrative processes that remove excess cost 
to achieve flexibility and attain efficiency goals  the corporation has adopted a variety of production techniques  including cellular manufacturing  focused factories  just in time inventory management  value engineering  business simplification  and principles 
the application of rci has increased productivity by reducing set up and processing times  square footage  inventory levels  product costs  and delivery times  while improving quality and enhancing member safety 
the corporation s rci process involves production and administrative employees  management  customers  and suppliers 
the corporation has facilitators  coaches  and consultants dedicated to the rci process and strives to involve all members in the rci process 
in addition  the corporation has organized a group that designs  fabricates  tests  and installs proprietary manufacturing equipment 
manufacturing also plays a key role in the corporation s concurrent product development process that primarily seeks to design new products for ease of manufacturability 
product development the corporation s product development efforts are primarily focused on developing end user solutions that are relevant and differentiated and focused on quality  aesthetics  style  and on reducing manufacturing costs 
the corporation accomplishes this through improving existing products  extending product lines  applying ergonomic research  improving manufacturing processes  applying alternative materials  and providing engineering support and training to its operating units 
the corporation conducts its product development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit level 
at the corporate level  the staff at the corporation s stanley m 
howe technical center  working in conjunction with operating staff  seeks breakthrough developments in product design  manufacturability  and materials usage 
at the operating unit level  development efforts are focused on achieving improvements in product features and manufacturing processes 
the corporation invested approximately million  million  and million in product development during fiscal years   and  respectively  and has budgeted in excess of million for product development in fiscal year intellectual property as of december   the corporation owned us and foreign patents and had applications pending for us and foreign patents 
in addition  the corporation holds us and foreign trademark registrations and has applications pending for us and foreign trademarks 
the corporation s principal office furniture products do not require frequent technical changes 
the majority of the corporation s office furniture patents are design patents which expire at various times depending on the patent s date of issuance 
the corporation believes that neither any individual office furniture patent nor the corporation s office furniture patents in the aggregate are material to the corporation s business as a whole 
the corporation s patents covering its hearth products protect various technical innovations and expire at various times  depending upon each patent s date of filing 
while the acquisition of patents reflects hearth home technologies inc s position in the market as an innovation leader  the corporation believes that neither any individual hearth product s patent nor the corporation s hearth patents in the aggregate are material to the corporation s business as a whole 
the corporation applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified  and the corporation believes that the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights 
the corporation also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others 
the corporation actively protects its trademarks that it believes have significant value 
sales and distribution customers in  the corporation s ten largest customers represented approximately of its consolidated net sales 
one customer  united stationers inc  accounted for approximately of the corporation s consolidated net sales in  and in and the substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the corporation can successfully offer its products 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the corporation will be able to maintain its customer relationships as consolidation of its customers occur 
the corporation today sells its office furniture products through five principal distribution channels 
the first channel  which consists of independent  local office furniture and office products dealers  specializes in the sale of a broad range of office furniture and office furniture systems to commercial  government  education  health care entities  and home office owners 
the second distribution channel comprises national office product distributors including office max incorporated  corporate express inc  a buhrmann company  office depot  inc  and staples  inc 
these distributors sell furniture along with office supplies through a national network of dealerships and sales offices which assist their customers with the evaluation of office space requirements  systems layout and product selection  and design and office solution services provided by professional designers 
all of these distributors  except for corporate express inc  also sell through retail office products superstores 
the third distribution channel  comprising corporate accounts  is where the corporation has the direct selling relationship with the end user 
installation is normally provided through a dealer 
the fourth distribution channel comprises wholesalers that serve as distributors of the corporation s products to independent dealers  national supply dealers  and superstores 
the corporation sells to the nation s largest wholesalers  united stationers inc and sp richards company  as well as to regional wholesalers 
wholesalers maintain inventory of standard product lines for resale to the various retailers 
they also special order products from the corporation in customer selected models and colors 
the corporation s wholesalers maintain warehouse locations throughout the united states  which enable the corporation to make its products available for rapid delivery to retailers anywhere in the country 
the fifth distribution channel comprises direct sales of the corporation s products to federal  state  and local government offices 
the corporation s office furniture sales force consists of regional sales managers  salespersons  and firms of independent manufacturers representatives who collectively provide national sales coverage 
sales managers and salespersons are compensated by a combination of salary and incentive bonus 
office products dealers  national wholesalers  and retailers market their products over the internet and through catalogs published periodically 
these catalogs are distributed to existing and potential customers 
the corporation believes that the inclusion of the corporation s product lines in customer catalogs and e business offers strong potential for increased sales of the listed product items due to the exposure provided 
the corporation also makes export sales through hni international to office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets 
distributors are principally located in latin america and the caribbean 
sales outside of the united states and canada represented approximately of net sales in fiscal limited quantities of select finished goods inventories built to order awaiting shipment are at the corporation s principal manufacturing plants and at its various distribution centers 
hearth home technologies inc sells its fireplace and stove products through dealers  distributors  and corporation owned distribution and retail outlets 
the corporation has a field sales organization of regional sales managers  salespersons  and firms of independent manufacturers representatives 
as of december   the corporation had an order backlog of approximately million which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the first few weeks of the current fiscal year 
this compares with million as of january   and million as of january  backlog  in terms of percentage of net sales  was   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the corporation s products are typically manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order 
the dollar amount of the corporation s order backlog is therefore not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the corporation s expected sales in any particular fiscal period 
for a discussion of the seasonal nature of the corporation s sales  see operating segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the corporation is one of the largest office furniture manufacturers in the world  and believes that it is the largest provider of furniture to small and medium sized workplaces 
the corporation is the largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces in north america 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a significant number of competitors offering similar products 
the corporation competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products and unsurpassed customer service 
the corporation competes with the large office furniture manufacturers  which control a substantial portion of the market share in the project oriented office furniture market  such as steelcase inc  haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  and knoll  inc 
the corporation also competes with a number of other office furniture manufacturers  including the global group a canadian company  kimball international  inc  ki  and teknion corporation a canadian company  as well as global importers 
the corporation faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will be able to compete successfully in its markets in the future 
hearth products  consisting of prefabricated fireplaces and related products  are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors 
the corporation competes primarily against other large manufacturers  including cfm corporation inc a canadian company and lennox international inc both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of performance  quality  price  complete and on time delivery to the customer  and customer service and support 
the corporation believes that it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance  superior customer service  and short lead times 
this is made possible  in part  by the corporation s significant on going investment in product development  highly efficient and low cost manufacturing operations  and an extensive distribution network 
for further discussion of the corporation s competitive situation  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
effects of inflation certain business costs may  from time to time  increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation 
the corporation s objective is to offset the effect of inflation on its costs primarily through productivity increases in combination with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit 
investments are routinely made in modernizing plants  equipment  support systems  and rci programs 
these investments collectively focus on business simplification and increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs 
ongoing cost control disciplines are also routinely employed 
in addition  the last in  first out lifo valuation method is used for most of the corporation s inventories  which ensures that changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income  and  more importantly  these costs are recognized in pricing decisions 
environmental the corporation is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges of air and water  the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials  and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
although the corporation believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business  there can be no assurance that requirements will not change in the future or that the corporation will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations 
the corporation has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental  health  and safety requirements 
the corporation s environmental professionals work with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility  the corporation s environmental legal counsel  and consultants on the management of environmental  health and safety issues 
the corporation s ultimate goal is to reduce and  when practical  eliminate the generation of environmental pollutants in its manufacturing processes 
compliance with federal  state  and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position of the corporation to date 
the corporation does not anticipate that financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal year for environmental control facilities 
it is management s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that new environmental legislation and technology in this area will not result in or require material capital expenditures 
business development the development of the corporation s business during the fiscal years ended december   january   and january   is discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows  and financial condition 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and  as a result  we may not always be successful 
both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive  with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products 
while competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations  typical factors for both industries include price  delivery and service  product design and features  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors  and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers  home builders and facility managers 
our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include the global group a canadian company  haworth  inc  kimball international  inc  steelcase inc  herman miller  inc  teknion corporation a canadian company  ki and knoll  inc our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include lennox international inc and cfm corporation a canadian compan y 
in both industries  most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders 
these competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products 
our continued success will depend on many things  including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality  high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries 
our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets 
in both the office furniture and hearth products industries  we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants primarily from lower cost countries 
such price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or  in some cases  even maintain prices  which could lower our profit margins 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures 
increased competition from low cost asian imports represents one of the most significant threats to our current market share in the office furniture industry 
in the hearth products industry  big box retailers  such as lowe s and home depot  with whom we currently do not do business  are increasing their penetration into the market 
if such market penetration continues  it could adversely affect our business  operatin g results  or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in our various markets in the future 
the concentration of our customer base  changes in demand and order patterns from our customers  particularly the top ten customers  as well as the increased purchasing power of such customers  could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we sell our products through multiple distribution channels 
these distribution channels have been consolidating in the past several years and may continue to consolidate in the future 
such consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers 
in  our ten largest customers represented approximately of consolidated net sales 
the increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products 
as a result of this consolidation  changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business  operating results  or financial condition than such events would have had prior to such consolidation 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our relationships with customers if this consolidation continues 
the growth in sales of private label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
private label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer  but manufactured by another party 
some of our largest customers have begun an aggressive private label initiative to increase sales of office furniture 
if these initiatives are successful  they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may  in some cases  even force us to lower prices  which could result in an adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
increases in basic commodity and raw material costs as well as disruptions to the supply of such basic commodities and raw materials could adversely affect our profitability 
fluctuations in the price  availability  and quality of the raw materials used by us in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales and our ability to meet the demand of customers 
the cost of steel  our largest raw material category  and other commodities have significantly increased in recent years due to  among other things  changes in global supply and demand  changes in laws and regulations including tariffs and duties  changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels  natural disasters  terrorism  and political unrest or instability 
these factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future 
our profit margins could be adversely affected if raw material and commodity costs remain high or escalate further  and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or  as a result of competitive market dynamics  unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers 
we are affected by the cost of energy  and increases in energy prices could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 
our gross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive to the cost of energy because the cost of energy is reflected in our transportation costs  the cost of petroleum based materials  like plastics  and the cost of operating our manufacturing facilities 
if the price of petroleum based products  the cost of operating our manufacturing facilities and our transportation costs continue to increase it could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 
we may not be successful in implementing and managing the risks inherent in our growth strategy 
as a part of our growth strategy  we seek to increase sales and market share by introducing new products  further enhancing our existing line of products  and continuing to pursue complementary acquisitions 
this strategy depends on our ability to increase sales through our existing customer network  principally dealers  wholesalers and retailers 
furthermore  the ability to effectuate and manage profitable growth will depend on our ability to contain costs  including costs associated with increased manufacturing  sales and marketing efforts  freight utilization  warehouse capacity  product development  and acquisition efforts 
our efforts to introduce new products that meet customer and workplace home requirements may not be successful  which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline 
to keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries  such as changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology  and with evolving regulatory and industry requirements  including environmental  health  safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance  we must periodically introduce new products 
the introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design  manufacturing  and marketing of such products  which may be affected by factors beyond our control 
the design and engineering of certain of our new products can take up to a year or more  and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance 
in addition  we may face difficulties in introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects  home builders and designers who are able to design  in a timely manner  high quality products consistent with our image 
accordingly  the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated by us 
difficulties or delays in introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline  and may result in an adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial co ndition 
we intend to grow our business through additional acquisitions  alliances  and joint venture arrangements  which could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
one of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions  alliances  and joint venture arrangements of businesses with technologies or products that complement or augment our existing products or distribution or add new products or distribution to our business 
in january  we announced the signing of an agreement to purchase lamex  a privately held chinese manufacturer and marketer of office furniture 
the benefits of an acquisition  alliance  or joint venture may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations  and we cannot guarantee that our lamex acquisition or any future acquisitions  alliances or joint ventures will in fact produce any benefits 
in addition  acquisitions  alliances  and joint ventures involve a number of risks  including diversion of management s attention  difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies  cost savings  and revenue synergies  potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models  reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices  which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy  inaccurate assessment of undisclosed  contingent  or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  and incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions  incurrence of non recurring charges  and write off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend  in part  on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price  our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates  and the availability of capital to complete such acquisitions 
these risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any such transactions with acceptable terms in the future 
if an acquisition is completed  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or that we will achieve sales and profitability that justify our investment in such businesses 
any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities 
the past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges in air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances 
compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material affect on our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position to date  however  compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future  stricter interpretation of existing laws  or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to make additional expenditures in the future  some of which may be material 
the existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors such as service sector employment levels  corporate profits  non residential fixed investment  and commercial construction 
industry factors  such as corporate restructuring  technology changes  corporate relocations  health and safety concerns  including ergonomic considerations  and the globalization of companies  also influence office furniture industry revenues 
hearth products industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well  including housing starts  overall employment levels  interest rates  consumer confidence  disposable income  changing demographics  and hearth industry revenues 
industry factors  such as technology changes  health and safety concerns and environmental regulation  including indoor air quality standards  also influence hearth products industry revenues 
there can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members 
healthcare costs have continued to rise over time and could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our inability to improve the quality capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of such dealers could adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
in both the officer furniture and hearth products industries  we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers 
we also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification  installation and after market services to our customers 
our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products  resulting in a decline in our sales  which may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our increasing international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the united states 
we primarily sell our products and report our financial results in us dollars  however we have increasingly been conducting business in countries outside the united states  which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of us dollars  which may affect our profits 
in the future  any foreign currency appreciation relative to the us dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency 
additionally  as we report currency in the us dollar  our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the us dollar 
we review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions 
we may be vulnerable to the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks  including  without limitation social and political turmoil  official corruption and civil unrest  restrictive government actions  such as the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds  changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire  retain or dismiss employees  the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations  preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition  less effective protection of intellectual property  unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region  and difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse affect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we may not be able to maintain our effective tax rate 
we may not be able to maintain our effective tax rate because income tax benefits may be offset by an increase in the valuation allowance due to the uncertainty regarding the ability to utilize the benefits in the future  the losses incurred in certain jurisdictions may not offset the tax expense in profitable jurisdictions  there are differences between foreign and us income tax rates  and many tax years are subject to audit by different tax jurisdictions  which audits may result in additional taxes payable 
restrictions imposed by the terms of our existing credit facility may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our existing credit facility limits our ability to finance operations  service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
specifically  our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets  engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us  sell  lease  license or dispose of any of our assets  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions  and enter into certain sale leaseback arrangements 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants 
our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  may permit acceleration of the indebtedness under the credit facility 
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms 
our capital requirements depend on many factors  including capital improvements  tooling  new product development  and acquisitions 
to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
our ability to generate cash depends on economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors that may be beyond our control

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the corporation s historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation and related notes 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the caption risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this report 
overview the corporation has two reportable core operating segments office furniture and hearth products 
the corporation is the second largest office furniture manufacturer in the world and the nation s leading manufacturer and marketer of gas and wood burning fireplaces 
the corporation utilizes its split and focus  decentralized business model to deliver value to its customers with its various brands and selling models 
the corporation is focused on growing its existing businesses while seeking out and developing new opportunities for growth 
during and  the office furniture industry experienced a rebound from the unprecedented three year decline it faced from to that positively impacted the corporation s office furniture segment 
the housing market remained strong during  which positively impacted the corporation s hearth segment 
during this rebound in the office furniture industry and strong housing market  the corporation continued its focus on business simplification and cost reduction as well as investing in growth initiatives to provide long term shareholder value

critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year end the corporation follows a week fiscal year which ends on the saturday nearest december fiscal year ended on december   ended on january   and ended on january  the financial statements for fiscal year are based on a week period and fiscal years and are on a week basis 
a week year occurs approximately every sixth year 
revenue recognition the corporation normally recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods to customers 
in certain circumstances  the corporation does not recognize revenue until the goods are received by the customer or upon installation and customer acceptance based on the terms of the sale agreement 
revenue includes freight charged to customers  related costs are included in selling and administrative expense 
rebates  discounts  and other marketing program expenses directly related to the sale are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
marketing program accruals require the use of management estimates and the consideration of contractual arrangements subject to interpretation 
customer sales that reach certain award levels can affect the amount of such estimates  and actual results could differ from these estimates 
future market conditions may require increased incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction in net sales at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on several factors  including overall customer credit quality  historical write off experience  and specific account analysis that projects the ultimate collectibility of the account 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the corporation to adjust the reserve level accordingly 
when the corporation determines that a customer is unlikely to pay  a charge is recorded to bad debt expense in the income statement and the allowance for doubtful accounts is increased 
when the corporation is certain the customer cannot pay  the receivable is written off by removing the accounts receivable amount and reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly 
as of december   there was approximately million in outstanding accounts receivable and million recorded in the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover potential future customer non payments 
however  if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of the corporation s large customers declares bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million at year end and inventory valuation the corporation valued of its inventory by the last in  first out lifo method at december  additionally  the corporation evaluates inventory reserves in terms of excess and obsolete exposure 
this evaluation includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels and ultimate product sales value 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the corporation to adjust the reserve level accordingly 
the corporation s reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million  and million at year end   and  respectively 
long lived assets the corporation reviews long lived assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the amount of the asset reflected in the corporation s balance sheet may not be recoverable 
the corporation compares an estimate of undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate group of assets  to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon the corporation s assumptions about future operating performance 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
asset impairment charges associated with the corporation s restructuring activities are discussed in the restructuring related charges note to the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
the corporation s continuous focus on improving the manufacturing process tends to increase the likelihood of assets being replaced  therefore  the corporation is constantly evaluating the expected useful lives of its equipment which can result in accelerated depreciation 
goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the corporation evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis based on values at the end of third quarter or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the corporation has evaluated its goodwill for impairment and has determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value  so no impairment of goodwill was recognized for the period ending december  goodwill of approximately million is shown on the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of fiscal management s assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today 
the corporation believes that its assumptions used in discounting future cash flows have no impact on the reported carrying amount of goodwill 
the estimated future cash flow for any reporting unit could be reduced by without decreasing the fair value to less than the carrying value 
the corporation also determines the fair value of indefinite lived trademarks on an annual basis or whenever indication of impairment exist 
the corporation has evaluated its trademarks for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of million in related to two trademarks where the carrying value exceeded the current fair market value 
the carrying value of the trademarks was approximately million at the end of fiscal self insured reserves the corporation is partially self insured for general  auto  and product liability  workers compensation  and certain employee health benefits 
the general  auto  product  and workers compensation liabilities are managed via a wholly owned insurance captive  the related liabilities are included in the accompanying financial statements 
the corporation s policy is to accrue amounts in accordance with the actuarially determined liabilities 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as number of claims  medical cost inflation  and magnitude of change in actual experience development could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
stock based compensation the corporation accounts for its stock option plan using accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which results in no charge to earnings when options are issued at fair market value 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation issued subsequent to apb no 
and amended by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock options using the intrinsic value based method described in apb no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
fas r  share based payment  effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the corporation plans to adopt fas r on january   the beginning of its fiscal year 
fas r eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in fas as originally issued 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the corporation has been disclosing in the notes in the consolidated financial statements the impact on net income and earnings per share had the fair value based method been adopted 
if the fair value method had been adopted  the corporation s net income for   and would have been reduced by approximatey million  million  and million  respectively  and earnings per share would have been reduced approximately  and per diluted share  respectively
