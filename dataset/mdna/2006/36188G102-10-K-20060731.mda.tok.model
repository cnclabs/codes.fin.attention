item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
gmh communities trust commenced operations on november   upon completion of its initial public offering and the simultaneous acquisition of the sole general partnership interest in gmh communities  lp  referred to throughout this report as our operating partnership 
the historical operations prior to completion of our initial public offering that are described in this report refer to the operations of college park management  inc  gmh military housing  llc  associates  lp  and corporate flight services  llc  which are collectively referred to  together with our operating partnership  as the gmh predecessor entities or our predecessor entities 
in connection with our formation transactions completed prior to and simultaneously with the completion of our initial public offering  the ownership interests in the gmh predecessor entities were contributed to our operating partnership as described in note of the financial statements included in this report 
we have described our operations in this report as if the historical operations of our predecessor entities were conducted by us for the full fiscal year ended december  overview we are a self advised  self managed  specialty housing company that focuses on providing housing to college and university students residing off campus and to members of the us military and their families 
as of december   we owned  or had ownership interests in  student housing properties containing a total of  units and  beds  one undeveloped parcel of land held for development as student housing properties and three partially developed parcels of land 
additionally  as of december   our operating partnership had an ownership interest in  and through various wholly owned subsidiaries provided services to  seven military housing privatization projects  and held rights to exclusively negotiate an additional project  comprising an aggregate of  end state housing units on military bases 
as of december   we also were in the solicitation process with the us air force for a military housing privatization project that is expected to cover four bases and  end state housing units 
on may   we officially closed on the award of the project that was under exclusive negotiation  comprising end state housing units located on the base of fort gordon located near augusta  georgia  and we acquired an ownership interest in the army s carlisle barracks and picatinny arsenal project  and assumed management and maintenance services for the project  which will cover end state units 
as of july   financing was secured for the carlisle picatinny project  and construction and renovation agreements were in the process of being completed to permit the commencement of construction renovation activities 
through our taxable reit subsidiaries  we provide development  construction  renovation and management services to our military housing privatization projects and property management services to student housing properties owned by others 
in addition  throughout  we provided consulting services with respect to the management of certain student housing properties owned by others  including colleges  universities  and other private owners 
in order to comply with the applicable requirements under the reit provisions of the code  we must limit the operations of taxable reit subsidiaries so that securities issued to us by our taxable reit subsidiaries do not represent more than of our total assets as of the close of any quarter in our taxable year and so that dividends from our taxable reit subsidiaries  together with our other non qualifying gross income  do not exceed of our gross income for any taxable year 
currently  our operations are managed within two operating segments student housing and military housing 
this structure provides an effective platform for maximizing market penetration and optimizing operating economies of scale 
in addition  we separately report the activities of certain departments from a corporate level  which includes personnel that service gmh communities trust as a whole and support our overall operations 
restatement of quarterly financial statements and identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as disclosed in the section entitled controls and procedures in part ii  item a of this report  in the first quarter of the audit committee of our board of trustees conducted an investigation of certain accounting and financial reporting matters 
the investigation identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and in our disclosure controls and procedures as of december  in connection with the investigation  we reviewed our previously reported financial statements 
through this review  we identified adjustments that were material to the results we previously reported for the quarterly periods ended march   june  and september  accordingly  we are restating our financial statements for those periods 
a summary of our restated operating results for each of the quarterly periods during is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements contained in the section entitled financial statements and supplementary data in part ii  item of this report 
these restatements and related information will be reflected in amendments to our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods during  or in our quarterly report on form q for the comparable period in student housing the student housing segment acquires  owns and manages off campus student housing properties strategically located near college or university campuses 
during the years ended december  and  our rental revenue increased substantially as a result of the acquisition of an aggregate of properties 
additionally  operating expenses  real estate taxes and depreciation and amortization have increased as a result of these acquisitions 
further  interest expense has increased related to the financing of the properties we have acquired 
historically  we have found certain property revenues and operating expenses to be cyclical in nature  and therefore not incurred ratably over the course of the year 
as our properties are leased predominantly on an academic year basis  certain of our operating revenues and expenses will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the leasing cycle 
for example  we experience significant turnover costs during the third quarter of our fiscal year  in connection with preparing our properties for new residents prior to commencement of the new academic year lease period  which typically begins in august or september 
in addition  we also typically incur higher lease up costs during the first two quarters of our fiscal year  as this is the period during which we heavily target students for leases that will commence for the next academic year 
property revenues and expenses may differ from expected results in the year of acquisition  depending on the timing of the acquisition in relation to the leasing cycle 
we expect this trend to continue as we acquire additional properties 
in comparing our operating statistics for the fiscal year versus  most of the key operating metrics for the student housing segment experienced significant increases  primarily as a result of i the presentation of a full year of operations during with respect to properties acquired in  and ii the acquisition of an additional properties during from to  rent and other property income  depreciation and amortization and interest expense generally increased five times  real estate taxes increased nearly six times  and property operating expense increased in excess of two and half times 
the increase in real estate taxes was disproportionately higher than the increase associated with rent and other property income due to more aggressive assessments by local taxing authorities with respect to certain of our student housing properties throughout the increase in property operating expenses was disproportionately lower than the increase associated with rent and other property income due primarily to timing issues surrounding the dates on which we acquired properties in in relation to the student housing leasing cycle 
operating expenses of our predecessor entities in for the period from january  through the date our operating partnership commenced operations amounted to million against which no property income was earned 
during  we also experienced  and expect to continue to experience going forward  increases in operating expenses in addition to the proportionate increase associated with the increased number of properties owned in versus that will include increased utility expenses resulting from national trends in higher energy related costs 
we earn management fees from managing properties for related parties and third parties 
these fees are typically equal to a percentage of cash receipts or gross rental revenues generated by the managed properties  or equal to a fixed monthly amount  according to the management agreements for the properties we manage 
we also have the ability to earn incentive management fees by achieving specified property level performance criteria for certain properties we manage for third parties 
further  certain operating expenses incurred related to properties we manage for others are reimbursed by the owners of the properties managed 
we expect to continue generating fee revenue and operating expense reimbursements from the properties that we manage for others  although the amounts are expected to become less significant as a percentage of our overall revenues as rental income increases from the properties we own 
during  we also expect to aggressively pursue new third party management agreements by utilizing relationships in the student housing market and providing our significant operational economies of scale as a savings mechanism for other third party owners  including institutional owners and individual student housing owners 
during  we expect to acquire additional student housing properties and development projects that are located in our targeted markets and that meet management s underwriting criteria for creating long term growth potential 
during  we entered into a joint venture with an institutional partner to develop and construct two student housing properties 
under the terms of this venture  our joint venture partner agreed to fund of the equity expected to be required for development of the properties  which includes acquisition costs for the properties and a portion of the development and construction costs  and we agreed to fund the remaining of the required equity 
the joint venture then obtained a construction loan for the properties to be developed that permits draws for up to a certain percentage of the total cost of development 
the terms of the joint venture provide that we manage the properties  including the development  construction and pre leasing of the properties  and have the option to purchase our partner s interest in the joint venture within one year after completion of the properties 
in an effort to conserve our capital resources  we expect  at least through the remainder of  to fund all future acquisitions of student housing properties and development projects primarily through joint venture structures 
we may also determine that it is appropriate to purchase additional student housing properties alone  as opposed to with a joint venture partner  depending upon many factors which may include  but are not limited to  the applicable purchase price  available capital and projected returns with respect to the property and availability of funds 
in addition to utilizing cash from operations and from our line of credit  we may leverage existing student housing properties which are underleveraged or unencumbered by debt to generate cash to fund the purchase of additional student housing properties or our equity investments in joint ventures 
the timing of any additional acquisitions or development projects will be dependent upon various factors  including our ability to complete satisfactory due diligence  find suitable joint venture partners and agree upon mutually acceptable joint venture terms  obtain appropriate debt financing on the properties  and the availability of capital 
military housing our military housing segment develops  constructs  renovates and manages military housing privatization projects in which we acquire equity interests 
our military housing segment began generating revenue in the fourth quarter of with the initiation of our fort carson and fort stewart and hunter army airfield projects 
revenue grew throughout and with the addition of various other projects 
revenue from our military housing segment is comprised primarily of fee income for providing development  construction renovation and management services to our military housing privatization projects 
in addition  we also are entitled to returns on the equity we invest in the projects 
in addition  we earn business development fees from certain of our business partners in connection with our military housing privatization projects  such as our construction and architectural engineering partners 
we seek these fees as payment for our business development efforts incurred by us in connection with pursuing and coordinating the completion of military housing privatization projects that benefit these business partners 
we also receive expense reimbursements  consisting primarily of payroll and related expenses  closing costs and transition costs we incur for the project in the to day period preceding the initiation of our management of the project 
typically  at the time we initiate management on a project  the project reimburses us for these amounts from the proceeds of the debt securities issued by the military housing privatization project 
as of december   we owned equity interests in the joint ventures that owned the seven military housing privatization projects in operation  encompassing military bases totaling  housing units 
during the year ended december   we earned fees for providing development  construction renovation and management services to these seven military housing privatization projects 
in may  the us department of the army selected us to be its private sector partner for the design  development  construction  renovation and management of family military housing units at fort gordon  located near augusta  georgia 
on may   we closed on the formal award of this project by the army and officially commenced operations on this project 
the project will have a six year initial development period with new construction and renovations of end state housing units 
the year project term will involve the development  management and construction of high quality homes  the targeted renovation of existing homes  and the addition of community enhancing facilities and services 
in addition  we are currently in the solicitation process with the air force for a military housing privatization project that is expected to cover four bases and  end state housing units 
in february  we entered into an agreement with american eagle communities northeast llc to obtain its rights to exclusively negotiate with the army with respect the carlisle picatinny project located in carlisle  pennsylvania and dover  new jersey 
on may   we acquired an ownership interest in the carlisle picatinny project and began management and maintenance services for this project 
as of july   financing was secured for the project  and construction and renovation agreements were in the process of being completed to permit the commencement of construction renovation activities 
this year project has a five year initial development period with new construction and or renovation of end state housing units 
we and the us department of the army continue to review the possibility of refinancing the fort carson project to obtain additional project funding 
if the project is refinanced  we would expect the proceeds to be used to fund development and construction renovation activities for additional housing units  for which we would expect to earn more fees in addition to the fees we currently earn for managing the existing housing units 
with regard to trends and uncertainties in the military housing market  some of the bases included in our military housing privatization projects were targeted for closure or realignment in the last round of the base realignment and closure  or brac  process  which was initiated in and completed its fifth  and under current legislation  final round in by way of background  the department of defense dod released its initial recommendations for brac in may  and the brac commission then voted to amend the dod s initial list on july  under the brac commission s revisions  several bases were removed from the dod s list of bases targeted for closure  including the submarine base in new london  ct and the portsmouth naval shipyard in kittery  maine 
in addition  the brac commission also proposed a less significant realignment at the fort eustis base under our fort eustis fort story project in newport news  virginia than was proposed by the dod  and the brac commission proposed to close the naval air station in brunswick  maine  which had been recommended by the dod to be realigned 
finally  the brac commission voted to uphold the dod s recommendation to close the walter reed army medical center in washington  dc 
in september  the brac commission sent its report to the president regarding its findings and recommended changes to the dod s initial report 
president bush accepted the brac commission s recommendations in their entirety 
on november   the brac round was completed when congress also approved the brac commission s recommendations in their entirety 
under the final brac list versus the original dod recommendations  the number of affected military housing units covered by our existing projects was reduced from  to approximately units  with these remaining approximately units located at the naval air station in brunswick  maine 
we believe that the closure of the walter reed army medical center will not result in the loss of housing units  as these housing units are likely to be utilized by personnel who will be relocated from serving at walter reed to serving at nearby military facilities in the washington  dc metropolitan area 
our management team also had under review  as of july   nine potential additional military housing privatization project opportunities  and will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire projects or project rights from our competitors  as well as opportunities to participate in pilot housing programs for unaccompanied military personnel 
for additional details with respect to these projects see the section titled military housing business additional military housing privatization projects and development opportunities under review located in part i  item of this report 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements and the gmh predecessor entities combined financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting principles may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate under the circumstances in which they were made 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
the following policies require significant judgments and estimates on our part in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements and the gmh predecessor entities combined financial statements 
changes in these judgments and estimates could have a material effect on these financial statements 
revenue recognition student housing student housing revenue includes rental revenue and other property income  standard and incentive management fees  and reimbursements of certain operating expenses 
these sources of revenue are described in greater detail below we recognize student housing rental revenue when due over the lease terms  which are generally months or less  we recognize other property income  including  but not limited to  lease processing fees  move in fees  and activity fees as earned throughout the course of the year 
the timing of these fees typically fluctuates in relation to the academic year leasing cycle  standard management fees are based on a percentage of monthly cash receipts or gross monthly rental and other revenues generated by the properties managed for others 
we recognize these fees on a monthly basis as the services are performed  we earn incentive management fees as a result of the achievement of certain operating performance criteria over a specified period by certain managed properties  including targeted annual debt service coverage ratios of the properties 
we recognize these fees at the amount that would be due under the contract if the contract was terminated on the balance sheet date  and expense reimbursements are comprised primarily of salary and related costs of certain of our employees working at certain properties we manage for others  the cost of which is reimbursed by the owners of the related properties 
we accrue operating expense reimbursements as the related expenses are incurred 
military housing we earn military housing revenues for providing services to our military housing privatization projects  including the following standard and incentive management fees based on a percentage of revenue generated by the military housing privatization projects from the basic allowance for housing provided by the government to service members  referred to as bah  are recognized when the revenue is earned by the military housing projects 
incentive management fees are based upon the satisfaction of certain criteria including  among other things  satisfying designated benchmarks relating to emergency work order responses  occupancy rates  home turnover and resident satisfaction surveys 
incentive management fees are recognized when the various criteria stipulated in the management contract have been satisfied 
standard and incentive development and construction renovation fees based on a percentage of development and construction renovation costs incurred by the military housing privatization projects  including hard and soft costs and financing costs  are recognized on a monthly basis as the costs are incurred by the military housing projects 
incentive development and construction renovation fees are based upon the satisfaction of certain criteria including  among other things  completing a number of housing units according to schedule  achieving specific safety records and implementing small business or minority subcontracting plans 
the incentive development and construction renovation fees are recognized when the various criteria stipulated in the contract have been satisfied 
in addition  in certain instances  we may receive fees relating to the performance of pre construction renovation services 
these pre construction renovation fees are determined on a project by project basis  and are paid in proportion to the amount of pre construction renovation costs incurred by us for the project 
these pre construction renovation fees are determined on a project by project basis  and are recognized as revenue upon performance of the pre construction renovation services 
revenues on fixed price renovation contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method 
when the percentage of completion method is used  contract revenue is recognized in the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to estimated costs at completion 
adjustments to cost estimates are made in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
when the revised estimates indicate a loss  such loss is provided for currently in its entirety 
business development fees are earned from our business partners that provide architectural and design or construction services for our military housing projects 
these fees are received in connection with pursuing and coordinating the completion of military housing projects 
the fees consist of i an annual base fee  which is a fee paid to the company in consideration of the company s ongoing pursuit of additional projects and is not contingent upon the success of those efforts and can be cancelled at any time  and ii an additional fee  which is paid over the course of an awarded project based on a percentage of revenue earned by these business partners for providing services to the military housing projects 
the base fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related business development agreement  which is generally one year 
the additional fee is recognized and paid to us as the related services are provided to our military housing projects by our business partners 
equity returns are earned on our investments in military housing projects 
during the initial development period for a project  the equity returns are a fixed percentage of our investment and subsequent to the initial development period for a project  the equity returns are based on a fixed percentage of our investment and on the project s net operating income  subject to cash distribution caps  as defined in the operating agreements related to the particular project 
as of december   only the fort carson project had passed its initial development period 
real estate investments and corporate assets we carry real estate investments and corporate assets at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
cost of acquired assets includes the purchase price and related closing costs 
we allocate the cost of real estate investments to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on relative fair values in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  business combinations 
we estimate fair value based on information obtained from a number of sources  including our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities  independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property  and other market data 
the value of in place leases is based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases and ii the property valued as if vacant 
as lease terms typically are months or less  actual rates on in place leases generally approximate market rental rates 
factors that we consider in the valuation of in place leases include an estimate of incremental carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and nature of the tenancy 
purchase prices of student housing properties to be acquired are not expected to be allocated to tenant relationships considering the terms of the leases and the expected levels of renewals 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases  which is generally one year or less 
we expense routine repair and maintenance costs that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life  including turnover costs 
we capitalize expenditures that improve the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is generally years for buildings including student housing properties and the commercial office building  and three to five years for residential furniture and appliances 
during the third quarter of each fiscal year  we typically will experience an increase in property operating expenses over other quarters as a result of repair and maintenance expenditures relating to turnover of units at student housing properties 
the company s student housing lease terms generally commence in august or september to coincide with the beginning of the academic year 
accordingly  the company expects to incur a majority of its repair and maintenance costs in the third quarter to prepare for new residents 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as real estate investments and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
these circumstances may include  but are not limited to  operational performance  market conditions and competition from other off campus properties and on campus housing  legal and environmental concerns  and results of appraisals or other information obtained as part of a financing or disposition strategy 
when required  we review the recoverability of assets to be held and used through a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset determined using customary valuation techniques  such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and no longer would be depreciated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the collectibility of receivables generated by rental and other income as a result of the operation of our student housing properties 
if we believe that the collectibility of certain amounts is questionable  we record a specific reserve for these amounts to reduce the amount outstanding to an amount we believe will be collectible and a reserve for all other accounts based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories  which is based on historical collection and write off experience 
we also evaluate the collectibility of fee income and expense reimbursements generated by the management of student housing properties owned by others and through the provision of development  construction  renovation and management services to our military housing privatization projects based upon the individual facts and circumstances  and record a reserve for specific amounts  if necessary 
minority interest minority interest as initially recorded at the date of our initial public offering represented the net equity of our operating partnership  including the proceeds received from the sale of the warrant to vornado  multiplied by the ownership percentage of holders of limited partnership units in our operating partnership other than the company 
our operating partnership is obligated to redeem  at the request of a holder  each unit of limited partnership interest for cash or common shares on a one for one basis  at the company s option  subject to adjustments for share splits  dividends  recapitalizations or similar events  except that gary m 
halloway  sr 
has the right to require our operating partnership to redeem his and his affiliates units of limited partnership interest for common shares  subject to his restriction from owning more than of the company s outstanding common shares 
if the minority interest unit holders share of a current year loss would cause the minority interest balance to be less than zero  the minority interest balance will be reported as zero unless there is an obligation of the minority interest unitholders to fund those losses 
any losses in excess of the minority interest will be charged against equity 
if future earnings materialize  equity will be credited for all earnings up to the amount of those losses previously absorbed 
distributions to limited partnership unit holders other than the company are recorded as a reduction to minority interest 
investments in military housing projects and student housing joint ventures military housing projects are joint ventures entered into between the company and the us military to design  develop  construct renovate and manage the military family housing located on or near various bases throughout the united states 
the company evaluates its investments in military housing project joint ventures in which we have a variable interest to determine if the underlying entity is a variable interest entity vie as defined under fasb financial interpretation no 
as revised fin r 
the company has concluded that each of the military housing project joint ventures in which it has a variable interest is a vie and that the company is not the primary beneficiary of any of these vies 
we record our investments in joint ventures under our military housing projects in accordance with the equity method of accounting 
our investment is initially recorded at cost  and then subsequently adjusted at each balance sheet date to an amount equal to what we would receive from the joint venture in the event that it were liquidated at net book value as of that date  and assuming that the proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with the terms of  and priority of returns set forth under  the joint venture s operating agreement 
the company has exposure to loss to the extent of its investments  if any  and any receivables due from the project 
the company entered into a joint venture in the third quarter of to develop and construct two student housing properties 
the company is accounting for the transaction as a financing arrangement because it has the option to purchase the joint venture partners interest in the joint venture within one year of completion of the properties and because the company has provided certain guarantees for the completion of construction and for a portion of the construction loans 
therefore  the company accounts for its investment in the joint venture by including its assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company elected to be taxed as a reit under the code commencing with its taxable year ended december  to continue to qualify as a reit  the company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of our adjusted taxable income to our shareholders 
we believe we are organized and operate in a manner that allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code  and it is our intention to adhere to these requirements and maintain the company s reit status in the future 
accordingly  no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  other than with respect to the company s taxable reit subsidiaries 
in conformity with the code and applicable state and local tax statutes  taxable income or loss of the gmh predecessor entities was required to be reported in the tax returns of gary m 
holloway  sr 
and vornado  as such entities were treated as pass through entities for tax purposes 
accordingly  no income tax provision has been reflected in the accompanying combined statements of operations of the gmh predecessor entities 
results of operations through  our student housing business focused primarily on providing property management services to related parties and others 
a number of the properties that we managed for others were disposed of by their owners  resulting in contraction in this segment of our business 
in  we redirected our focus in the student housing business and now are an owner operator of student housing in addition to being a provider of management services 
from to  we invested significant resources to pursue military housing privatization contracts 
we increased our planning  execution and management teams to address the needs of this segment 
while we were awarded numerous contracts  no income was recognized until the fourth quarter of as of december   seven military housing privatization projects are operational and this segment of our business is generating income 
the results of operations for the year ended december  presented below reflect the results of operations of the company 
the results of operations for the year ended december  presented below reflect the results of operations of our predecessor entities for the period from january  through november   and the results of operations for the company  after completion of our initial public offering  for the period from november  through december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  company company and predecessor entities student housing military housing corporate total student housing military housing corporate total dollars in thousands revenue rent and other property income   expense reimbursements related party     third party    management fees related party     third party    other fee income related party   other income total revenue     operating expenses property operating expense    reimbursed expenses     real estate taxes    administrative expenses   profits interest and employee initial public offering bonus expense depreciation and amortization   interest     total operating expenses     income loss before equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities  minority interest and income taxes    equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities  income loss before minority interest and income taxes  income taxes   income loss before minority interest    minority interest     net income loss      student housing revenue

expense reimbursements from related parties decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to our acquisition in march from related parties of two student housing properties that we managed prior to purchase 
in addition  in march  we ceased managing an additional student housing property owned by a related party upon the sale of the property 
expense reimbursements from third parties decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to our ceasing in to provide services to five student housing properties owned by third parties upon the sale of the properties 
although one of our business strategies for relates to the aggressive pursuit of new third party management agreements  we expect expense reimbursements from third parties to contribute less significantly as a percentage of overall revenue going forward  as a result of the continued growth in rental revenue that we expect to generate from the operations of properties we own and from the operations of new properties acquired throughout management fee income from related parties decreased to million in from million in the decrease in management fee income was primarily due to our acquisition in march from related parties of two student housing properties that we managed prior to purchase 
in addition  in march we ceased managing an additional student housing property owned by a related party upon the sale of the property 
management fee income from third parties decreased from million in to million in  which income included an increase of million related to our recognition of a one time management fee in that had not been previously recognized because it was deemed to be uncollectible and was paid to us upon the sale of the property by the third party owner  and which was partially offset by our ceasing to manage five student housing properties owned by third parties upon the sale of the properties 
although one of our business strategies for relates to the aggressive pursuit of new third party management agreements  we expect management fees to contribute less significantly as a percentage of overall revenue going forward  as a result of the continued growth in rental revenue that we expect to generate from the operations of properties we own and from the operations of new properties acquired during other fee income from related parties in was million compared to no other fee income in we anticipate that we will continue to generate such revenue during as a result of fees that we expect to earn from providing development and management services to joint ventures with third party institutional investors that we enter into to finance the development and construction of additional student housing properties 
other income increased slightly to  in from  in this other income consisted primarily of interest income on invested cash 
expenses 
property operating expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily due to expenses attributable to the properties acquired in and our ownership and operation throughout of properties acquired in property operating expenses also include compensation and operating costs with respect to our student housing department and acquisitions department employees 
we expect property operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we acquire additional properties 
with respect to properties that we currently own  we also expect to continue to experience increases in utility expenses resulting from national trends in higher energy related costs 
reimbursed expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to our acquisition from related parties in march of two student housing properties that we managed prior to our purchase 
in addition  during  we ceased providing management services relating to five student housing properties owned by third parties and a student housing property owned by a related party upon the sale of the properties 
real estate taxes increased to million in from million in primarily due to the acquisition of properties in and the full year of real estate taxes with respect to the properties we owned as of december  we expect real estate taxes to continue to increase significantly in the future as we acquire additional properties  and to the extent that local authorities continue to aggressively pursue higher real estate tax assessments on any properties that we currently own 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of acquiring properties in for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the million in is comprised of million of depreciation and million of lease intangible amortization 
we expect depreciation to increase significantly in the future as we acquire additional properties 
interest expense increased to million in from million in as a result of incurring additional debt  including placement of new mortgage debt and the assumption of existing mortgage debt  as well as borrowings under our line of credit  in connection with the acquisition of properties in during  we placed million of new mortgage debt  assumed million of existing mortgage debt  and increased borrowings under our line of credit by a net of million 
we expect interest expense to increase in the future as we incur additional debt to fund acquisitions 
interest expense also will increase as a result of rising interest rates

depreciation  relating primarily to our headquarters and corporate aircraft  of million for the year ended december  slightly increased from the year ended december  interest expense of million for the year ended december  slightly increased from million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses and other costs 
these expenses and costs include i recurring maintenance and capital expenditures to maintain and lease our properties  ii interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  iii real estate taxes and insurance  iv corporate salaries  employee benefits and other corporate overhead and administrative expenses  v equity contributions in connection with our military housing joint ventures  and vi distributions to shareholders and partners of our operating partnership 
our existing working capital and cash provided by operations  together with amounts available to us under our million revolving credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
availability under the credit facility as of december  was limited to a borrowing base amount equal to the sum of of the value of an unencumbered asset pool as of the end of the previous quarter which in no event may contain fewer than five student housing properties and of the annualized value of our cash flow from our management of military housing privatization projects and student housing properties in the previous quarter 
the credit facility was obtained by our operating partnership in november  and gmh communities trust serves as guarantor for the credit facility 
advances under the credit facility bear interest  at the election of the borrower  at a eurodollar rate based on libor or a base rate based on the prime rate announced by bank of america  na  as the administrative agent of the facility  plus an interest rate spread on both eurodollar and prime rate loans that varies depending upon the company s leverage ratio 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain certain corporate level financial covenants 
as of december  and april   we had availability under the credit facility equal to million  of which million and million  respectively  in borrowings was outstanding  and having a weighted average interest rate of as of december  and as of april  as of december  and april   there were no letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility 
in august  we entered into an amendment of the credit facility  under which the calculation of the borrowing base was revised to include cash flow from the military housing construction and development fees and to increase the total cash flow attributable to annualized fees from the management  construction and development of the military housing privatization projects and student housing properties from to 
the amendment also increased the applicable interest rate ranges on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility to the following to for eurodollar rate loans or to for prime rate loans 
the amendment also modified the calculation of the leverage ratio and increased the maximum leverage ratio from to through december  at the end of the first quarter of  the maximum leverage ratio reverted to 
in january  we paid a distribution to our shareholders that caused us to violate a covenant under our credit facility that restricted us from making distributions greater than of our funds from operations 
we received a waiver of this instance of noncompliance from our lenders 
we and the lenders also agreed to modify the covenant related to the payment of dividends to shareholders for the year ended december  under the terms of the modification  we were restricted from paying distributions to our shareholders with respect to in excess of of our funds from operations 
in january  we paid a dividend distribution to our shareholders that  when aggregated with distributions paid to shareholders during  exceeded this threshold for the year ended december  we also received a waiver of this instance of noncompliance with the financial covenant from our lenders 
as of january   the financial covenant restriction relating to these dividend payments reverted to the original terms under the credit facility  such that we are now restricted from paying aggregate distributions to our shareholders for any given year in excess of of our funds from operations for that year 
in addition  the credit facility also contains an affirmative covenant requiring us to provide audited financial statements within days after the end of each fiscal year  and unaudited quarterly financial statements within days after the end of each fiscal quarter 
as a result of the delay in the filing of this report and the filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   we obtained waivers of these covenants from the lender syndicate that permits us to deliver our audited financial statements for the fiscal year no later than august  as of june   we have paid fees totaling approximately  in connection with the above referenced waivers obtained during we elected to be treated as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders on an annual basis 
therefore  except as discussed below  as a general matter  a substantial portion of cash generated by our operations will be used to fund distributions to shareholders and holders of limited partnership interests in our operating partnership  and will not be available to satisfy our liquidity needs 
future dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual cash flow  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other such factors as our board of trustees deems relevant 
for the first quarter of  we declared a quarterly dividend distribution of per common share  payable to shareholders of record on march  we distributed this dividend on april   and at the same time  our operating partnership paid a distribution of per unit to holders of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership 
for the second quarter of  we declared a quarterly dividend distribution of per common share  payable on july  to shareholders of record on june  we cannot assure you that we will continue to have cash available for distributions at historical levels or at all 
any distributions we pay in the future will depend upon our actual results of operations  economic conditions and other factors that could differ materially from our current expectations 
we expect that during most of  our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to fund our anticipated dividend distributions 
therefore  we expect to rely on amounts available under our credit facility or through other third party debt financing to fund these distributions and other capital needs 
in addition  our ability to maintain our quarterly dividend payment at its current rate may be affected by the current restriction under the terms of our credit facility that preclude us from making distributions to our shareholders in excess of of funds from operations for the fiscal year 
our actual results of operations will be affected by a number of factors  including the revenue we receive from our student housing  revenues from management and consulting fees in connection with management services that we will provide for student housing properties owned by others  revenues from our military housing projects  our operating expenses  interest expense  legal and accounting costs related to the investigation of the audit committee of our board and related matters  costs related to our pending class action lawsuits and the activities of the special committee of our board  expenses in connection with the implementation of remedial measures to address the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  and any unanticipated expenditures 
for more information regarding risk factors that could materially adversely affect our actual results of operations  please see the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
our board may choose to pay a lower distribution in the event we are unable to obtain financing to pay our dividend at historical levels  or in order to assure compliance with applicable restrictive covenants on distributions under the terms of the credit facility 
as of december   of our student housing properties were encumbered by security interests relating to notes payable aggregating million and secured by first liens on the individual assets with an aggregate cost basis of approximately  million  before accumulated depreciation 
these notes payable had a weighted average interest rate of  mature at various dates between march and june and require monthly payments of principal and interest or monthly payments of interest only 
in addition  we had million in construction loan indebtedness outstanding that was secured by one of the student housing properties under development through a joint venture 
this indebtedness had a interest rate of  matures in  and requires monthly payments of interest only 
the table below sets forth for  the five succeeding years and thereafter the aggregate annual principal payments of the above referenced indebtedness dollars in thousands and thereafter  with regard to our military housing privatization projects  we are typically required to fund our portion of the equity commitment to the project s joint venture after all other sources of funding for the project have been expended 
with respect to our navy northeast region project  however  we were required to fund the equity commitment at commencement of the project 
we made a million equity contribution in november relating to our navy northeast project and  as of december   had contractually committed to contribute an aggregate of million in to our fort hamilton project  million in to our walter reed army medical center fort detrick project  million in for our fort eustis fort story project  million in for our fort stewart and hunter army airfield project  and million in for our fort bliss white sands project 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we contractually committed to contribute  in several phases that commence in and end in  an aggregate of million to our fort gordon project  and also to contribute million in equity to our carlisle picatinny project in these equity contributions help to fund the development  construction and renovation of housing units at these bases during their respective initial development periods 
typically  we are reimbursed for certain payroll expenses relating to the student housing properties we manage for third parties  for certain costs we incur after we are awarded the right to exclusively negotiate agreements for a military housing project until we enter into agreements for the project and for transition costs we incur shortly before initiation of our management of a military housing project 
however  we are required to fund these costs prior to the time we receive the reimbursements 
typically  army and navy projects require approximately million to million in costs associated with transition and exclusive negotiations  depending on the size of the project 
the expenditures typically begin months prior to executing an agreement for the military housing project 
accordingly  the timing between our payments and reimbursements for projects may add to our short term liquidity needs 
if cash flows from any of our military housing privatization projects are insufficient to meet the coverage ratios or benchmarks entitling us to receive fee payments  any unpaid fees will accumulate and be subsequently paid from operations or upon dissolution of the projects to the extent that funds are available and the applicable thresholds are met 
if these thresholds are not met  we will not have access to or receive certain of the fees we have earned 
the unavailability of these funds would materially impact our ability to meet our short term and long term liquidity needs 
we will be required to make equity contributions at the beginning of the initial development period for typical navy transactions and at the end of the initial development period for typical army transactions 
if cash flow is insufficient  any unpaid equity returns will accumulate as specified in the applicable project agreement and subsequently be paid from operations or upon dissolution of the projects to the extent the funds are available 
based on our current expectations regarding the terms of the debt funding for our military projects  we expect that the projects will generate sufficient cash flows to fund the reinvestment account and pay anticipated equity returns 
with regard to our currently owned student housing properties  we do not have any short term capital commitments  however  we will require funds in connection with our anticipated acquisitions of additional student housing properties 
during  we expect to acquire additional student housing properties and development projects that are located in our targeted markets and that meet management s underwriting criteria for creating long term growth potential 
in an effort to conserve our available capital resources for and potentially for sometime thereafter  we expect to fund the acquisition of many of our future student housing properties and development projects through joint venture structures similar to the joint venture terms that we entered into with respect to our orono  maine and bowling green  ohio development properties see disclosure appearing under the section titled business our recent activities student housing in part i  item of this report 
the timing of any additional acquisitions or development projects will be dependent upon various factors  including the ability to complete satisfactory due diligence  to find suitable joint venture partners and agree upon mutually acceptable joint venture terms  to obtain appropriate debt financing on the properties  and the availability of capital 
we intend to fund our equity portion of these joint ventures by using funds from our credit facility or from available cash from operations 
we also may determine that it is appropriate to purchase additional student housing properties alone  as opposed to with a joint venture partner  depending upon many factors which may include  but are not limited to  the applicable purchase price  available capital  and projected returns with respect to the property 
in addition to utilizing cash from operations and from our line of credit  we may leverage existing student housing properties which are underleveraged or unencumbered by debt to generate cash to fund the purchase of additional student housing properties or for other corporate purposes 
we expect that our primary source of funding for the equity associated with the acquisition of student housing properties and development projects during the next months  whether done through a joint venture structures or not  will be our credit facility and the placement of mortgage debt on the assets acquired 
depending upon the size of our student housing acquisition pipeline for the next months  the timing of closings on our properties  and the amount of cash required to fund planned student housing acquisitions  we may exceed the maximum capacity available under our existing credit facility 
in that event  we may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
while we believe we will be able to obtain such funds  these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  the outcome of the ongoing investigation by our audit committee  the outcome of our current litigation  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreement governing our credit facility 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
for the remainder of  we also expect to incur significant fees in connection with the investigation performed by the audit committee of our board and related matters  such as pending class action litigation  as well as the activities of the special committee of our board 
these fees primarily include additional legal and accounting expenses  as well as costs associated with implementing remedial measures to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that are described in more detail in part ii  item a of this report titled controls and procedures 
these fees will impact the level of cash from operations that we would otherwise expect to be available for the acquisition of additional student housing properties  and therefore could affect the number of acquisitions that we seek to complete during long term liquidity requirements with respect to our student housing and military housing segments consist primarily of amounts necessary to fund scheduled debt maturities  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  and the costs associated with acquisitions of student housing properties and awards or acquisitions of military housing privatization projects that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including existing working capital  cash provided by operations  long term mortgage indebtedness  equity offerings  and  with respect to fiscal year  owner contributions 
we now expect our long term liquidity requirements to be satisfied primarily through cash generated by operations that is not used to fund distributions and the additional external financing sources discussed above 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  as well as obligations under certain acquisition contracts we consider probable of completion as of december  for this year  the four succeeding years and thereafter  in the aggregate 
contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands notes payable      operating leases  acquisitions of properties  equity contribution     employment consulting agreements excludes individual contractual obligations with a value of less than  contractual obligations relating to our operations that may be terminated with notice of one month or less and contractual obligations for which we expect to be reimbursed 
represents scheduled payments of principal 
represents a ground lease with respect to one of our student housing properties 
the ground lease requires an annual rental payment of an estimated  for and ends on september   with the ability to renew for two additional five year terms 
the rental payment is subject to increases every five years  based on increases in the consumer price index cpi of at least 
the rental increases are based on an assumed cpi increase of every five years 
actual rental payments may vary from the amounts presented based on the actual cpi increases that are used to calculate the rent increases 
represents the contractual obligations to purchase seven student housing properties and an undeveloped parcel of land that we had under agreement of sale as of december  represents contractual commitments to fund equity contributions to military housing privatization projects 
does not include equity contributions that we are committed to fund for our fort gordon project in the amount of million  and the carlisle picatinny project in the amount of million 
we entered into agreements relating to these projects in the second quarter of we are subject to employment agreements with gary m 
holloway  sr 
and bruce f 
robinson 
as of december   joseph m 
coyle  the former president of our student housing business  resigned from the company 
as a result  mr 
coyle s previously effective employment agreement was terminated as of such date  and he and the company entered into a consulting agreement on january  with an initial term of months 
does not include employment agreements with three additional executive officers of the company that were entered into in july  each of which has a term of three years and which  collectively  cover the payment of an aggregate of  in base salary 
cash distribution policy commencing with our taxable year ended december   we filed a tax return electing to be treated as a reit under the code  and we expect to continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent that we distribute our reit taxable income to our shareholders  but the taxable income generated by our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to regular corporate income tax 
we intend to make at least the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualifications under the code 
holders of units of our limited partnership will also be entitled to distributions of cash equivalent to dividends per share paid to our common shareholders 
inflation as a majority of our student housing leases are months or less  rates on in place leases generally approximate market rental rates 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses may be offset to a certain extent by rent increases upon renewal 
a majority of our military housing management fees  construction renovation fees and business development fees are based on a percentage of revenue or expenses generated by us or the military housing privatization projects 
inflationary increases in expenses may not be offset by increases in revenue 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk given current market conditions  our strategy favors fixed rate  secured debt over variable rate debt to minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
as of december   of the outstanding principal amount of our notes payable secured by properties we owned had fixed interest rates with a weighted average rate of 
the remaining of outstanding principal amount of our notes payable and our line of credit  at december   had variable interest rates primarily equal to libor plus to 
as of december   we had million in funds drawn from our credit facility  bearing a variable interest rate at a eurodollar rate based on a day libor at and an applicable rate of  for a total interest rate of 
as of december   based on our variable rate debt balances described above  if interest rates were to increase by  our interest expense would increase by approximately million on an annual basis
