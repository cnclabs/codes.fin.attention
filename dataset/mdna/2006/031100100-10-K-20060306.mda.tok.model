revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale  under which title and risk of loss have been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
for a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery  we recognize revenue upon delivery to the customer  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
the policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
we have agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products 
the distributor purchases the product from the company at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor 
the company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts 
the company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized in the statement of income 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
at december   and  the accrual for future warranty obligations was million  million and million  respectively 
acquisitions primarily accounted for the increase in the company s expense for warranty obligations approximated million in and million each year in and the warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the company s operations  but for the most part do not exceed one year 
the company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience  and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses 
if actual future sales returns  allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience  additional warranty accruals may be required 
accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the company 
a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers 
for all other customers  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for possible losses on receivables was million at december  and 
table of contents inventories 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for approximately of its inventories 
the first in  first out fifo method  which approximates current replacement cost  is used to determine cost for the remainder 
for inventories where cost is determined by the lifo method  the excess of the fifo value over the lifo value was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand  market conditions  customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties  and related management initiatives 
if these factors are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
goodwill 
the company accounts for goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill is not amortized  rather  it is tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas requires a two step impairment test for goodwill 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the company s reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step must be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the company would be required to record such impairment losses 
the determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
changes in interest rates and market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates 
the company s acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and the company expects to continue to make acquisitions 
at december   goodwill totaled million or of the company s total assets 
the company performed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of and determined that the company s goodwill was not impaired 
there can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future 
pensions 
us defined benefit plans the company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans 
ametek accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the accounting requirements have no effect on funding of the pension plans 
the most significant elements in determining the company s pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
the pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the year end valuation date 
at the end of each year  the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
in estimating this rate for  the company considered rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rate used in determining the pension cost was for us defined benefit pension plans 
the discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at december   and determining the us defined benefit pension plan cost is 
in estimating this rate  the company s actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long term bonds at consistent maturity dates 
the company used an expected long term rate of return on plan assets for us defined benefit pension plans for of and will use an expected long term rate of for the company determines its expected long term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments 
additionally  the company considers historical returns on comparable fixed income investments and equity investments  and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate 
the rate of compensation increase used in determining the and pension expense for these plans was 
the unrecognized pension loss  which results from the net effect of changes in the assumed discount rate  the effect of differences between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets  and other changes in actuarial assumptions  has been deferred and is subject to 
table of contents amortization over the estimated service periods of the participants 
the unrecognized pension loss totaled million for us defined benefit pension plans at december   compared with million at december  depending on the impact of potential future changes in actuarial assumptions  the deferred loss could possibly affect future pension expense under current accounting rules

such expenses before customer reimbursement were million in  an increase from million in  and million in customer reimbursements were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
included in the amounts above are net expenses for research and development of million for  million for  and million for environmental matters certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations 
while these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time  the company has been named a potentially responsible party prp at non ametek owned sites 
the company is identified as a de minimis party in of these sites based on the low volume of relative waste attributed to the company 
in of these sites  the company has reached agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements 
the agreed to settlement amounts are fully reserved 
in the other four sites  the company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the site to establish an appropriate settlement amount 
in the six remaining sites where the company is a non de minimis prp  the company is participating in the investigation and or related required remediation as part of a prp group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the company s expected obligation 
the company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue 
in addition to these non ametek owned sites  the company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against the company with respect to other environmental matters once the company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable 
total environmental reserves at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company spent million on such environmental matters in and the company also has agreements with former owners of certain of its acquired businesses  as well as new owners of previously owned businesses 
under certain of the agreements  the former or new owners retained  or assumed and agreed to indemnify the company against  certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances 
the company and some of the other parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters 
to date  those parties have met their obligations in all material respects 
the company has no reason to believe that such third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future 
however  if the company were required to record a liability with respect to all  or a portion of  such matters on its balance sheet  the effect on income and the amount of the liability could be significant 
in the opinion of management  based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters  either adequate provision for probable costs has been made  or the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company 
market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates on its short term and long term debt  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices for certain raw material purchases
