this administration includes collection of withholding taxes  employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the united states  unemployment tax  workers compensation and fidelity and liability insurance  and other governmental requirements imposed on employers 
in most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required  including the united states  we provide health and life insurance  paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees

item a 
risk factors forward looking statements statements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
in addition  from time to time  we and our representatives may make statements that are forward looking 
all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
this section provides you with cautionary statements identifying  for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report or otherwise made by us or on our behalf 
you can identify these forward looking statements by forward looking words such as expect  anticipate  intend  plan  may  will  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward looking statements cost structure of subsidiaries  management turnover  reorganizations  material changes in the demand from larger customers  including customers with which we have national  multi national  or sole supplier arrangements  availability of workers with the skills required by customers  increases in the wages paid to our associates  competitive market pressures  including pricing pressures  inability to pass along direct cost increases to customers  changes in demand for our specialized services  including assisting companies in complying with the sarbanes oxley act legislation  and outplacement services  our ability to successfully expand into new markets or offer new service lines  our ability to successfully invest in and implement information systems  unanticipated technological changes  including obsolescence or impairment of information systems  changes in customer attitudes toward the use of staffing services  government  tax or regulatory policies adverse to the employment services industry  general economic conditions in domestic and international markets  interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations  difficulties related to acquisitions  including integrating the acquired companies and achieving the expected benefits  impairments to the carrying value of acquisitions and other investments resulting from poor financial performance  the risk factors disclosed below  and other factors that may be disclosed from time to time in our sec filings or otherwise 
some or all of these factors may be beyond our control 
we caution you that any forward looking statement reflects only our belief at the time the statement is made 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made 
risk factors any significant economic downturn could result in our customers using fewer temporary and contract workers  which would materially adversely affect our business 
because demand for recruitment services is sensitive to changes in the level of economic activity  our business may suffer during economic downturns 
as economic activity begins to slow down  companies tend to reduce their use of temporary and contract workers before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees  resulting in decreased demand for temporary and contract workers 
significant declines in demand  and thus in revenues  can result in expense de leveraging  which would result in lower profit levels 
the worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 
the worldwide employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry  and in recent years has been undergoing significant consolidation 
we compete in markets throughout north america  south america  europe  australia and asia with full service and specialized employment services agencies 
several of our competitors  including adecco sa  vedior sa  randstad holding sa and kelly services  inc  have very substantial marketing and financial resources 
price competition in the staffing industry is intense and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing 
we expect that the level of competition will remain high in the future  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability 
government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings 
in many jurisdictions in which we operate  such as france and germany  the employment services industry is heavily regulated 
for example  governmental regulations in germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our associates may be used 
in some countries  special taxes  fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates 
for example  our associates in france are entitled to a allowance for the uncertain duration of employment  which is eliminated if a full time position is offered to them within three days 
the countries in which we operate may  among other things create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide  require new or additional benefits be paid to our associates  require us to obtain additional licensing to provide staffing services  or increase taxes  such as sales or value added taxes  payable by the providers of temporary and contract recruitment services 
any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide staffing services 
our acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs 
we have completed a number of acquisitions 
for example  we acquired elan in for a total purchase price of million and we acquired jefferson wells in for a purchase price of million 
we acquired and invested in other companies during for a total consideration of million  million of which was paid in cash 
in  we acquired and invested in other companies for a total consideration of million 
in january  we acquired right management by means of an exchange offer for all of right management s outstanding common stock 
the purchase price for this acquisition was million  the majority of which represents the fair value of shares exchanged and stock options 
we acquired and invested in other companies in for a total consideration of million 
we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
our acquisition strategy involves significant risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services and corporate culture of acquired companies  over valuation by us of acquired companies  insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for legal liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions  and diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business 
in addition  future acquisitions could materially adversely effect our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity because they would likely result in the incurrence of additional debt or dilution  contingent liabilities  an increase in interest expense and amortization expenses related to separately identified intangible assets 
possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life  or restructuring charges could also occur 
intense competition may limit our ability to attract  train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients staffing needs 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients 
we must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing customer needs and emerging technologies 
competition for individuals with proven professional skills  particularly employees with accounting and technological skills  is intense  and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future 
qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us 
developing and implementing training programs requires significant expenditures and may not result in the trainees developing effective or adequate skills 
we may not be able to develop training programs to respond to our clients changing needs or retain associates who we have trained 
the failure to recruit  train and retain qualified associates could materially adversely affect our business because it may result in an inability to meet our clients needs 
we may be exposed to employment related claims and costs and other litigation that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses 
risks relating to these activities include claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our associates  claims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them  including claims relating to actions of our clients  claims related to the employment of illegal aliens or unlicensed personnel  payment of workers compensation claims and other similar claims  violations of wage and hour requirements  retroactive entitlement to employee benefits  errors and omissions of our associates  particularly in the case of professionals  such as accountants  and claims by our clients relating to our assoicates misuse of clients proprietary information  misappropriation of funds  other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims 
we may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems 
in addition  some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation  which could be time consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience these problems in the future or that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover any of these types of liabilities 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will cover all claims that may be asserted against us 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we lose our key personnel  then our business may suffer 
our operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management 
in addition  we are dependent on the performance and productivity of our local managers and field personnel 
our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered 
the loss of those key officers and members of executive management who have acquired significant experience in operating an employment services company on an international level may cause a significant disruption to our business 
moreover  the loss of our key managers and field personnel may jeopardize existing client relationships with businesses that continue to use our services based upon past relationships with these local managers and field personnel 
the loss of such key personnel could materially adversely affect our operations  because it may result in an inability to establish and maintain client relationships and otherwise operate our business 
some of our subsidiaries might have significant clients  which if lost  could have a material adverse impact on their earnings 
jefferson wells is a global professional services provider of internal controls  tax operations and finance operations services  with operations in the united states  canada and europe 
approximately and of jefferson wells revenues for and  respectively  were generated from providing services to one client 
should this client s demand for our services decrease  this would negatively impact our jefferson wells segment and overall profitability for us as a whole 
foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we conduct our operations in countries and territories and the results of our local operations are reported in the applicable foreign currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable foreign currency exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
during  approximately of our revenues were generated outside of the united states  the majority of which were generated in europe 
furthermore  approximately million of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  was denominated in foreign currencies 
because of devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into us dollars  we are subject to currency translation exposure on the profits of our operations  in addition to economic exposure 
this exposure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations in the future because  among other things  it could cause our reported revenues and profitability to decline or debt levels and interest expense to increase 
as of december   we had million of total debt 
this level of debt could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors  including the following we will have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for our operations  we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital  capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing  some or all of the debt under our current or future revolving credit facilities may be at a variable interest rate  making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates  we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities  such as acquisition opportunities  and to react to changes in market or industry conditions  we will be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and we may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage 
the terms of our revolving credit facility permit additional borrowings  subject to certain conditions 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks we now face could intensify 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses  to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to repay our other debt primarily from our operations 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we are not able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
the money we earn may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and to meet our other debt obligations 
if we do not have enough money  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow additional funds 
we may not be able to take such actions on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  the terms of our existing or future debt agreements  including the revolving credit facilities and our indentures  may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations 
our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date 
if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates 
the performance of our subsidiaries may vary  negatively affecting our ability to service our debt 
since we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries  our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings  or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to us 
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions  depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and be subject to various business considerations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the fiscal year ended december   the prices of our common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange ranged from a high of to a low of 
our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including factors listed in these risk factors and others  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcement of new services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  and changes in general economic conditions 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our shareholders or of securities analysts  and our stock price could decline as a result 
wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of us more difficult 
certain provisions of wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
these provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  permitting removal of directors only for cause  providing that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office  and requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees 
in addition  the wisconsin control share acquisition statute and wisconsin s fair price and business combination provisions limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances 
these provisions and other provisions of wisconsin law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 
as a result  offers to acquire us  which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock  may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized 
the provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline
