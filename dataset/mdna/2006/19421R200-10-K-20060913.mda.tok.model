item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in part ii of this annual report 
this discussion also should be read in conjunction with the information in item ia of part i of this report  entitled risk factors  which contains information about certain risks and uncertainties that can affect our business and our financial performance in the future 
introduction and overview our business collectors universe inc the company provides authentication and grading services to dealers and collectors of high value coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps  and vintage us currency notes which we refer to generically as collectibles and to sellers and purchasers of diamonds and colored gemstones 
we believe that our authentication and grading services add value to these collectibles and to diamonds and colored gemstones by enhancing their marketability and  thereby  providing increased liquidity to the dealers  collectors and consumers that own and buy and sell them 
we principally generate revenues from the fees paid for our authentication and grading services 
to a much lesser extent  we generate revenues from the sale of advertising on our websites  the sale of printed publications and collectibles price guides and advertising in such publications  and the sale of historical data and information about the collectibles authenticated and graded by us that we believe facilitates commerce in those collectibles 
on july   the company purchased substantially all the assets of coinfacts 
com  which operates an internet website on which it publishes detailed proprietary information and history on us coins 
on september   the company acquired the common stock of certified coin exchange cce  which operates a subscription based dealer to dealer internet bid ask market for third party certified coins 
on november   the company acquired gem certification appraisal lab gcal  a forensic gemological certification and grading laboratory 
as part of that transaction  the company also acquired diamond profile laboratory  inc dpl  a scientific diamond light performance analysis laboratory  and all publishing and other rights to palmieri s market monitor  an educational and informative industry publication currently published by the gemological appraisal association  inc gaa 
the company paid an aggregate acquisition price of  in cash for gcal  dpl and the publishing and other rights to palmieri s market monitor  and assumed certain transaction related costs of  on december   the company acquired the business and substantially all of the assets of gemprint corporation gemprint  consisting primarily of a patented technology for non invasive diamond identification which gemprint uses to digitally capture the unique refractive light pattern or gemprint of each diamond that is processed with that technology 
the company paid a purchase price for gemprint s business and assets of  in cash  and assumed certain pre acquisition liabilities and lease commitments  and agreed to pay additional contingent purchase price of for each diamond that the company registers using the gemprint process in excess of  registrations per year during the five year period ending december  gcal has incorporated the gemprint process into its diamond grading process  so that each gcal authenticated and graded diamond also carries a gemprint image stored in gcal s registered database  which enables gcal to provide an additional measure of protection against misrepresentations of diamond quality that can occur by  for example  switching a diamond grading certificate issued for a higher quality diamond to a lower quality diamond 
the operating results of these acquired businesses have been consolidated into our operating results from the respective dates of their acquisition 
as previously reported  during the period from through the latter part of fiscal  we also were engaged in the business of marketing and selling collectible coins  sportscards and sports entertainment and historical memorabilia 
most of those sales were made at multi venue auctions that were conducted by our collectibles sales divisions 
we also sold collectible coins  at retail  by direct sales methods 
in december we adopted a plan to focus our financial and managerial resources and collectibles expertise on the operation and growth of our authentication and grading and other collectibles service businesses  and to divest our collectibles auctions and direct sales businesses 
pursuant to that plan  during fiscal we sold our collectibles auction businesses and terminated our direct sales collectible coins business 
however  we retained the collectibles inventories and the outstanding accounts receivables of those businesses  substantially all of which had been liquidated by june  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 the assets and related liabilities of the collectible sales businesses have been classified as held for sale and their related operating results have been classified as discontinued operations 
in connection with our acquisition of cce in september  we also acquired one of its affiliated companies ctp that was engaged in an unrelated business 
at the time we consummated the cce acquisition we intended to dispose of ctp and  effective november   we disposed of ctp 
accordingly  ctp has been classified as a discontinued business and its operating results for the period during fiscal year that we owned it  have been included in discontinued operations 
as a result of our divestiture of our collectibles auctions and sales businesses and the disposition of ctp  the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on our authentication and grading businesses  which comprise substantially all of our continuing operations 
factors that can affect our financial position and operating results factors that can affect our revenues and cash flows 
the provision of authentication and grading services has provided relatively stable and predictable cash flows for us  as the fees for a significant proportion of the authentication and grading submissions we receive are prepaid 
in the years ended june   and  respectively  we generated cash of   and  respectively  from the operations of our continuing businesses 
during the year ended june   and  we generated cash of   and  from the sales of our collectibles sales businesses and the liquidation of the retained inventories and accounts receivables of those businesses 
as a result  at june   the remaining assets of those businesses  which we are in the process of liquidating  totaled  as compared to  at june  therefore  it is not expected that the company will generate any substantial cash flows from the sale of the remaining assets of the discontinued businesses in the future 
during the year ended june   five of our coin authentication and grading customers accounted for approximately of our total net revenues 
as a result  the loss of any of those customers  or a decrease in the volume of grading submissions from any of them to us  would cause our net revenues to decline and  therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the owner of the largest of these customers encountered an unexpected and serious medical problem  which led to a decrease in revenues from that customer in fiscal  compared to fiscal the company s cash flows from investing activities can be impacted by the extent to which the company purchases new businesses  invests in capital expenditure and makes advances or receives repayments under the dealer financing program 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was cash flows from financing activities reflects dividends paid to common stockholders  payments for the retirement of the company s common stock authorized under the company s buyback program  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal was  at june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling  compared with  at june  factors affecting our gross profit margins 
our gross profit margins are primarily affected by the mix and the total number of units submitted to us for authentication and grading and the level of our non grading revenues 
the gross profit on our authentication and grading revenues is affected by the i mix of submission revenues among coins  sportscards and other collectibles  ii the mix of submission revenues between vintage or classic coins and sportscards  on the one hand  and modern coins and sportscards  on the other hand  since  as a general rule  customers request faster turn around times for vintage or classic coins and sportscards than they do for modern submissions  and iii in the case of coins and sportscards  the turn around times requested by our customers  because we charge higher fees for faster service times 
furthermore  because a significant proportion of our direct costs are relatively fixed in nature  our gross profit is also affected by the overall volume of collectibles authenticated and graded in any period 
impact of economic conditions on financial performance 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the collectibles and high value asset markets 
accordingly  our operating results are affected by the financial performance of those markets  which depends to a great extent on i discretionary consumer spending and  hence  on the availability of disposable income  ii on other economic conditions  including prevailing interest and inflation rates  which affect consumer confidence  and iii the performance and volatility of the precious metals and stock markets 
these conditions primarily affect the volume of purchases and sales of collectibles and high value assets which  in turn  affects the volume of authentication and grading submissions to us  because our services facilitate commerce in collectibles  diamonds and other high value assets 
accordingly  factors such as improving economic conditions which usually result in increases in disposable income and consumer confidence  and volatility in and declines in the prices of stocks and a weakening in the value of the us dollar  which lead investors to increase their purchases of precious metals  such as gold bullion  other coins  and other collectibles and high value assets  usually result in increases in submissions of collectibles for our services 
by contrast  the volume of collectibles and high end value asset sales and purchases and  therefore  the volume of authentication and grading submissions  usually decline during periods characterized by recessionary economic conditions and by declines in disposable income and consumer confidence or by increasing stock prices and relative stability in the stock markets 
the following table provides information regarding the respective numbers of coins  sportscards  autographs  stamps  currency notes and diamonds that we graded or authenticated in the fiscal years ended june    and and their estimated values  which are the amounts at which those coins  sportscards  stamps  currency and diamonds were insured by the dealers  collectors and consumers who submitted them to us for grading and authentication

overview of fiscal operating results as the following table indicates  operating income decreased by in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  despite a increase in revenues  due primarily to the combined effects of an increase in costs of revenues  a decline in our gross profit margin  and an increase in selling  general and administrate expenses 
income from continuing operations decreased by  primarily as a result of the above factors that impacted operating income partially offset by increased interest income earned in fiscal  but inclusive of a higher income tax rate due to stock based compensation

the increase in costs of revenue in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in coin grader related compensation costs and the recognition  pursuant to sfas no 
r  of  of stock based compensation cost 
stock based compensation was not required to be recognized as an expense in years prior to fiscal the decline in our gross margin in fiscal was due primarily to i those increases in costs of revenues ii a change in the mix of collectibles and high value assets graded to a lower proportion of coins  on which we realize higher margins than on authentication and grading of other collectibles  and iii a decline in the average service price for coin authentication and grading services due to the mix of services provided in as compared to the increase in selling and marketing costs in fiscal was primarily due to i costs of approximately  related to the promotion and marketing of our new businesses  and ii increased collectibles trade show expenses and advertising expenses  due primarily to an increase in the number of collectibles trade shows in which we participated in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to expenses incurred in connection with i the acquisition and integration into our operations of newly acquired businesses  ii investments in infrastructure to support our expanded operations  iii audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs  iv stock based compensation costs arising from the adoption of sfas r at the beginning of fiscal  and v litigation costs 
see more detailed discussion of results of operations on pages to critical accounting policies and estimates general 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in determining the fair value of certain of our assets  principally accounts receivable and inventories  we must make judgments  and estimates and assumptions  regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our accounts receivable or realize the value of our inventories in future periods 
those judgments  estimates  and assumptions are based on current information available to us at that time 
many of those conditions  trends and circumstances  however  are outside of our control and  if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other or circumstances on which are judgments or estimates were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates 
changes in such estimates may require that we reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet which are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets involved 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances to record such downward adjustments or write downs in the carrying value of assets such as accounts and notes receivable and inventory 
such write downs are recorded as charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those reserves or allowances are established or increased to take account of changed conditions or events 
as a result  our judgments  estimates and assumptions about future events and changes in the conditions  events or trends upon which those estimates and judgments were made  can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record such assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of adjustments or write downs of this nature also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of events or changes in circumstances 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events  such as occurred on september  or increases in interest rates or economic slowdowns  will have short or longer term consequences for our business  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the occurrence of an event or the onset of changes in economic circumstances for the full effects of such events or changes to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which  and also regarding the amounts at which  sales are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on a number of factors  including whether customers are granted rights to reject or adjust the payment for the services provided to them 
as is described above  during fiscal year we acquired certain businesses and  in accordance with gaap  we accounted for those acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
that accounting method required us to allocate the amount paid for those businesses over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  and to classify the excess of the purchase price over that fair value as goodwill 
in accordance with gaap  we will be evaluating goodwill for impairments at least annually  or more frequently if we believe that goodwill has been impaired in the interim due to changing facts or events see long lived assets below 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have definite lives are subject to amortization over their remaining useful lives 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to on going evaluation for impairment 
management intends to formally evaluate the carrying value of its goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on the anniversary date of each of the acquisitions that gave rise to the recording of such assets 
in making our estimates and assumptions  we follow gaap in order to enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the fair value of assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for possible write downs in the carrying values of our assets 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies and critical estimates that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition policies 
we generally record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible or diamond to the customer 
our authentication and grading customers generally prepay our authentication and grading fees when they submit their collectible items to us for authentication and grading 
we record those prepayments as deferred revenue until their graded collectibles are shipped back to them 
at that time  we record the revenues from the authentication and grading services we have performed for the customer and deduct this amount from deferred revenue 
for certain dealers to whom we extend open account privileges  we record revenue at the time of shipment of the authenticated and graded collectible to the dealer 
accounts receivable  notes receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our authentication and grading business  we extend payment terms to many of the larger  more creditworthy dealers who submit collectibles or diamonds to us for authentication and grading on a recurring basis 
in addition  primarily in connection with our coin dealer financing programs  we make advances or extend credit under notes receivable arrangements 
we regularly review our accounts and notes receivable  estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts in each quarterly period 
the amount of that allowance is based on several factors  including the age and extent of significant past due amounts  and  in the case of notes receivable  the current value of the collateral we hold in support of the notes receivable  and known conditions or trends that may affect the ability of account debtors or note obligors to pay their accounts or notes receivable balances 
each quarter we review estimates of uncollectible amounts and such economic or other conditions or trends in order to enable us to determine whether or not to adjust the amount of the allowance 
for example  if the financial condition of certain dealers or economic conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments on their accounts or notes  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is created by recording a charge against income that is reflected in general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will cause a decline in our operating results in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory valuation reserve 
our collectibles inventories are valued at the lower of cost or fair value and have been reduced by an inventory valuation allowance to provide for potential declines in the value of those inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined and is periodically adjusted on the basis of market knowledge  historical experience and estimates concerning future economic conditions or trends that may impact the sale value of the collectibles inventories 
additionally  due to the relative uniqueness of some of the collectibles included in our collectibles inventory  valuation of such collectibles often involves judgments that are more subjective than those that are required when determining the market values of more standardized products 
if there were to be an economic downturn or there were to occur other events or circumstances that are likely to make it more difficult to sell  or that would lead us to reduce the sales prices of those collectibles  it may become necessary to increase the reserve 
increases in this reserve will cause a decline in operating results  because such increases are recorded by charges against income 
grading warranty costs 
we offer a limited warranty covering the coins  sportscards  stamps and currency that we authenticate and grade 
under the warranty  if any collectible that was previously authenticated and graded by us is later submitted to us for re grading and either i receives a lower grade upon that resubmittal or ii is determined not to have been authentic  we will offer to purchase the collectible or pay the difference in value of the item at its original grade as compared with its lower grade 
however  this warranty is voided if the collectible  upon resubmittal to us  is not in the same tamper resistant holder in which it was placed at the time we last graded it 
we offer a similar limited warranty  of one year s duration  on the diamonds we grade 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs based on historical trends and related experience 
to date our reserves have proved to be adequate 
however  if warranty claims were to increase in relation to historical trends and experience  we would be required to increase our warranty reserves and incur additional charges that would adversely affect our results of operations in those periods during which the warranty reserve is increased 
long lived assets 
we regularly conduct reviews of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill  for possible impairment 
such reviews occur annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in full 
in order to determine if the value of an asset is impaired  we make an estimate of the future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition and determine its fair value by discounting those cash flows to present value using a discount rate commensurate with management s estimates of the business risks associated with the asset 
if that estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value 
the company does not believe there was any impairment of its long lived assets as of june  there can be no assurance  however  that there will be no impairments of the company s long lived assets in the future 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we began recognizing share based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the black scholes option valuation method 
under that method  assumptions are made with respect to the expected lives of the options granted  the expected volatility of the company s stock  dividend yield percentage and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  we recognize and report share based compensation expense net of option forfeitures that we expect will occur over the vesting period  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect future forfeiture 
once we determine the compensation expense of a stock option award  that expense is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period of the option using the straight line attribution method 
capitalized software 
through june   we capitalized approximately  of software development costs in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires that certain costs incurred  either from internal or external sources  be capitalized as part of intangible assets and amortized on a straight line basis over the useful life of the software 
planning  training  support and maintenance costs incurred either prior to or following the implementation phase are recognized as expense in the period in which they occur 
during fiscal  approximately  was recorded as amortization expense 
the company evaluates the carrying values of capitalized software to determine if the carrying values are impaired  and  if necessary  an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  derived from our statements of operations for the respective periods indicated below fiscal years ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing expenses general administrative expenses settlement of lawsuit total operating expenses operating income interest income  net other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of gain on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes net income net revenues 
net revenues consist primarily of fees generated from the grading and authentication of sportscards  coins and stamps and  to a much lesser extent  the grading of diamonds  revenues from the sale of advertising  subscription based revenues  and the publication of collectibles magazines 
net revenues are determined net of discounts and allowances

coin grading revenues increased by  compared to a increase in the number of units graded  as a result of modern coins for which we earn a lower service fee representing a higher proportion of total coins graded in fiscal year  compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the continued success of the company s first strike program see below 
for sportcards  the increase in the number of units graded resulted in a increase in grading revenues reflecting a decrease in the average service fee due to a higher proportion of units graded at special pricing than in the prior year 
the increase in units graded and authenticated for other collectibles resulted in a increase in grading and authentication revenues  primarily reflecting a change in pricing in our autograph authentication services business that makes such services more attractive to a larger number of dealers and collectors 
the increase in the number of coins graded and authenticated in fiscal  as compared to the prior year  was primarily attributable to an increase in coin submissions under the company s first strike program which has expanded in into a third and fourth quarter program  as compared to only a third quarter program in fiscal 
these increases more than offset a reduction in the number of units submitted from a coin dealer that had been our largest customer until the fourth quarter of fiscal  when its owner sustained a serious illness 
revenues attributable to coin submissions by that customer declined from of total revenues in fiscal to of total revenues for fiscal although the company s growth in revenues in the current year has been depressed by the loss of coin revenues from that customer  we continue to believe that general economic conditions are favorable to our coin grading and other businesses as evidenced by unit increases of and  respectively  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year

also contributing to the increase in net revenues in were increases in sales of advertising and collectors club memberships totaling approximately  which includes an approximate  increase in on line advertising in  as compared to the average of the service fees earned for all collectibles was approximately the same in and however  revenues from modern coin submissions  on which we earn a lower average service fee than for vintage coin submissions  accounted for a higher proportion of the coins authenticated and graded in  than in as a result  in  the increase in the number of coins authenticated and graded was greater than the increase in the net revenues attributable to coin submissions 
gross profit 
gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of revenues from net revenues 
gross profit margin is gross profit stated as a percent of net revenues 
cost of authentication and grading revenues  primarily consist of labor to authenticate and grade collectibles  production costs  credit cards fees  warranty expense and occupancy  security and insurance costs that directly relate to providing authentication and grading services  and printing and other direct costs 
in fiscal year  our costs of revenues included stock based compensation  earned by employees in our authentication and grading division  which was required to be recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r  beginning in fiscal stock based compensation was not required to be recognized in fiscal years prior to fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands gross profit gross profit margin the decline in our gross profit margin from in to in fiscal year  was primarily attributable to i a modest decline in the average service fees for coins due to the mix of services provided in the periods  ii increased coin grader related compensation costs of  which is net of a  credit for the reversal of a long term compensation accrual for a former employer due to termination of his employment in fiscal year  as a result of an increase in the number of graders and the implementation of a more fixed rate compensation plan iii a change in the mix of collectibles and high value assets graded to a lower proportion of coins  on which we realize higher margins than on authentication and grading of other collectibles  and iv stock based compensation expense of  for fiscal year  recorded as required by sfas no 
r 
coin revenues represented approximately of total net revenues in fiscal  compared to approximately of total net revenues  in fiscal the increase in the gross profit margin in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to i increases of in coin authentication and grading revenues  on which we realize higher margins than on authentication and grading submissions of sportscards and other collectibles  ii the increases in net revenues described above  which caused the fixed elements of our costs of revenues to represent a lower percentage of total revenues than in  and iii increases  as compared to  in sales of website advertising  for which the cost of sales were minimal 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of advertising and promotions costs  trade show related expenses  customer service personnel costs and third party consulting costs 
fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues the increase of  in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year were primarily attributable to i costs of approximately  of which approximately  related to our diamond grading business  incurred in fiscal in connection with the launch of the company s currency grading division and the commencement of marketing programs for the businesses that we acquired in the first six months of fiscal year and the launch of the company s currency grading division  ii increased collectibles trade show expenses of approximately  incurred in fiscal due to the company participating in more trade shows in fiscal  and focusing more resources on our trade show programs at which we are able to generate higher average service fees due to the faster turnaround times demanded by dealers and collectors attending those shows  iii increased advertising and promotional expenses of approximately  incurred in fiscal  including promotional costs associated with the company s first strike program  and iv increases in personnel costs in our customer service departments 
the increase of  in selling and marketing expenses in  compared to  was primarily attributable to increases in general marketing expenses customer service personnel  advertising and trade show related costs in notwithstanding those increases  however  as a percentage of net revenues  selling and marketing expenses decreased from of net revenues in to in  indicating that we were able to increase authentication and grading revenues and sales of advertising without having to make commensurate increases in our selling and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses are comprised primarily of compensation paid to general and administrative personnel  including executive management  finance and accounting  information technology personnel  facilities management costs and other miscellaneous expenses 
in fiscal  g a expenses also included stock based compensation required to be recognized in accordance with sfas no 
r  effective july  fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands general administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues the increase in general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal were primarily attributable to general and administrative expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration in our operations of the newly acquired businesses  investment in infrastructure to support the growth of our businesses  litigation costs  audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs and stock based compensation costs arising from the adoption of sfas r 
the increased costs associated with the acquired businesses were approximately  which included business transition and intangible amortization costs of approximately  we also incurred approximately  in connection with the implementation of our business acquisition and expansion program in fiscal the increased infrastructure costs of approximately  in fiscal included investments in information technology systems and one time space related costs to support the growth of our businesses 
litigation costs were approximately  higher in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily attributable to the costs of the trial in the miller lawsuit that took place in the second quarter of fiscal increased audit  sarbanes oxley and tax compliance costs of approximately  were incurred primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal stock based compensation costs recognized pursuant to sfas r and included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  although  in  g a expenses increased by  as compared to  such expenses did not increase at the same rate as did net revenues  due primarily to improvements in operating efficiencies and staff reductions we were able to make as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses 
therefore  as a percentage of net revenues  g a expenses declined to in from for in dollar terms  the larger value components of the increases in g a expenses in  compared to  consisted primarily of i increases of approximately  in legal fees  including fees incurred on litigation matters  such as the real legends lawsuit discussed below  ii approximately  of costs incurred in connection with the launch of our new currency grading service during  iii consulting fees and audit costs of approximately  incurred in connection with the documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  iv new business development personnel and outside consulting costs of  incurred to develop and maintain our knowledge base in coins and to identify and analyze acquisition opportunities  and v general expenses and infrastructure costs incurred to support the increased volume of business that we conducted in  as compared with settlement of lawsuit fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands settlement of lawsuit as a percentage of net revenues as previously reported  in january  without any admission of wrongdoing  we settled a legal action brought by real legends  inc  a seller of sports cards against when it was a game wiwag  a sports card dealer  and against us as a co defendant 
pursuant to the settlement terms  all of the claims asserted against the company by plaintiff were settled and plaintiff terminated the litigation  with prejudice  and we paid plaintiff  of which  was reimbursed to us by one of our insurers 
as a result  the net cost to us of the settlement in was  or of our net revenues 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense was recorded at the date of grant only if the quoted market price of the underlying stock on that date exceeded the exercise price of the options

accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation costs recognized in fiscal include i compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july   based on their respective grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and ii compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to june   based on their respective grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  results for the corresponding periods of the prior year have not been restated and the company will continue to disclose the pro forma effect of option grants on net earnings and net earnings per share for periods ended prior to july  in the footnotes to its financial statements 
however  we became aware of an error in the determination of the proforma expense in years prior to adoption  as it relates to our estimate of the expected term assumption 
therefore  the fiscal year proforma expense has been restated as disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
there were no modifications made to outstanding stock options prior to the adoption of sfas no

we will also continue to account for equity instruments issued to persons other than company employees and directors non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for equity instruments issued to non employees are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of any such equity instrument is the earliest to occur of i the date on which the third party performance is complete  ii the date on which it is probable that performance will occur  or iii if different  the date on which the compensation has been earned by the non employee 
however  no equity instruments were issued to non employees for goods or services during the three years ended june  the company issues stock options to employees and outside directors whose only condition for vesting are continued employment or service during the related vesting period 
typically  the vesting period is four years for employee awards and six months for director awards  although awards are sometimes granted with immediate vesting

r  the company calculates stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of each stock option using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
once the compensation cost of an option is determined  that cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the option 
for fiscal  stock based compensation consisted of compensation costs attributable to options granted in prior years that were outstanding but were not fully vested as of july   the effective date of sfas no 
r  and compensation costs for options that were granted during fiscal  prorated from their respective grant dates to june  compensation costs  as determined  were adjusted for estimated forfeitures in accordance with sfas no 
r 
options to purchase a total of approximately  shares of our common stock were granted to employees during fiscal the method we employ to calculate stock based compensation is consistent with the method used to compute stock based compensation under sfas no 
 except that under sfas no 
r  we are required to estimate forfeitures  which we were not required to and did not estimate under sfas no 
we have estimated forfeitures to be per annum 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased the forfeiture rate from to per annum based on estimates of future forfeitures over the remaining term of unvested options at june  and the correction of an error in our earlier estimate as more fully disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
a total of  of compensation expense related to unvested stock based compensation awards remained unrecognized as of june  based on the assumption that the forfeiture rate will remain at per annum  for the remaining vesting periods  that amount will be recognized as compensation expense as follows year ending june  amount total however  these amounts do not include the cost of any additional stock based compensation awards that may be granted in future periods nor  as mentioned above  any changes that might occur in the company s compensation award forfeiture rate

fiscal year ended june dollars in thousands interest income  net percent of net revenue interest income  net totaled  in fiscal year  compared with  in fiscal year  which was primarily attributable to increases in our average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances during fiscal and  to a lesser extent  increased interest rates during fiscal the increase in the average cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances were attributable to i the sale by us of  shares of our common stock in a public offering that we completed in the third quarter of fiscal  which generated net proceeds to us of  and ii cash generated from the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  and iii cash generated by operations  reduced by cash expended for business acquisition in fiscal year interest income  net was  in  compared to  in fiscal the increase in interest income in  compared to  resulted primarily from the same factors as indicated above 
provision for income taxes fiscal year ended june dollars in thousands provision for income taxes income tax expense recorded in fiscal was calculated based on our expected combined federal and state effective income tax rates of approximately for the fiscal year  compared with for the fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate to in fiscal reflects increased permanent differences between the company s income for book purposes and for tax purposes due primarily to the non deductibility of compensation costs on incentive stock options 
the provision made for income taxes in fiscal and were calculated on the basis of our expected federal and state effective income tax rates for those years 
discontinued operations fiscal year ended june dollars in thousands income loss from discontinued operations  net of gain on sales of discontinued businesses net of income taxes as a result of our decision in fiscal to dispose of our collectibles sales businesses  in accordance with sfas no 
the assets and related liabilities of those businesses have been classified as held for sale and their related operating results for fiscal years  and have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the income loss from discontinued operations includes i the losses from the operations of our discontinued collectibles sales businesses through the respective dates on which they were disposed of in fiscal  and ii the losses or gains recognized on the sales of those businesses and the disposition of those assets consisting primarily of inventories and accounts receivables that we retained  and iii for fiscal the results of ctp from september  to november  the date of its disposition 
other than fiscal  when the collectible sales businesses were sold  the gain on disposal of those businesses related to additional consideration on the sales of those businesses that became determinable in fiscal and  as the terms of the sale of some of those businesses included provision for future consideration based on the performance of such businesses for a period of time subsequent to their sales 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality the following tables present unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters beginning september  and ending on june  the information has been derived from our unaudited quarterly financial statements  which have been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial information set forth below includes all adjustments  consisting of normal adjustments and accruals that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
these operating results  which reflect the reclassification of our results of operations between continuing operations and discontinued operations as a result of the disposition of our collectibles sales businesses  are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any subsequent periods 
revenues in the second quarter of fiscal were lower than the revenues for the second quarter of fiscal  due primarily to lower coin submissions from one of our largest customers due to a serious illness that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which resulted in a reduction in revenues earned from that customer in the second quarter and fiscal the increase in revenues of and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  compared to the corresponding periods of the prior year  reflect the continued success of the company s first strike program  which  in fiscal year  generated revenues in both the third and fourth quarters  compared with primarily the third quarter of fiscal in addition  in fiscal  the company benefited from revenues from new businesses that we did not own or operate for the full fiscal year with respect to the sales and marketing costs in our diamond grading business  approximately  was associated with the initial re launch and re positioning of the company at the major trade show of the year in early june which we do not expect to repeat 
along with the newly acquired american gemological laboratories agl  an authentication and grading service in colored gemstones  our aggregate expenditures for sales and marketing will continue at approximately current levels associated with the jewelry division for at least the first three quarters of fiscal as we communicate our new services as part of our strategy to increase market share 
because of the similar distribution channels for gcal and agl  and even though agl is adding new services which will require marketing expenditures  we do not anticipate increases above current levels since many of the expenditures are expected in the same trade publications  the same trade shows and in other related promotional activities 
since we expect revenues to increase at gcal and agl  we also expect that the percentage of revenue associated with sales and marketing expenses will decline 
with respect to the general and administrative expense incurred by our gcal diamond grading business  approximately  was associated with legal and consulting expenses related to the initial integration  in part related to legal expenses to support some of the new proprietary services and programs introduced by gcal during the term such as source veritas 
along with the newly acquired colored gemstone grading business of agl  we expect the integration expenses for software  systems and legal expenses to continue at approximately current levels associated with the jewelry division for at least the first three quarters of as we complete the integration of gcal and initiate and complete the integration of agl 
since we expect revenues to increase at gcal and agl  we also expect that the percentage of revenue associated with their general and administrative expenses will decline

 june  selected operating data units authenticated or graded coins sportscards autographs stamps currency diamonds total liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  as compared to  at june  historically  we have relied on internally generated funds  rather than borrowings  as our primary source of funds to support our grading operations 
additionally  our authentication and grading services have  and in the future we expect that they will  provide us with relatively stable and predictable cash flows  largely because i in many instances our customers prepay for those services at the time they submit their collectibles to us for authentication and grading  and ii in the event of a decline in authentication and grading submissions  we have the ability to reduce our variable operating costs to offset  at least partially  the impact on our cash flows of such a decline 
due to the company having utilized its net operating losses for federal tax purposes by march   the company was required to make federal tax payments on its estimated taxable income in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company continues to have losses and tax credits available for state income tax purposes 
during fiscal  operating activities of our continuing operations provided net cash of  compared with  generated in fiscal investing activities used net cash of  during fiscal  primarily to fund i  used to fund the purchases of the businesses we acquired during the fiscal year  and ii net advances of  that we made under our dealer financing program conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  collectors finance corporation  and iii capital expenditures of  primarily for the purchase of fixed assets 
in fiscal  financing activities used net cash of  including cash of  used to repurchase the company s common stock under the company s stock buyback program see below and  used to pay cash dividends to stockholders see below  partially offset by proceeds of  from the exercise of employee stock options 
bank line of credit 
in fiscal we organized collectors finance corporation cfc  as a wholly owned subsidiary  to engage in the business of making loans primarily to coin dealers 
all such loans are required to be collateralized by the delivery to us of collectibles that have a fair market value of at least the amount of the loans 
the loans are required to be repaid to us when those collectibles are returned to the dealers 
to provide a source of funding for those loans  in june cfc obtained a revolving bank line of credit pursuant to a loan and security agreement that permits cfc to borrow  at any one time  up to the lesser of i  or ii an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of those of its loan receivables that meet the bank s eligibility criteria 
borrowings under that credit line  which has a term of two years ending in june  bear interest at rates based on the bank s prime rate or libor  as applicable  and are secured by the loan receivables due cfc 
there were no borrowings outstanding under that line of credit at june  cfc s obligations under this line of credit have been guaranteed by the company pursuant to a continuing guaranty agreement with the bank lender 
the terms of that agreement require the company to be in compliance with certain financial and other restrictive covenants  and require the consent of the lender i for the payment of cash dividends or repurchases of our common stock in an aggregate amount exceeding its annual net income in any year  and ii to consummate more than  of business acquisitions in any year 
the company was in compliance with all of these covenants at june  and received the required consents from the lender for the purchase of the gemprint business  the repurchase of the company s common stock  and the payment of dividends during fiscal outstanding financial obligations 
we had the following outstanding obligations under operating leases  net of sublease income at june  for years ending june thereafter with the exception of these obligations  we do not have any material financial obligations  such as long term debt  capital lease  or long term purchase obligations 
in the event that cfc incurs any borrowings under its line of credit  we will have an obligation to repay such borrowings  however  as noted above  there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit at june  stock buyback program 
in december  the company s board of directors approved a million stock buyback program 
the program authorizes the company to make up to  of stock repurchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities exchange commission rules  when opportunities to make such repurchases  at attractive prices  become available 
the company is under no obligation to repurchase any shares under the stock buyback program and the timing  actual number and value of shares that may be repurchased under that program will depend on a number of factors  including the company s future financial performance  the company s available cash resources and competing uses for the cash that may arise in the future  prevailing market prices of the company s common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that the company believes are attractive 
during fiscal year  the company repurchased a total of  shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  which includes transaction costs of approximately 
additional information regarding these share repurchases is set forth in item of part ii of this annual report 
dividends 
on may   the board of directors adopted a dividend policy that calls for the payment of an expected total annual cash dividend of per common share  payable in the amount of per share per quarter 
to date  the board of directors has declared the following quarterly cash dividends under this policy 
declaration date record date dividend payment date may  june  june  august  august  september  the declaration of cash dividends in the future  pursuant to the company s dividend policy  is subject to final determination each quarter by the board of directors based on a number of factors  including the company s financial performance and its available cash resources  its cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that the board may conclude would represent an opportunity to generate a greater return on investment for the company 
for these reasons  as well as others  there can be no assurance that the amount of the quarterly cash dividend will not be reduced  or that the board of directors will not decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends  in the future 
we plan to use our cash resources to i expand our existing and implement new marketing programs  ii introduce new services for our customers  iii acquire or start up other high value collectibles or high value asset authentication and grading businesses  iv make private and open market share repurchases under our stock buyback program if there are opportunities to do so at prices that we believe are attractive  v continue paying dividends to our stockholders  as determined by the board of directors  and vi fund working capital requirements  and for other corporate purposes 
although we have no current plans to do so  we also may seek borrowings  and we may issue additional shares of our stock  to finance acquisitions of additional authentication and grading businesses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices  including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other relevant market rate or price risks 
due to the cash and cash equivalent balances that we maintain  we are exposed to risk of changes in short term interest rates 
at june   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  primarily invested in money market funds 
reductions in short term interest rates could result in reductions in the amount of that income 
however  the impact on our operating results of such changes is not expected to be material 
the company has no activities that would expose it to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risks
