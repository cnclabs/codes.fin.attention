financial condition liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dispositions  dividends  adequacy of commercial paper and available bank lines of credit  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
the company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position  with enough liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing the capital structure on a short and long term basis 
the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of cash flows twelve months ended december  cash flows from continuing operations in thousands cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by operating activities during increased million  or  compared to  which included a tax refund of approximately million 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital  which was partially offset by an million pension contribution  higher benefits and compensation payouts and an increase in tax payments of approximately million in cash used in investing activities during increased million compared to  reflecting an increase in acquisition and capital expenditure activity  partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of businesses and sale of property and equipment 
acquisition expenditures in were  million compared to million in capital expenditures in increased million to million as compared to million in  primarily due to investments in plant expansions  plant machinery and information systems 
proceeds from the disposition of businesses increased million to million 
the company currently anticipates that any additional acquisitions made during will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and  if necessary  through the issuance of commercial paper  established lines of credit or public debt markets 
capital expenditures for are expected to increase moderately over levels 
cash provided by financing activities during totaled million as compared to cash used in financing activities of million during the net change in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a net increase in borrowings of million that were used to fund current year acquisitions partially offset by cash used in the repurchase of treasury shares million and dividends paid of million 
adjusted working capital a non gaap measure  calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable increased from december  by million or to  million  primarily driven by increases in receivables of million  increases in payables of million offset by decreases in inventory of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions on working capital of million and changes in foreign currency of million  working capital decreased by million or from december  the increase in receivables was driven by increased revenue activity and acquisitions of million  partially offset by decreases due to foreign currency fluctuations of million 
the inventory balance decrease was driven by operations and decreases due to foreign currency fluctuations of million  partially offset by acquisitions of million 
increases in accounts payable were a result of a concerted effort by management to better align the payable cycle with the company s cash receipts cycle  acquisitions of million  partially offset by a decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations of million 
in addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating  investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flow  the company also measures free cash flow a non gaap measure 
management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase dover s common stock 
for further information see non gaap disclosures at the end of this item free cash flow for the year ended december  was million or of revenue compared to million or of revenue in the prior year period  which included a tax refund of approximately million in the first quarter of the increase in free cash flow reflected higher net earnings and incremental decreases in working capital  which was partially offset by pension contributions of million to the knowles electronics holdings  inc pension plan  higher benefits and compensation payouts and increased capital expenditures of million and tax payments of approximately million

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the company  including information regarding contingencies  risk and its financial condition 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where the financial information of dover is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include the following areas revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b price is fixed or determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d delivery has occurred 
in revenue transactions where installation is required  revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
revenue transactions involving non essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers 
if the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product  revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete 
in a limited number of revenue transactions  other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and  accordingly  revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay  or acceptance has been confirmed 
service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated at the individual operating companies based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though dover considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required 
inventory for the majority of the company s subsidiaries  including all international subsidiaries and the technologies segment  are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
other domestic inventory is stated at cost  determined on the last in  first out lifo basis  which is less than market value 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
technologies companies tend to experience higher levels of inventory value fluctuations  particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time 
occasionally  the company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation in accordance with appropriate accounting principles 
these reserves  for both severance and exit costs  require the use of estimates 
though dover believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs  actual results may be different than the estimated amounts 
dover has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines including sfas no 
for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
dover s assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist 
the company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations 
the valuation of dover s pension and other post retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  projected salary increases and benefits  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in dover s pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to assure that they accurately account for dover s future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on dover s pension expenses and related funding requirements 
dover s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns  economic trends and portfolio allocation 
dover s discount rate assumption is determined by constructing a portfolio of bonds to match the expected benefit stream to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities  as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
dover has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly 
these assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations  changes in tax codes and rulings  changes in statutory tax rates  and the company s future taxable income levels 
dover has significant accruals and reserves related to its risk management program 
these accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability 
the company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions  dover s experience  and relevant industry data 
dover considers the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and company experience 
dover has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify dover s ultimate exposure in these matters 
the valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to assure that dover is properly reserved 
reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues 
while dover believes that the current level of reserves is adequate  future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations 
the company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons 
estimates are used to adjust  if necessary  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
these estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale 
the adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold 
changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates

free cash flow  net debt  total capitalization  operational working capital  revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities  debt or equity  revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with gaap and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
management believes the net debt to total capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity 
net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the company s capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs 
free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions  pay dividends  repay debt and repurchase dover s common stock 
reconciliations of free cash flow  total debt and net debt can be found above in this item  management s discussion and analysis 
management believes that reporting operational working capital also sometimes called adjusted working capital  which is calculated as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable  provides a meaningful measure of the company s operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue 
in addition  management believes that reporting operational working capital and revenue at constant currency  which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  provides a meaningful measure of the company s operational changes  given the global nature of dover s businesses 
management also believes that reporting organic revenue growth  which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions  provides a useful comparison of the company s revenue performance and trends between periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt  interest rate swaps attached thereto  commercial paper borrowings and investments in cash equivalents 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates of the company s weighted average long term debt interest rate would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt 
commercial paper borrowings are at variable interest rates  and have maturities of three months or less 
a basis point increase or decrease in the interest rates of the company s weighted average commercial paper interest rate on commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
the company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates of the company s weighted average interest rate would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax income 
as of december   the company had two interest rate swaps outstanding  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not enter into derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign exchange the company conducts business in various foreign countries  primarily in canada  europe  brazil  china and other asian countries 
therefore  changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its investment in foreign operations 
as of december   the company had not established a formal company wide foreign currency hedging program but may  from time to time  for a specific exposure  enter into fair value hedges 
certain individual operating companies that have foreign exchange exposure have established formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and or cash flow hedging 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change of or less in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
