industry overview and trends the agricultural inputs market in the united states was estimated at billion in  and has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately over the past fifteen years  as measured by total revenues  according to the most recent available data from the usda national agricultural statistics service 
the growth is due to  among other things  continued population growth  the use of more effective chemicals and fertilizer  relatively stable planted acreage  the trend towards larger and more efficient farms  and the increased adoption of seed varieties with enhanced technology 
the three primary product categories of the agricultural input and professional non crop markets are chemicals  fertilizer  and seed 
chemicals 
agricultural chemicals expenditures in the united states were estimated at billion in  according to the most recent available data provided by the usda national agricultural statistics service 
the chemical product category s fifteen year compound annual growth rate is approximately  according to the same source  primarily due to the replacement of higher priced patented products with lower priced generic products 
the volume of agricultural chemicals sold in the united states continues to increase but overall revenues have remained essentially flat since this product category includes i herbicides  which keep weed infestations from depriving crops of plant nutrients and water  ii insecticides  which keep insects from damaging crops  iii fungicides  which guard against plant diseases  and iv other chemicals such as adjuvants and surfactants 
fertilizer 
fertilizer expenditures in the united states were estimated at billion in  according to the most recent available data provided by the usda national agricultural statistics service 
the last three years have seen significant price increases in fertilizer products  especially in nitrogen based fertilizer products  with continued increases forecast for nitrogen based fertilizer  for example  anhydrous ammonia  urea  and uan solutions  are manufactured using natural gas as the primary feedstock 
increased natural gas costs have caused price appreciation across the entire fertilizer market 
from through forecast  fertilizer expenditures in the united states grew at a compound annual rate of approximately per year  based on data available from the usda national agricultural statistics service 
fertilizer is added to the soil to replace or supplement one or more deficient nutrients necessary for plant growth 
nearly all commercial crops grown in the united states and canada today are produced with the use of a commercial fertilizer  as modern crop varieties and higher yields cannot be sustained by other methods 
seed 
seed expenditures in the united states were estimated at billion in  according to the most recent available data provided by the usda national agricultural statistics service 
as a result of improvements in seed technology  the seed market in the united states has experienced a compound annual growth rate of over the past fifteen years  according to the same source  driven primarily by increased pricing 
in particular  biological traits are being genetically engineered into seeds  either increasing farm efficiencies with respect to labor and equipment  reducing the need for chemical treatment  or providing output trait benefits such as drought tolerance or high oil content 
these traits include providing a plant with the ability to resist pests without a chemical application and the ability of a plant to selectively resist the effects of herbicides 
these technological improvements  together with the availability of more productive seed hybrids  have resulted in higher crop yields as well as increased seed expenditures 

table of contents business operations we manage our businesses on a centralized basis with operating managers focused on product categories and geographic regions throughout the united states and canada 
each geographic region sells and distributes agricultural inputs and professional non crop products and offers services to farmers  commercial growers  regional dealers  and professional non crop customers in each region based on the specific crops and industry practices in that geography 
our operations entail a network of approximately sales and distribution facilities throughout the united states and canada 
additionally  we operate three formulation facilities that produce some of our proprietary and private label chemicals and plant nutrition products 
we source  formulate  package  and market certain of our proprietary and private label products and provide formulating  blending  and packaging services for third parties  primarily our major suppliers 
sales of our proprietary and private label chemicals and seed accounted for approximately of our total chemical and seed sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal distribution operations we operate distribution centers and locations serving retailers  growers  and professional non crop customers 
retail centers typically service end users within a to mile radius of their locations 
we operate retail centers in most major crop producing regions of the united states 
our distribution network  though centrally managed  is operated by region due to its size

our product offering  coupled with the advice of our sales professionals  provides our customers with a one stop shop for all their agricultural and or professional non crop needs 
chemicals 
sales of chemicals to both agricultural and professional non crop customers represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our net sales in fiscal we distribute a full range of chemicals  through our distribution locations  including herbicides  insecticides  
table of contents fungicides  adjuvants  and surfactants 
we also provide a variety of services related to the application of certain chemicals 
fertilizer 
we distribute a full range of fertilizer products through our distribution centers  including nitrogen  potassium  and phosphorous  as well as various micronutrients such as iron  boron  and calcium 
we also provide fertilizer application services and customized fertilizer blending for the specific needs of individual growers 
seed 
we have placed an emphasis on new seed technology and provide a complete range of seed and seed treatments to growers through our distribution centers 
many of our seed products are sourced from leading seed companies and sold both under their brand names and our private labels for example  dyna gro 
as a result of advances in seed technology  we often bundle chemicals with complementary seed products 
services 
in addition to selling traditional crop production inputs  our distribution centers provide agronomic services to growers 
these services range from traditional custom blending and application of crop nutrients to meet the needs of individual growers  to more sophisticated and technologically advanced services such as soil sampling  pest level monitoring  and yield monitoring using global position systems satellite grids and satellite linked variable rate spreaders and applicators to analyze the data 
in addition  we recently launched a comprehensive crop and soil nutritional service called nutriscription 
this service provides specific recommendations for a customer s crop or turf needs 
professional products 
we also distribute chemicals  fertilizer  and seed to various professional non crop markets  such as turf and ornamental golf courses  resorts  nurseries  and greenhouses  pest control operators  forestry  and vegetation management 
the professional non crop products business is a niche market unique from most of our agricultural customers and requires different service levels 
we service these unique markets from our locations that lie close to suburban areas or leisure centers 
we believe we are the only national distributor in our markets with a presence in the three major professional non crop market areas of turf and ornamental  pest control operators  and vegetation management 
sales to professional non crop customers are included in our discussion of chemicals  fertilizer  and seed

proprietary and private label products we coordinate the marketing  registration and regulatory affairs  sourcing  formulation  and packaging operations for our proprietary and private label products 
our marketing group works with our operating regions to manage our product portfolio  sales activities  advertising  and technical service 
we operate three formulation 
table of contents facilities that produce certain of our proprietary branded products as well as some private label products 
these products are developed independently by us or in cooperation with our leading suppliers 
these products are distributed almost entirely through our network of distribution locations 
additionally  we maintain over federal sub registrations from basic manufacturers 
in order to support these proprietary private label products and sub registrations  we maintain approximately  state registrations 
we market approximately of our own proprietary branded products 
we have a broad product offering of proprietary brands in each of our product categories 
some of our key proprietary branded products in each category are listed in the table below categories key proprietary branded products chemicals adjuvants saber  savage  salvo  strategy  amplify  li  choice  weather guard  liberate  activator  boll buster fertilizer aca  awaken  nortrace seed and seed treatments dyna gro  dynastart  so fast professional non crop signature  bisect our proprietary and private label products allow us to enhance our product offering and provide formulations designed to meet the needs of growers and professional non crop users 
as a result  we typically are able to obtain a higher contribution margin from our proprietary and private label products than from the branded products we distribute from other suppliers 
we believe our proprietary and private label products represent a significant value for our customers and help increase the overall value of our suppliers products 
our formulation plants also provide formulating  blending  and packaging services for third parties  primarily our major suppliers  allowing us to leverage our fixed costs and increase plant efficiencies 
intellectual property we use a wide array of technological and proprietary processes to enhance our chemical  fertilizer  seed  and product development programs 
we believe these technologies and proprietary processes enable us to create novel product concepts and reduce time to market 
in certain circumstances  we file for patents on technology that we believe is patentable 
as of february   we held approximately trademarks pending or registered in the united states either directly or through one of our subsidiaries  and united agri products canada inc  one of our subsidiaries  held approximately canadian trademarks pending or registered either directly or through one of its subsidiaries 
these trademarks pertain to products formulated and distributed by us  including chemicals  plant nutrition products  fertilizer  and seed 
in addition  we possess contractual rights to certain trademarks held by third parties through arrangements with certain of our suppliers and distributors 
intellectual property rights help protect our products and technologies from use by competitors and others 
in addition to trademarks  intellectual property rights of importance to us include trade secrets  confidential statements of formulation  and other proprietary manufacturing information 
we use nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary and confidential information 
such nondisclosure agreements specifically address the confidential information disclosed and concern the protection of our intellectual property 
our objectives are to prevent disclosure of sensitive information and to protect our legal interests if our trade secrets are appropriated 
we will continue to aggressively enforce all of our intellectual property rights 
seasonality our and our customers businesses are seasonal  based upon the planting  growing  and harvesting cycles 
during fiscal through  greater than of our net sales occurred during the first and second fiscal 
table of contents quarters of each year because of the condensed nature of the planting season 
as a result of the seasonality of sales  we experience significant quarterly fluctuations in our revenues  income  and working capital levels 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations for further information 
our integrated network of formulation and blending  distribution and warehousing facilities  and technical expertise allows us to efficiently process  distribute  and store products close to our end users and to supply our customers on a timely basis during the compressed planting and growing seasons 
see item a 
risk factors our and our customers businesses are subject to seasonality and this may affect our revenues  carrying costs and collection of receivables for further information 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  the amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility varies significantly throughout the fiscal year 
during fiscal  outstanding borrowings net of cash on hand reached a period end peak of million on october   while cash on hand reached a period end peak of million with no borrowings under the revolving credit facility on february  our average period end borrowings net of cash on hand for fiscal  were approximately million 
competition the market for the distribution of chemicals  fertilizer  seed  and agronomic services is highly competitive 
in each of our local markets  we typically compete with two or more other distributors 
these distributors include agricultural cooperatives  multinational corporation owned distribution outlets  and other independent distribution companies 
agricultural cooperatives are operated for the benefit of their member growers and include companies such as agriliance  llc  and growmark  inc multinational corporation owned distribution outlets include companies such as helena chemical company a subsidiary of marubeni corporation and royster clark  inc recently acquired by agrium inc 
we generally compete with other distributors on the basis of breadth of product offering  ability to provide one stop shopping with customized local products and services  our sales force s knowledge of and relationships with our customers  and price 
additionally  we compete within our industry for talented employees in the areas of sales and operations 
we strive to provide a competitive compensation and benefits package to retain and attract key employees 
sales on credit  extensions of credit  and accounts receivable a significant portion of our sales to growers and independent retailers are made through the use of our credit programs 
typically  we sell products and services on cash or credit terms  with credit terms ranging from days to crop terms 
crop terms typically require payment in december following harvest 
many customer accounts accrue service charges 
the interest rate on such service charges varies by state  subject to maximum allowable interest under the particular state s laws 
as of february   our aggregate accounts receivable  most of which constituted extensions of credit to trade customers  totaled million compared to million as of february  we have a dedicated and focused credit department  responsible for all our credit and customer receivable risk management 
our credit department is also responsible for establishing credit terms and credit limits  compiling data and generating reports to monitor collections  reserves for bad debt  and progress of credit related initiatives  assuring data integrity  and distributing relevant reports to our field credit managers 
our credit policies and procedures include a detailed computerized analysis of a particular customer s credit prior to the sale  routine monitoring of customer credit limits  and systematic inactivation of non conforming accounts 
our centralized credit and procurement functions are responsible for coordinating various sales and working capital initiatives 
our customer prepay program  coordinated by our sales  credit  and procurement staffs  encourages 
table of contents customers to prepay us for their future crop input needs 
as of february   we had a net balance of customer prepayments  which are classified as current liabilities  of million compared to million as of february  management information systems our finance  credit  and information technology departments are responsible for all our financial reporting  information technology and operating systems  treasury and cash management  financial analysis and budgeting  tax filings  and credit and risk management 
in addition  our finance and credit departments perform financial modeling and analysis  due diligence  and contract negotiations for acquisitions 
our credit department also establishes credit terms and credit limits  compiles data and generates reports to monitor collections  reserves for bad debt  and progress of credit related initiatives  assures data integrity  and distributes relevant reports to the field credit managers 
we have a point of sale computer system at our locations  which provide daily reports  including sales and profitability data  credit information  and working capital data 
we use these systems to provide data for inventory control  credit controls  budgeting  forecasting  and working capital management requirements 
raw materials and supplies we purchase chemicals and seed from many of the world s leading agricultural input and professional non crop manufacturers 
we have contracts with basf  bayer crop science  dow agrosciences  dupont  monsanto  syngenta  and other prominent suppliers in the industry 
we purchase chemical and seed products at the manufacturer s distributor price and typically receive a rebate based on volume and type of product 
the rebate is typically paid near the end of the calendar year  but may be partially paid in advance 
such rebate programs may be published programs  in which case rebates are calculated similarly among all buyers  or unpublished programs  in which case rebates are structured solely according to our business 
we purchase fertilizer from many of the world s leading fertilizer manufacturers 
our largest suppliers are agrium  conagra international fertilizer company  mosaic  koch industries  simplot  potash corp  and terra 
we purchase at the supplier s market price and may receive a rebate based on our purchased volume with a particular supplier 
we may prepay for fertilizer in advance of our peak selling seasons late fall and early spring in order to lock in a price for a portion of our forecasted need 
employees and labor relations as of february   we employed approximately  non unionized and salaried employees  approximately unionized employees  and approximately temporary employees to meet our seasonal needs 
we believe we have good relations with our employees 
all our unionized employees work at our formulation facility in greenville  mississippi  and are all subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
this collective bargaining agreement is scheduled to expire in august  but is subject to automatic renewals for additional year long periods unless otherwise terminated 
we have not had any work stoppages in the past five years 
environmental matters our facilities and operations must comply with a wide variety of federal  state  and local environmental laws  regulations and ordinances  including those related to air emissions  water discharges  and chemical and 
table of contents hazardous waste management and disposal 
our operations are regulated at the federal level under numerous laws  including the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act  the emergency planning and community right to know act  the clean air act the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the occupational safety and health act  the hazardous materials transportation act  and  at the state level  analogous state laws and regulations 
our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health  primarily the rules of the occupational safety and health administration and the united states department of transportation 
non compliance with these environmental  health  and safety laws can result in significant fines or penalties or restrictions on our ability to sell or transport products 
we manage these regulatory risks by employing a staff of highly trained professionals  by performing periodic compliance audits  and by participating in industry stewardship initiatives 
we believe that our operations are in compliance in all material respects with current requirements under environmental  transportation  and employee safety laws  except for matters that are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions  results of operations  or liquidity 
environmental laws may hold current owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners or operators releases of hazardous or toxic substances  materials or wastes  pollutants or contaminants  including petroleum and petroleum products 
because of our operations  the history of industrial or commercial uses at some of our facilities  the operations of predecessor owners or operators of some of the facilities  and the use  production and release of hazardous substances at these sites  we are affected by the liability provisions of environmental laws 
many of our facilities have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny in the past and are or may be subject to further regulatory inspections  future requests for investigation  or liability for hazardous substance management practices 
from time to time  we incur expenses in connection with remediation of hazardous substances  including chemicals and fertilizer in soil and or groundwater at our current and former facilities 
while a portion of this work is conducted on a voluntary basis under state law  most of it is conducted as part of a state directed enforcement action  some of which provides for reimbursement of expenses by state agricultural funds 
in addition  we are engaged in corrective action under the resource conservation and recovery act at our facilities in billings  montana and garden city  kansas  and our former facility in nichols  iowa 
we have also removed or closed underground storage tanks from some of our facilities and  in some instances  are responding to historic releases at these locations 
in total  both voluntary and government ordered cleanups of releases of hazardous substances are planned or being performed at approximately sites 
in some cases  third parties including government reimbursement funds and insurers may contribute to the costs of cleanup at these sites 
without consideration of third party contributions  the cost of these on going and potential response actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended cercla  provides for responses to  and  in some instances  joint and several liability for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
at the present time  there are three off site disposal or formulation facilities at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under cercla malone in texas city  tx  red panther in clarksdale  ms  and aberdeen pesticide dump in aberdeen  nc we believe that the cost of participating in these on going and potential response actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
conagra has agreed to provide us with a partial reimbursement of costs that we may incur in the future relating to any cleanup requirements arising out of certain environmental conditions at our greenville  mississippi facility that existed prior to the acquisition 
on october   december   and december   three separate lawsuits were filed in the circuit court of washington county  mississippi against our subsidiary  platte chemical co 
platte  and certain former employees of platte  relating to alleged releases from platte s greenville  mississippi facility 
the plaintiffs in such suits are seeking compensation for alleged personal injury and property damage 
in connection with the acquisition  conagra agreed to partially reimburse us  subject to a cap  for fees and expenses we incur in connection with such lawsuits 
subsequent to november   another 
table of contents lawsuit not covered by the conagra cost sharing agreement was filed in the circuit court of washington county  mississippi against us and apollo management  lp apollo  which lawsuit relates to the same alleged releases from the greenville  mississippi facility 
while discovery in the greenville litigations is not yet complete  based on information available to us at this time we do not believe that such litigations  if adversely determined  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
regulatory licenses and approvals as a seller and distributor of crop production inputs  we are subject to registration requirements under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and related state statutes  which require us to provide information to regulatory authorities regarding the benefits and risks of the products we sell and distribute  and to periodically update that information 
risk information supplied to governmental authorities by us or others could result in the cancellation of products or in limitations on their use 
in addition  these laws regulate information contained in product labels and in promotional materials  require that products are manufactured in adherence to manufacturing specifications  and impose reporting and recordkeeping requirements relating to production and sale of certain pesticides 
non compliance with these environmental  health and safety laws can result in significant fines  penalties  or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
based on our experience to date  these requirements are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flow  or results of operations 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flow  or results of operations 
our and our customers businesses are subject to seasonality and this may affect our revenues  carrying costs  and collection of receivables 
our and our customers businesses are seasonal  based upon the planting  growing and harvesting cycles  and the inherent seasonality of the industry we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business 
during fiscal   and  greater than of our net sales occurred during the first and second fiscal quarters of each year because of the condensed nature of the planting and growing seasons 
because interim period operating results reflect the seasonal nature of our business  they are not indicative of results expected for the full fiscal year 
in addition  quarterly results can vary significantly from one year to the next due primarily to weather related shifts in planting schedules and purchase patterns 
we incur substantial expenditures for fixed costs throughout the year and substantial expenditures for inventory in advance of the spring planting season 
seasonality also relates to the limited windows of opportunity that our customers have to complete required tasks at each stage of crop cultivation 
should events such as adverse weather or transportation interruptions occur during these seasonal windows  we would face the possibility of reduced revenue without the opportunity to recover until the following season 
in addition  because of the seasonality of agriculture  we face the risk of significant inventory carrying costs should our customers activities be curtailed during their normal seasons 
the seasonality of our industry can also affect the amount of customer bad debt that may result on our books and can negatively impact our accounts receivable collections 
weather conditions may materially impact the demand for our products and services 
weather conditions have a significant impact on the farm economy and  consequently  on our operating results 
weather conditions affect the demand and  in some cases  the supply of products  which in turn may have an impact on our prices 
for example  weather patterns such as flood  drought  or frost can cause crop failures that in turn affect the supply of feed and seed and the marketing of grain products  as well as the demand for chemicals  fertilizer  seed  and other agronomic supplies 
in recent years  we have experienced unusually severe weather conditions  including hurricanes  ice storms  floods  wind damage  and a summer dearth of water and pasture in some states 
adverse weather conditions can also impact the financial position of agricultural producers who do business with us  including producers to whom we extend credit 
this  in turn  may adversely affect the ability of those producers to pay their obligations to us in a timely manner 
accordingly  the weather can have a material effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow  or results of operations 
our industry is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales and profit margins 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry  particularly with respect to price and service 
our principal competitors in the distribution of crop production inputs include agricultural cooperatives  international fertilizer producers  major grain companies  independent distributors  and brokers 
some of our competitors may have greater financial  marketing  and research and development resources  and or better name recognition than we do and can better withstand adverse economic or market conditions 
in addition  as a result of increased pricing pressures caused by competition  we may experience reductions in the profit margins on sales or may be unable to pass future material price increases on to our customers  each of which would reduce profit margins 

table of contents government regulation and agricultural policy may affect the demand for our products and therefore our financial viability 
existing and future government regulations and laws may greatly influence how we operate our business  our business strategy  and ultimately  our financial viability 
existing and future laws may impact the amounts and locations of pesticide and fertilizer applications 
the clean water act and the equivalent state and local water pollution control laws are designed to protect water quality 
pesticide and fertilizer applications have been identified as a source of water pollution and are currently regulated and may be more closely regulated in the future 
this regulation may lead to decreases in the quantity of pesticides and fertilizer applied to crops 
the application of fertilizer can also result in the emissions of nitrogen compounds and particulate matter into the air 
compliance with future requirements to limit these emissions under the clean air act and the equivalent state and local air pollution control laws may affect the quantity and or timing of fertilizer used by our customers 
us governmental policies and regulations may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted  the level of inventories  the mix of crops planted  crop prices  and the amounts of and locations where pesticides and fertilizer may be applied 
the market for our products could also be affected by challenges brought under the endangered species act and by changes in regulatory policies affecting genetically modified seeds 
our industry is dependent on farm expenditures for crop inputs 
factors that affect the levels of crop input spending could adversely impact our business 
we operate in the agricultural inputs distribution industry 
our industry depends on farm expenditures for crop inputs  which in turn is dependent upon planted acreage in the united states 
the amount of crop input expenditures and planted acreage can be impacted by the following factors grain prices  crops planted in other parts of the world including brazil and argentina  the types of crops planted in the us  which have various levels of input spending requirements  government subsidies  and our customer s net income levels  which can be impacted by the above factors as well as interest rates  labor costs  fuel prices  and crop input costs 
our growth within the agricultural inputs distribution industry is partially dependent upon acquisitions  which could adversely affect our future performance 
the growth in net sales and operating income of our business depends in part on our ability to expand through acquisitions and on our ability to assimilate new businesses and locations into our existing operations successfully 
our failure to do this could adversely impact our future financial performance 
please refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations building upon our distribution network for more information 
we are subject to expenses  claims  and liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment 
as a producer and distributor of crop production inputs  we must comply with federal  state  and local environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations

our operations are regulated at the federal level under numerous laws  including the clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the occupational safety and health act  and at the state level under analogous state laws and regulations 
as a formulator  seller  and distributor of crop production inputs  we are also subject to registration requirements under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and related state statutes  which require us to provide information to regulatory authorities regarding the 
table of contents benefits and risks of the products we sell and distribute  and to update that information 
risk information supplied to governmental authorities by us or others could result in the cancellation of products or in limitations on their use

currently  four such claims are pending in relation to our platte facility 
in addition  we may discover currently unknown environmental problems or conditions 
the continued compliance with environmental laws  the discovery of currently unknown environmental problems or conditions  changes in environmental  health  and safety laws  and regulations or other unanticipated events may subject us to material expenditures or liabilities in the future 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business or pay dividends on our common stock 
as of february   we had million of outstanding indebtedness  consisting of million of the senior notes and million of the senior discount notes 
there were no obligations then outstanding related to our revolving credit facility 
we are a highly leveraged company and this level of leverage could have important consequences  including the following it may limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business 
we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
it may make our financial results more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy 
it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes  such as payments of dividends on our common stock 
it may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition if we are unable to service our indebtedness or obtain additional financing  as needed 
in addition  the indenture governing the senior notes  the indenture governing the senior discount notes  and the revolving credit facility contain financial and other restrictive covenants discussed below that may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt 

table of contents restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies or pay dividends on our common stock 
the revolving credit facility  the indenture governing the senior notes  and the indenture governing the senior discount notes limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations  pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders  repurchase or redeem our stock  make investments  grant liens  make capital expenditures  enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  sell assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies 
in addition  the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio and minimum ebitda as defined in our revolving credit facility  if revolving credit availability drops below million 
although we have historically always been able to maintain this financial ratio and minimum ebitda  we may not be able to maintain this ratio and minimum ebitda in the future 
covenants in the revolving credit facility may also impair our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to enter into acquisitions or joint ventures or engage in other favorable business activities 
if we default under the revolving credit facility under certain circumstances  the lenders could require immediate payment of the entire principal amount 
these circumstances include  among other things  a change of control  default under agreements governing our other indebtedness  material judgments in excess of a specified amount  or breach of representations and warranties 
any default under the revolving credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under our other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the lenders under the revolving credit facility require immediate repayment  we will not be able to repay them and also repay our other indebtedness in full 
our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
on may   we launched a tender offer for our senior discount notes and the senior notes in order to refinance our long term debt and obtain consents to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants from the indentures 
we cannot assure you that the tender offer and consent solicitation will be successful 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments  for more information regarding the refinancing of our long term debt 
our profitability depends significantly on rebates from our suppliers 
if we are unsuccessful in earning  negotiating  or collecting rebates  it could have an adverse impact on our business 
we receive rebates from chemical and seed suppliers based on programs offered to all of their customers 
the programs vary based on product type and specific supplier practice 
the majority of the rebate programs run on a crop year basis  typically from october st to september th  although other periods are sometimes utilized 
the majority of these rebates are product specific and are based on our sales of that product in a given crop year 

table of contents our ability to earn  negotiate  and collect rebates is critical to the success of our business 
generally  we sell the chemicals and seed we purchase from suppliers at a reduced margin  with the profit from any sales of such products being made primarily from rebates from suppliers 
we price our products to our customers based on the amount of rebates we expect to receive at year end 
however  the amount of rebates we earn and the nature of our rebate programs are determined by our suppliers and are directly related to the performance of our business 
if our sales in any crop year are lower than expected  either because of poor weather conditions  increased competition  or for any other reason  we may earn fewer rebates  and our gross margins may suffer 
additionally  our suppliers may reduce the amount of rebates offered under their programs  or increase the sales goals or other conditions we must meet to earn rebates to levels that we cannot achieve 
finally  our ability to negotiate individually for additional rebates may cease or become limited  and our efforts to collect cash rebates periodically throughout the year may be unsuccessful 
the occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on our margins  net income  or business 
for more information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates vendor rebate receivables and note in notes to financial statements 
our success depends on a limited number of key employees and we may not be able to adequately replace them if they leave 
we believe that the success of our business strategy and our ability to operate profitably depend on the continued employment of our senior management team 
the loss of the services of some of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on us

risk factors 
our business we are the largest independent distributor of agricultural inputs and professional non crop products in the united states and canada 
we strive to be the distributor of choice in our industry and earn the trust of our customers and suppliers by providing high quality products at competitive prices  supported by consistent and reliable service  and expertise 
our customers include farmers  commercial growers  regional dealers  and consumers in the professional non crop market 
over  customers purchased products or services from us during fiscal we market a comprehensive line of products  including chemicals  fertilizer  and seed manufactured by the world s leading agricultural input companies  including basf  bayer  conagra international fertilizer company  dow  dupont  monsanto  and syngenta 
in addition to our product offering  we provide a broad array of value added services including crop management  biotechnology advisory services  custom blending  inventory management  and custom applications of crop inputs 
the products and services we offer are critical to our customers because they lower the overall cost of crop production and improve crop quality and yield 
in addition to the products we purchase from our suppliers for resale  we also source  formulate  package  market  and distribute over brands of proprietary and private label products 
these products allow us to obtain a higher gross margin than from the other branded products we distribute 
sales of our proprietary and private label chemical and seed products accounted for of our total chemical and seed sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal our operations entail a network of approximately sales and distribution facilities and three formulation plants strategically located in major crop producing areas of the united states and canada 
our integrated distribution network enables our  salespeople to provide our customers with a broad range of products and reliable service 
as a result of our broad scale  we provide leading agricultural and professional product input 
table of contents companies with an efficient means to access a highly fragmented customer base of farmers  growers  and professional non crop consumers 
our and our customers businesses are highly seasonal  based upon the planting  growing  and harvesting cycles 
during the last three fiscal years  greater than of our net sales occurred during the first and second fiscal quarters of each year because of the condensed nature of the planting season 
as a result of the seasonality of sales  we experience significant fluctuations in our revenues  net income  and net working capital levels throughout our fiscal year 
the agricultural inputs distribution industry we operate in the highly competitive agricultural inputs distribution industry 
our industry depends on farm expenditures for crop inputs  which in turn is dependent upon planted acreage in the united states and canada 
over the last fifteen years  agricultural input expenses in the united states grew at a compound annual growth rate of  based on historical data obtained from the economic research service of the usda 
planted acreage has been relatively flat over the last fifteen years  leading to a relatively stable but very competitive industry for crop inputs 
the key drivers of our industry include continued world population growth  the use of more effective chemicals and fertilizer  stable planted acreage  the trend towards larger and more efficient farms  the increased production of renewable fuels from corn  soybeans  and other crops  and the increased use of biotechnology in the production of seed 
the three primary product areas of the agricultural input and professional non crop markets are chemicals  fertilizer  and seed 
our principal competitors in the distribution of crop production inputs include agricultural cooperatives  national and international fertilizer producers  major grain companies  independent distributors  and brokers 
we  along with other agricultural input distributors  represent the main route to market for agricultural and professional non crop input manufacturers and fill a critical need in the us and canadian agricultural and professional non crop input markets by allowing suppliers to economically access a highly fragmented customer base of growers  dealers  and professional non crop customers 
in each of our local markets  we typically compete with two or more distributors on the basis of breadth of product offering  the ability to provide one stop shopping with customized local products and services  our sales force s knowledge of and relationships with our customers  and price 
additionally  we compete with our industry peers for talented employees in the areas of sales and operations 
our industry in general is affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  cost to distribute products  customer financial condition  local and national laws and regulations  economic conditions  employment  inflation  political climate  interest rates  fuel prices  and weather patterns 
our opportunities within the industry include the use of our national distribution network to further participate in the growing fertilizer and seed markets as we extend those product offerings to existing customers  continue expanding our proprietary and private label lines of chemicals and seed  grow market share where gaps exist through sales force penetration  adding or acquiring locations  and gaining additional efficiencies in working capital and expenses 
market conditions and outlook approximately million acres  on average over the past fifteen years  were planted per year in principal crops according to the usda 
during this period  no year s planted acreage deviated more than from the average  providing a stable base for the agricultural inputs industry 
the last two years have seen total acres planted in principal crops fall slightly below average  with acres planted at just under million 
although planted acreage dropped in recent years  agricultural input spending during that same two year period rose 
table of contents approximately 
acres forecast to be planted in  according to the most recent survey by informa economics  inc  are expected to increase over last year by approximately 
according to the most recent forecast by the economic research service of the usda  crop input expenses for are expected to be billion  a increase over fertilizer and seed combined make up approximately of the total industry  with growth rates of and  respectively  forecast for however  because we are a distributor of fertilizer  our opportunity to capture increased gross profits related to the forecast appreciation in the fertilizer market is decreased since we typically pass through higher product costs and only retain a specific per ton margin 
the charts below summarize the historical data related to crop input expenses  acres planted  and crop input expenses per acre 
logo logo logo 
table of contents despite rising crop input expenses per acre planted  the two year period of and created unprecedented farm income 
both crop and livestock commodities experienced exceptionally favorable market price and or production conditions 
however  the most recent available data from the economic research service of the usda  forecasts a significant decline in net farm income compared to the culmination of lower government payments  higher interest rates  higher fuel expenses  and higher fertilizer and crop input costs  combined with lower forecasted prices for crop and livestock commodities are the reasons for the expected reduction 
while is currently not forecast to be as strong as and  net farm income is projected to be slightly above the year average 
crop input expenses represent approximately of the total farm production budget 
because crop input expenses are a relatively small percentage of the farm production budget  it is difficult to predict what impact  if any  this may have on ethanol made from corn and bio diesel made from soybeans may provide a future alternative to our country s dependency on foreign based petroleum 
ethanol production has more than doubled since and is continuing to grow rapidly 
the energy policy act of requires billion gallons of renewable fuels to be used in the nation s highway fuel supply by more ethanol and bio diesel production should equate to increased corn and soybean acres planted 
strategic initiatives we will continue to seek to grow our business  improve profitability  and improve working capital through the following principal strategies expanding our distribution network and leveraging our scale  growing our presence in fertilizer  seed  and our proprietary and private label products  and targeting continued profitability enhancement through working capital and expense management 
building upon our distribution network one of our key initiatives is to grow our business by leveraging our size and leading market share across north america 
we study our market share by state  county  and customer  and develop sales initiatives at local and regional levels to address any gaps and opportunities we have in our distribution network for chemicals  fertilizer  and seed 
where our data indicates an opportunity  we have the potential to add sales personnel and or locations and assets to fill in gaps in our coverage 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we acquired two retail locations from independent distributors 
both locations were identified as part of our gaps analysis strategy and will expand our network to customers we were not previously serving 
we will continue to analyze and pursue additional acquisition candidates as appropriate opportunities arise in line with our strategy 
fertilizer and seed revenue growth we have experienced revenue growth in both of these product areas and believe there are continued growth opportunities going forward 
as seed varieties continue to be enhanced through biotechnology  we believe they will serve as a growth platform due to the increased value added nature of their sale to the customer 
we intend to leverage our growth in the seed business through advanced technical training of our sales force  hiring and strategically placing experienced salespeople  using incentive compensation plans incorporating seed specific performance goals  nurturing our relationships with our seed suppliers  and targeting new retail and wholesale opportunities to enhance our sales presence in regions where gaps exist 
we will also leverage our growth in the fertilizer business by nurturing relationships with fertilizer suppliers and by making modest investments in storage and blending facilities in regions where gaps exist 
proprietary and private label business our proprietary and private label products offer higher gross margins than the supplier branded products we sell 
we currently market over proprietary branded products and have a broad proprietary product offering in each of our core product areas  including professional non crop 
we continue to work with nearly all of our key suppliers on additional private label opportunities 
working capital and expense management we believe we are well positioned to continue to improve the financial performance of our business 
we monitor performance regularly on key operating statistics such as 
table of contents inventory efficiency  credit  operating expenses  gross profit generation  and overall return on invested capital 
this information will continue to enable us to manage expenses and reduce average levels of working capital as a percent of net sales by concentrating on the following earlier collection of supplier rebates  extending payable terms with key suppliers  continuing inventory efficiencies through sku reduction efforts and centralized purchasing  evaluating our suppliers on a total return basis including working capital management  continuing to focus on credit policies and procedures to maximize profitability  and using competition and best practices among our operating divisions to drive overall focus on working capital and expense management that are tied to variable compensation plans 
company performance measures our management uses a number of metrics and key performance indicators kpis to assess and track our financial and operational performance 
our operating managers performances are judged using our defined kpis and compared with their peers when determining achievement towards company targets 
incentive compensation is tied to achieving our kpi goals 
because of the seasonal nature of our business  we view all of our kpis on a rolling month average basis 
our current kpis were developed by our management team in fiscal and have been utilized and refined since that time 
the four most important kpis that we measure are the following product mix we define product mix as the percentage of agricultural chemical products sold from each of our suppliers brands  including our proprietary and private label brands 
expense coverage ratio expense coverage ratio measures the ratio of total gross profit to total operating expenses excluding bad debt and interest expense 
it is a measure that quantifies the efficiency of a dollar spent on operating expenses 
average trade working capital as a percentage of net sales average trade working capital as a percent of sales represents the twelve month average of working capital excluding cash and short term debt divided by the twelve month total of net sales 
as a sub set of average trade working capital we also have kpis established for days sales on hand  days inventory on hand  and days payables on hand 
pre tax return on invested capital pre tax return on invested capital is an all encompassing kpi that measures our pre tax return in percentage terms on our invested capital  defined as our average trade working capital plus long term assets such as net property  plant and equipment and other investments 
factors impacting our results in fiscal year during fiscal  several events took place that had or may have an impact on our business including the following hurricanes katrina and rita have impacted industries in numerous ways 
the agricultural inputs distribution industry has seen an impact on several fronts 
following the hurricanes  the prices of diesel fuel and gasoline spiked to record high levels at the time 
as a result  we experienced approximately a increase in our fuel expenses  or million  on comparable gallons during our third and fourth quarters compared to the same period last year 
for the full fiscal year  our total fuel expenses were higher by approximately  or million  compared to last year 
natural gas prices also increased dramatically following the hurricanes due to supply concerns 
natural gas is a key ingredient in the manufacturing of nitrogen based fertilizer 
nitrogen based fertilizers such as anhydrous ammonia  urea  and uan solutions  experienced dramatic price increases per ton 
the high per ton prices  along with greater volume  increased fertilizer sales during the third and fourth quarters 
however  the higher costs per ton diluted our gross margin percentage on sales as we generally price to a fixed profit amount per ton 
on september   we announced a restructuring of our organization and management 
as part of this restructuring  we consolidated ten of our regional distribution organizations into five 
we also 
table of contents closed one regional finance center  further centralizing and consolidating various accounting and administrative functions 
as part of this restructuring  approximately employees located throughout the united states were terminated 
expenses related to this restructuring for the year totaled million 
we estimate that million remains to be expensed before this restructuring is completed during fiscal during the second half of fiscal  we completed the expansion of our fertilizer terminal in quincy  illinois 
we expect this mississippi river terminal to contribute to our goal of increased fertilizer sales to our existing and new customers because of its additional capacity and strategic location in the midwestern corn belt 
this facility expansion was first identified as an opportunity through a gaps analysis of our existing fertilizer distribution network 
please review the section results of operations below for a more detailed explanation of our financial and operational performance 
recent developments on february   we sold our retail locations in western canada to jri limited 
we will continue to supply jri limited with agricultural inputs per a supply agreement negotiated as part of the sale 
this sale had no impact on our fiscal results of operations and we expect the impact to fiscal to be negligible 
on march   we purchased the remaining share of our joint venture in uap timberland 
this purchase had no impact on our fiscal results of operations 
starting with the first quarter of fiscal  our accounting treatment of uap timberland will change from the equity method previous to fiscal to being consolidated into our results of operations 
in fiscal  million of our income from the royalties  service charges and other income and expenses category was from the unconsolidated earnings of our affiliate uap timberland 
see note in notes to financial statements 
on may   uap holding corp 
and united agri products commenced tender offers for the outstanding senior discount notes and the outstanding senior notes  respectively 
in connection with the tender offers  the companies are also soliciting consents from the holders of the notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants in the indentures under which the notes were issued 
the consummation of the tender offers and consent solicitations are subject to a number of conditions 
in addition  united agri products intends to replace its existing revolving credit facility and enter into a new senior secured term loan facility  the proceeds of which will be used to pay the tender offer consideration and related expenses  and for general corporate purposes 
on may   united agri products  entered into a commitment letter with two financial institutions who agreed to provide and syndicate the amended credit facilities

shipments of monsanto bulk herbicides increased compared to the prior year 
we now invoice these sales directly  which during the first two quarters of fiscal were commissioned agent transactions 
higher volumes of glyphosate herbicides more than offset lower end user unit prices for glyphosate products  while insecticide and fungicide treatments increased compared to fiscal due to an increase in disease and insect infestations 

table of contents sales of fertilizer rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was driven by higher pricing  combined with slightly higher volumes as wet weather during the fall fertilizer application season in late fiscal delayed the timing of some fall fertilizer application to early fiscal additionally  a better fall fertilizer season in fiscal  especially in the upper midwest geography  contributed to the volume increase compared last year 
sales of seed rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to volume growth on both third party and proprietary brands and higher prices due to increased sales of seed with enhanced traits 
volume gains were achieved in the two major crops of corn and cotton 
sales of proprietary chemical and seed products were of total chemical and seed sales in fiscal versus in fiscal sales of other products increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to higher application fee revenue  which was partially due to the delayed fertilizer season from the fall of fiscal to the spring of fiscal increased transportation revenue from our canadian and upper midwest locations also contributed to the increase in other sales compared to last year

at the acquisition  the inventory on our books was written up million to fair market value 
as this inventory was sold  it increased cost of goods sold by million in fiscal additionally  gross profit increased due to increased proprietary product sales  on which we earn a much higher gross margin  as well as growth in all other categories  most notably seed 
the overall gross margin percentage increase was moderated by higher costs for fertilizer nutrients and fuel prices 
gross profit includes supplier rebates  which are accrued monthly based on actual sales at the most likely estimated rates by supplier  then adjusted as necessary  typically in our third and fourth quarters 
see the discussion in critical accounting policies and estimates titled vendor rebate receivables for a further discussion of the factors involved in our rebate accruals 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to of sales during fiscal compared to of sales during fiscal the increase in dollars spent was due to higher professional expenses associated with becoming an independent public company  higher insurance costs  fewer recoveries of bad debts  and increased vehicle expenses including fuel  partially offset by one extra week in fiscal year the sg a expenses in fiscal included million of management fees paid to apollo

sales increased to  million in the fifty three weeks ended february  fiscal  compared to  million for the fifty two weeks ended february  fiscal 
sales of chemicals increased to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to gains in chemical sales gains in the midsouth  southwest  and southeast regions  and a change in the way monsanto bills its bulk herbicide business 
offsetting these gains were lower professional non crop sales  lower chemical tolling revenue due to the rationalization of several non strategic formulation facilities that provided toll manufacturing services  lower sales in our canadian business as they focused on higher margin proprietary products  and lower prices on glyphosate

volume gains were achieved in the three major crops of corn  soybeans  and cotton

table of contents sales of other products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the rationalization of feed product lines which were integrated into several retail and wholesale locations in montana in fiscal slightly lower application fee revenue in fiscal versus fiscal  due to the delayed fertilizer season  also contributed to lower sales of other products 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal at the acquisition  due to purchase accounting  the inventory on our books was written up million to fair market value

sales of stock from the rabbi trust in the common stock offering also qualified as compensation expense for federal and state income tax purposes  but did not generate a permanent tax difference for financial reporting purposes 
instead  for financial reporting purposes the tax effect of the aggregate difference between the price at which a share of our common stock was initially credited to the rabbi trust and the price at which such share of our common stock was subsequently distributed from the rabbi trust in the common stock offering was credited to additional paid in capital 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal 
in general  sales and operating income are highest during the first and second quarters which represent peak months in the planting and growing seasons of crops in the united states and canada 
sales are substantially lower during the third and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses 
in fiscal and fiscal  greater than of our net sales and greater than of our net income were generated in the first and second quarters of the year 
we typically have a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the fourth quarter in anticipation of the peak selling season 
because of our high accounts receivable balances and payments to suppliers for inventory sold during the first and second quarters  our peak borrowing usually occurs during the third quarter 
our peak accounts receivable collections and advances from customers typically occur in the third and fourth quarters following the harvest of our customer s annual crop 

table of contents the following tables present certain quarterly data for fiscal years and we have included income statement and balance sheet data as well as sales by product category for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts 
in our opinion  this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
due to the seasonal nature of the agricultural inputs industry  the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current cash needs 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following cash flows generated from operating activities  the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  dividend payments  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  consisting primarily of receivables  inventories  prepaid expenses  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses  capital expenditures  debt service  and dividends on our common stock 
we will fund our liquidity needs  including dividend payments  with cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we expect to fund any growth capital expenditures with cash generated from operations  reductions in working capital  and incremental debt 
as of february   we had no balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility compared to million outstanding balance at february  the revolving credit facility is included in our financial statements as short term debt 
we believe that our cash flows from operating activities and borrowing capabilities under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future  including funding of capital expenditures  debt service payments  and our intended dividend payments on our common stock 
if our cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund dividend payments at intended levels  we will need to reduce or eliminate dividends or  to the extent we are permitted to do so under our debt agreements  fund dividends with borrowings or from other sources 
if we use working capital or permanent borrowings to fund dividends  we will have less cash available for future dividends and other purposes  which could negatively impact our financial condition  our results of operations  and our ability to maintain or expand our business 
additionally  our revolving credit facility will mature in if we are unable to refinance such indebtedness prior to its stated maturity  we will be required to use cash to repay such indebtedness  and we may not have sufficient cash available to us at that time 
even if we have sufficient cash  such a repayment would sufficiently decrease the amount of cash  if any  that is available to pay dividends 
historical cash flows prior to fiscal  the conagra agricultural products business sources of cash were primarily cash flows from operations and advances received from conagra foods 
as a result of the acquisition  our ongoing operations require availability of funds to service debt  fund working capital and meet capital expenditure requirements 
we currently finance and expect to continue to finance these activities through cash flows from operations and from amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
the information presented for fiscal has been derived by combining the cash flow activity of the successor for the thirteen weeks ended february   with the cash flow activity of the predecessor for the thirty nine weeks ended november  
table of contents cash flows provided by used in operating activities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal fiscal net cash flow provided by operations was driven by net income of million and a reduction of prepayments to suppliers of million 
cash flow benefits in fiscal were partially offset by uses of cash primarily due to increases in inventory purchases and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
fiscal cash used in operations was due primarily to an increase in prepayments made to suppliers of million as well as increased purchases of inventory of million and increases in accounts receivable of million 
these cash uses were partially offset by cash provided by increased accounts payable and other current liabilities of million  and net income of million 
fiscal cash provided by operations was due primarily to a reduction of prepayments to suppliers of million  inventory reductions related to the acquisition of million and net income of million 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal additions to property  plant and equipment were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million for fiscal during fiscal  we completed various projects related to acquisitions and the expansion of our business totaling approximately million  while the remaining spending was for infrastructure replacement  cost reduction  and computer hardware and software projects 
most notably  we acquired two distribution locations from two independent distributors during our fourth fiscal quarter and we also completed the expansion of our mississippi river fertilizer terminal in quincy  illinois in the fall of calendar comparatively in fiscal  most of our large capital expenditures were for transition projects to enable our separation from our former parent  conagra foods  and for our subsystem replacement project  which we continued to roll out on a phased approach by geography and completed in fiscal the post closing settlement to conagra foods in june accounted for million of the investing activity in fiscal the high level of cash used in investing activities in fiscal was due to the acquisition 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal represent million of cash dividends on our common stock  slightly offset by the change in our check float on zero balance accounts compared to fiscal we actively manage our cash balances which results in check float on zero balance accounts 
cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal reflect approximately million of net proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses received from the primary issuance of our common stock on november   which was offset by a million special dividend to common stockholders paid on october   redemption of million of preferred stock from conagra foods during fiscal  and a million redemption of senior notes on december  cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal included the contribution of equity by apollo and issuance of long term debt in connection with the acquisition 
financing activities in fiscal  prior to the acquisition period  were primarily limited to net investments by conagra foods and bank overdrafts 
credit facility and other long term debt 
in connection with the acquisition  united agri products entered into a five year million asset based revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for a million revolving credit sub facility for united agri products canada inc uap canada and a million letter of credit sub facility 
at february   there was million of total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and united agri products had aggregate borrowing availability thereunder of million after giving effect to million of letters of credit under the sub facility 
on november   the revolving credit facility was amended and restated in connection with the consummation of the common stock offering 
the interest rates with respect to revolving loans under the revolving credit facility  as amended and restated  are based  at united agri products option  on either the agent s index rate plus an applicable index margin of between and or upon libor plus an applicable libor margin of between and 
as of the date of this report  the applicable index margin is and the applicable libor margin is 

table of contents united agri products also pays an unused line fee margin of between and multiplied by the difference between x the maximum amount of the revolving credit facility as it may be reduced from time to time and y the average daily balance of revolving loans for the preceding months 
these applicable margins are in each case subject to prospective adjustment on a quarterly basis due to a change in the company s ratio of funded debt to ebitda on a consolidated basis 
following an event of default  all amounts owing under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate otherwise applicable thereto plus an additional 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are or  in the case of future subsidiaries  will be guaranteed by uap holding corp 
and each of its existing and future direct and indirect us subsidiaries 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on or security interest in  subject to certain exceptions  substantially all of uap holding corp 
s  united agri products  and uap canada s properties and assets and the properties and assets of each of the other guarantors 
the revolving credit facility contains customary representations  warranties  covenants  and events of default 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  the amount of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility varies significantly throughout our fiscal year 
during fiscal  outstanding borrowings net of cash on hand reached a period end peak of million on october   while cash on hand reached a period end peak of million with no borrowings under the revolving credit facility on february  our average period end borrowings net of cash on hand for fiscal were approximately million 
as of february   we were in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facility

capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal  compared to in fiscal  and million in fiscal during fiscal  we completed various projects related to acquisitions and the expansion of our business totaling approximately million  while the remaining spending was for infrastructure replacement  cost reduction  and computer hardware and software projects 
most notably  we acquired two distribution locations from two independent distributors during our fourth fiscal quarter and we also completed the expansion of our mississippi river fertilizer terminal in quincy  illinois in the fall of calendar comparatively in fiscal  most of our large capital expenditures were for transition projects to enable our separation from our former parent  conagra  and for our subsystem replacement project  which we continued to roll out on a phased approach by geography and completed in fiscal we expect we will finance all capital expenditures with cash generated from operations  reductions in working capital  or incremental debt 
holding company as a holding company  our investments in our operating subsidiaries  including united agri products  constitute substantially all of our operating assets 
consequently  our subsidiaries conduct all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our operating assets 
our principal source of the cash required to pay our and our subsidiaries obligations and to repay the principal amount of our and our subsidiaries obligations  including the senior discount notes  is the cash that our subsidiaries generate from their operations and our borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligations to make funds available to us 
the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness generally restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends  making loans or other distributions  and otherwise transferring assets to us 
furthermore  our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes and senior discount notes to incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the making of distributions  the payment of dividends  or the making of loans by such subsidiaries to us 
we cannot assure you that the agreements governing our current and future indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions  or loans to fund scheduled interest and principal payments on our indebtedness when due 
if we consummate an acquisition  our debt service requirements could increase 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

table of contents dividend policy see the table in item labeled dividend history  which outlines our dividend history since the acquisition 
we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock at an annual rate of per share 
on april   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock in the amount of per share of common stock 
the record date for the dividend payment was may   and the payment date will be june  there are no assurances that we will declare or pay any cash dividends in the future 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock is at the discretion of our board of directors and depends upon many factors including our financial condition  earnings  legal requirements  restrictions in our debt agreements  and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
the terms of our indebtedness  including the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior discount notes  may also restrict us from paying cash dividends on our common stock under some circumstances 
as of february   approximately million of permitted distributions were available to pay dividends under our restricted payment covenant in our indenture governing the senior discount notes before giving effect to the march  dividend payment of million and before the anticipated june  dividend payment estimated to be million 
in the past  cash flow from our operating activities has been highly variable  resulting in negative cash flow during certain periods 
because of the variability  if our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to fund dividend payments at intended levels  we may need to reduce or eliminate dividends or  to the extent permitted by our debt agreements  fund all or part of the dividends with additional debt or other sources of cash 
to the extent we pay dividends  the amount of cash available to us to pay principal of  and interest on  our outstanding debt will be reduced 
a failure to pay principal of  or interest on  our debt would constitute an event of default under the applicable debt agreements giving the holders of the debt the right to accelerate its maturity 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient cash available to repay it in full and we may be unable to refinance it on satisfactory terms or at all 
an event of default under debt agreements  or an acceleration of the debt hereunder  could also trigger an event of default under other debt agreements 
furthermore  if we fund dividends with additional debt  our interest expense will increase which may cause a further reduction in the amount of cash available to us 
subject to certain restrictions in the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior discount notes  that additional debt could be secured and therefore effectively be senior to the senior notes and the senior discount notes 
trading activities as of february   and february   we had no outstanding derivative contracts 
however  subject to limitations set forth in our debt agreements  we may  in the future  enter into derivative contracts to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and the accompanying note disclosures 
the estimates made by management are based on historical experience combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and 
table of contents those for which changes in the estimates  judgments  or assumptions  or the use of different estimates  judgments  and assumptions  could have a material impact on our consolidated and combined results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates  those which are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective  complex  or significant judgment on the part of management  are the following allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and reserves  and vendor rebate receivables 
for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note in notes to financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects reserves against customer receivables  reducing customer receivables to net amounts expected to be collected 
management uses significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts  taking into consideration factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical customer performance  and anticipated customer performance 
we estimate uncollectible receivables as a percentage of net sales based on our historical bad debt experience and establish a general reserve accrual as sales are made 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted based on credit evaluations of specific customer receivables  taking into account a variety of factors  including customer credit worthiness  past payment performance  changes in a customer s ability to meet their financial commitments  and any collateral that we hold 
we also make adjustments if additional information or collateral from the customer substantiates the basis for a change 
additionally  some customers may have insurance that is assigned to us in the event of crop disasters and there may also be government disaster payments 
while we have a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  our business is seasonal  like our customers businesses  and is based on crop specific planting  growing  and harvesting needs 
a decrease in crop yields and or commodity prices in the markets in which we operate may result in higher than expected uncollectible accounts  and therefore we may need to revise estimates for doubtful accounts 
to the extent that our historical credit experience is not indicative of future performance or other assumptions used by management do not prevail  the allowance for doubtful accounts could differ significantly  resulting in either higher or lower future provisions or credits for doubtful accounts 
management believes our processes effectively address our exposure for doubtful accounts 
however  changes in the economy  industry  or specific customer conditions may require adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded by us 
inventory valuation and reserves 
inventory consists primarily of chemicals  fertilizer  and seed products purchased from our suppliers for resale to our customers 
we record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system  which we reconcile to physical counts at each location periodically 
our inventory reserves are comprised of a reserve for vendor rebates and a reserve for slow moving or obsolete inventory 
our vendor rebate reserve relates to our vendor rebates receivable  see vendor rebate receivables below 
we account for rebates as a reduction of the prices of the supplier s products and therefore as a reserve against inventory valuation until we sell the product  at which time such rebates reduce cost of goods sold in our income statement and the reserve against inventory is equally reduced 
as of february   and 
table of contents february   we had million and million  respectively  of reserves against inventory valuation related to rebates paid on purchases which had not yet been sold and therefore unearned 
each fiscal quarter  we analyze our company wide inventory against historical sales of inventory products to determine whether individual items are obsolete or slow moving 
a reserve is then established based on this analysis 
the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit 
as of february   and february   we had million and million  respectively  of reserves against inventory related to slow moving and obsolete inventory items 
in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory we consider a combination of factors  including but not limited to the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales by product based on product sales at both the geographic region and company levels  the product s registration status with state and federal authorities  our ability to return excess or obsolete inventory items to our suppliers in exchange for credit or other more salable products  the impact of favorable or unfavorable weather conditions  insect pressures  or plant disease outbreaks on a product s usage during the most recent growing season  the product s shelf life or expiration date  changes in customer preferences due to new  improved  or competing products  and geographical location 
our reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory requires significant management judgement and may periodically require adjustment as changes in the above factors occur 
vendor rebate receivables 
we account for rebates in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
at the beginning of each crop year  we enter into agreements with many of our suppliers providing for rebates upon the achievement of specified volume purchasing or sales levels 
most of these rebates are covered by binding arrangements or published programs 
rebates that are probable and reasonably estimable are accrued at expected rates based on total estimated crop year performance 
rebates that are not probable or estimable are accrued when certain milestones are achieved 
rebates not covered by binding agreements or published vendor programs are accrued when conclusive documentation of right of receipt is obtained 
by the fiscal year end  we have received substantially all of the rebates due us for the prior crop year  and rebate income is adjusted accordingly 
we accrue rebates as part of our cost of sales  primarily for chemical and seed products 
historically  more than of the rebates earned were from our chemical suppliers 
as of february   rebates receivable are for the current crop year  which began as early as september and may end as late as january  depending on the supplier 
rebates based on the amount of materials purchased are offset in cost of goods sold as inventory is sold 
rebates that are based on the amount of sales volume are offset to cost of goods sold when earned based on our experience with the supplier and our anticipated sales volume of the supplier s products 
due to the nature of rebate programs  estimates of rebates earned can vary significantly from period to period  and when comparing interim periods of the current and prior year  and more likely than not will trail sales 
due to a combination of factors as compared to last year  including changes in vendor programs  the company s new rebate tracking system  and improved operating performance that led to a greater probability of achieving higher rebate levels  the company accrued a larger proportion of rebate earnings earlier in fiscal 
table of contents as compared to fiscal because of the nature of rebate programs and the amount of rebates available are determined by our suppliers  there can be no assurance that historical rebate trends will continue 
off balance sheet arrangements we use off balance sheet arrangements eg operating leases where the economics and sound business principles warrant their use 
we periodically enter into letters of credit and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of our business 
for information  see obligations and commitments above 
related party transactions as part of the acquisition  we entered into a seller transition services agreement with conagra foods pursuant to which we would perform certain information technology  accounting  office support  and other services for conagra foods 
in addition  we granted to conagra foods and its international subsidiaries an exclusive two year license to use certain of our trademarks and trade names outside the united states and canada 
conagra foods paid us an aggregate fee of million during fiscal for the license and the services provided by us under the seller transition services agreement 
the seller transition services agreement was terminated by conagra foods on september   other than with respect to the license to conagra foods to use certain of our trademarks and trade names 
the license to use certain of our trademarks and trade names was extended through november   by letter agreement dated march   between conagra foods  uap holding corp  and united agri products  inc as part of the acquisition  we and conagra foods entered into a buyer transition services agreement pursuant to which conagra foods would provide certain information technology and other administrative services to us for a period of one year 
as consideration for these services  we paid conagra foods a non accountable charge of million  million of which was recognized in fiscal for the year ended february   million in expense was recognized by us for the non accountable charges 
additional services were provided on a fee for usage basis of million for services during the transition and are accounted for in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the buyer transition services agreement expired on november   in accordance with its terms 
prior to the acquisition  expenses incurred by conagra foods and allocated to us were determined based on the specific services that were provided or were allocated based on conagra foods investment in us in proportion to conagra foods total investment in its subsidiaries 
in addition  conagra foods charged us finance charges on conagra foods investment in and advances to us 
management believes that such expense allocations were reasonable 
it is not practical to estimate the expenses that would have been incurred by us if we had operated on a stand alone basis 
corporate allocations included allocated selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the thirty nine weeks ending november  allocated finance charges were million for the thirty nine weeks ending november  under the terms of a management consulting agreement the management agreement dated as of november   between united agri products  inc and apollo  united agri products  inc 
retained apollo to provide certain management consulting and financial advisory services  for which united agri products  inc paid apollo an annual management fee of million  paid quarterly in fiscal in connection with the common stock offering  the management agreement was terminated and united agri products  inc paid apollo a million transaction fee on november  as of november   apollo owned approximately of uap holding corp 
s outstanding common stock 
following the consummation of the common stock offering on november   apollo owned approximately of uap holding corp 
s outstanding common stock 
as of march   following a secondary offering transaction  apollo owned approximately of uap holding corp 
s outstanding common stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks affecting our business are exposure to changes in energy prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in energy prices have a direct impact on our fuel costs 
the national average per gallon spot price of diesel fuel increased from approximately to and the spot price of gasoline increased from approximately to as of february   and february   respectively 
these price increases impact our supply chain and selling expenses 
based on our usage mix of these two fuels  we estimate that on average we have experienced a price increase in fuel costs year over year 
combined with a small percentage increase in gallons used during fiscal  our expenses related to fuel were up million compared to the prior year 
based on our historic usage  a increase in the annual average per gallon price of fuel would increase our fuel expense by million 
higher fuel prices also affect our customers such that higher expenses for fuel and higher prices for fertilizer inputs may reduce the cash or credit available to our customers with which they purchase other inputs or services from us 
our on hand inventory of fertilizer products has price risk related to changes in energy prices 
our total fertilizer inventories on hand were approximately million and million as of february   and february   respectively 
of our total fertilizer inventory approximately million and million as of february   and february   respectively  were considered by the fertilizer industry to be nitrogen based and therefore more price sensitive to the price of natural gas 
natural gas is the key ingredient in the manufacture of these products 
while a direct relationship cannot be established due to alternative sources of fertilizer products  such as imports  or substitute products  price risk does exist 
our average period end borrowings under the revolving credit agreement net of cash on hand for fiscal were approximately million 
the revolving credit facility is affected by changes in interest rates 
based upon the amount of our average period end borrowings net of cash on hand for fiscal  a one percentage point change in the assumed weighted average interest rate on such credit facility would change our annual interest expense by million 
our foreign currency risk is limited primarily to the exchange rate differential in the canadian and us dollar 
the exchange rate was and at february   and february   respectively 
the exchange rate varied between and during fiscal a change in the exchange rate would have approximately a million impact on the balance sheet value
