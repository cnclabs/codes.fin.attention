item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facility and note to our consolidated financial statements 
marketing our production is marketed to third parties consistent with industry practices 
we market our own production where feasible  but on occasion engage a third party marketing agent 
typically  oil is sold at the well head at field posted prices and natural gas is sold under contract at a negotiated monthly price based upon factors normally considered in the industry  such as conditioning or treating to make gas marketable  distance from the well to the transportation pipeline  well pressure  estimated reserves  quality of natural gas and prevailing supply demand conditions 
our marketing objective is to receive the highest possible wellhead price for our product 
we are aided by the presence of multiple outlets near our production on the gulf coast 
we take an active role in determining the available pipeline alternatives for each property based upon historical pricing  capacity  pressure  market relationships  seasonal variances and long term viability 
there are a variety of factors which affect the market for oil and natural gas  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas  the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  demand for oil and natural gas  the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulations on oil and natural gas production and sales 
we have not experienced any significant difficulties in marketing our oil and natural gas 
the oil and natural gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial  commercial and individual customers 
where feasible  we use a combination of market sensitive pricing and forward fixed pricing 
forward pricing is utilized to take advantage of anomalies in the futures market and to hedge a portion of our production at prices exceeding forecast 
all such hedging transactions provide for financial rather than physical settlement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates derivatives and hedging activities 
due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements may limit our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also reduces our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
our price risk management arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  apply to only a portion of our production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit our potential gains from future increases in prices 
on an ongoing basis  our management reviews all of our price risk management transaction policies  including volumes  accounting treatment  types of instruments and counter parties 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation with and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
our board of directors reviews our price risk management policies and trades 
we account for these transactions as hedging and derivative activities and  accordingly  certain gains and losses are included in revenue during the period the transactions occur see note to our consolidated financial statements 
although we take some measures to attempt to control price risk  we remain subject to price fluctuations for natural gas sold in the spot market due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
domestic oil prices generally follow worldwide oil prices  which are subject to price fluctuations resulting from changes in world supply and demand 
we continue to evaluate the potential for reducing these risks by entering into hedge transactions

the fair value of our outstanding transactions is presented on the balance sheet by counterparty 
our counterparties net our positions with them  but we cannot present the net of the two counterparty positions because we do not have legal right of offset 
therefore one counterparty is presented in the derivative asset and one is presented in the derivative liability 
the crude oil collar with a balance of  is presented as a liability and the remaining contracts are presented as an asset 
all contracts are considered current 
sales to major customers we sold natural gas and crude oil production representing or more of our total revenues for the years ended december    and as listed below 
for the year ended december  purchaser kinder morgan chevrontexaco copano field services upstream energy services bta zero or less than upstream energy services is an agent that sells our production to other purchasers on our behalf 
note amounts disclosed are approximations and those that are less than are presented for information and comparison purposes only 
also these percentages do not consider the effects of financial hedges 
in the exploration  development and production business  production is normally sold to relatively few customers 
substantially all of the company s customers are concentrated in the oil and gas industry  and revenue can be materially affected by current economic conditions and the price of certain commodities such as natural gas and crude oil  the cost of which is passed through to the customer 
however  based on the current demand for natural gas and crude oil and the fact that alternate purchasers are readily available  we believe that the loss of any of our major purchasers would not have a long term material adverse effect on our operations 
competition we compete with other oil and natural gas companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties 
our ability to explore for oil and natural gas reserves and to acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to conduct our operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
we believe that our technological expertise  our exploration  land  drilling and production capabilities and the experience of our management generally enable us to compete effectively 
see item a 
risk factors we face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies 
industry regulations the availability of a ready market for oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of oil and natural gas production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by well or proration unit  the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas  protect rights to produce oil and natural gas between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of oil and natural gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies 
we are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
the following discussion summarizes the regulation of the united states oil and natural gas industry 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject  although there can be no assurance that this is or will remain the case 
moreover  such statutes  rules  regulations and government orders may be changed or reinterpreted from time to time in response to economic or political conditions  and there can be no assurance that such changes or reinterpretations will not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the following discussion is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of the various statutes  rules  regulations and governmental orders to which our operations may be subject 
regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in areas where pooling is voluntary  it may be more difficult to form units  and therefore more difficult to develop a project  if the operator owns less than of the leasehold 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
the effect of these regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our costs of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
inasmuch such laws and regulations are frequently expanded  amended and interpreted  we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
regulation of sales and transportation of natural gas 
federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of natural gas produced by us  and the manner in which such production is transported and marketed 
under the natural gas act nga of  the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates the interstate transportation and the sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas 
effective january   the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas  including all sales by us of our own production 
as a result  all of our domestically produced natural gas may now be sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect 
however  the decontrol act did not affect the ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation 
under the provisions of the energy policy act of  the nga has been amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas  and the ferc has issued new regulations to implement this prohibition 
in addition  under the act the ferc has been directed to establish new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency through  among other things  expanded dissemination of information about the availability and prices of gas sold 
the act also has significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga 
our natural gas sales are affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation 
following the congressional passage of the ngpa  the ferc adopted a series of regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
beginning with the adoption of order no 
 issued in october  the ferc has implemented a series of major restructuring orders that have required pipelines  among other things  to perform open access transportation of gas for others  unbundle their sales and transportation functions  and allow shippers to release their unneeded capacity temporarily and permanently to other shippers 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties 
we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while  at the same time  substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
it remains to be seen  however  what effect the ferc s other activities will have on access to markets  the fostering of competition and the cost of doing business 
we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt  or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any such new or different regulations materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete 
in the past  congress has been very active in the area of gas regulation 
however  as discussed above  the more recent trend has been in favor of deregulation  or lighter handed regulation  and the promotion of competition in the gas industry 
there regularly are other legislative proposals pending in the federal and state legislatures that  if enacted  would significantly affect the petroleum industry 
at the present time  it is impossible to predict what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect  if any  such proposals might have on us 
similarly  and despite the trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry  whether or to what extent that trend will continue  or what the ultimate effect will be on our sales of gas  cannot be predicted 
again  we do not believe that we will be affected by any such new legislative proposals materially differently than any other seller of natural gas with which we compete 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the standards the ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to ferc jurisdiction under the nga 
these gathering facilities are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and or by state regulatory agencies 
in  the dot implemented regulations requiring that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of certain pipeline facilities within ten years  and at least every seven years thereafter 
in addition  beginning in early  the dot s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration commenced a rulemaking proceeding to develop rules that would better distinguish onshore gathering lines from production facilities and transmission lines  and to develop safety requirements better tailored to gathering line risks 
we are not able to predict with certainty the final outcome of this rulemaking proposal 
in addition to safety regulation  state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various environmental  and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but does not generally entail rate regulation 
natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory rate and service scrutiny at the state level in the post restructuring environment 
oil price controls and transportation rates 
sales of crude oil  condensate and gas liquids by us are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the price we receive from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market 
much of the transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines 
effective as of january   the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
the ferc s regulation of oil transportation rates may tend to increase the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipelines  although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year 
every five years  the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry 
the second of these required reviews was commenced in july  where the ferc has proposed to continue use of the indexing methodology for a further five year period 
we are not able at this time to predict the effects of these regulations  if any  on the transportation costs associated with oil production from our oil producing operations 
environmental regulations 
our operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as pit closure and plugging abandoned wells  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from production and drilling operations 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations applied to the oil and natural gas industry could continue  resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability 
to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly waste handling  disposal and cleanup requirements  our business and prospects could be adversely affected 
we generate wastes that may be subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
the us environmental protection agency epa and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes 
furthermore  certain wastes generated by our oil and natural gas operations that are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes  and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
we currently own or lease numerous properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas 
although we believe that we have used good operating and waste disposal practices  prior owners and operators of these properties may not have used similar practices  and hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  rcra and analogous state laws as well as state laws governing the management of oil and natural gas wastes 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
our operations may be subject to the clean air act caa and comparable state and local requirements 
amendments to the caa were adopted in and contain provisions that have resulted in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations 
the epa and states developed and continue to develop regulations to implement these requirements 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals addressing other air emission related issues 
however  we do not believe our operations will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements 
federal regulations require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil  such as edge  to prepare and implement spill prevention  control  countermeasure spcc and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters 
spcc plans at our producing properties were developed and implemented in the oil pollution act of opa contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states 
the opa subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill  including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters 
noncompliance with opa may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities 
our operations are also subject to the federal clean water act cwa and analogous state laws 
in accordance with the cwa  the state of louisiana has issued regulations prohibiting discharges of produced water in state coastal waters effective july  like opa  the cwa and analogous state laws relating to the control of water pollution provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground 
cercla  also known as the superfund law  and similar state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we also are subject to a variety of federal  state and local permitting and registration requirements relating to protection of the environment 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us 
operating hazards and insurance the oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks  including the risk of fire  explosion  blow out  pipe failure  casing collapse  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills  natural gas leaks  ruptures and discharges of toxic gases  the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution or other environmental damage  cleanup responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
our insurance does not cover business interruption or protect against loss of revenue 
there can be no assurance that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities 
we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance or the availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
item a 
risk factors oil and gas drilling is a speculative activity and involves numerous risks and substantial and uncertain costs which could adversely affect us 
our growth will be materially dependent upon the success of our future drilling program 
drilling for oil and gas involves numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment 
our future drilling activities may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline 
we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame  or at all 
we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because  in some cases  we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location 
similarly  our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget 
the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors  including the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition  review and analysis of the seismic data  the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects  the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs and crews  our financial resources and results  and the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects 
these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells  if drilled  may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive oil or natural gas 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview industry and economic factors and items and business and properties core areas of operation 
oil and natural gas prices are highly volatile in general and low prices negatively affect our financial results 
our revenue  profitability  cash flow  future growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
our reserves are predominantly natural gas  therefore changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
lower oil and natural gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and such markets are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  and ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management activities derivatives and hedging and items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserves and marketing 
we have in the past and may in the future be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or unusually volatile 
whether we will be required to take such a charge will depend on the prices for oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter and the effect of reserve additions or revisions and capital expenditures during such quarter 
if a write down is required  it would result in a charge to earnings  but would not impact cash flow from operating activities 
we have hedged and may continue to hedge a portion of our production  which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas 
in order to reduce our exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas  we periodically enter into hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
such hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected  our customers fail to purchase contracted quantities of oil or natural gas or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  our hedging arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management activities derivatives and hedging and items and business and properties marketing 
we depend on successful exploration  development and acquisitions to maintain reserves and revenue in the future 
in general  the volume of production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we acquire properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  or both  our proved reserves will decline 
our future oil and natural gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
in addition  we are dependent on finding partners for our exploratory activity 
to the extent that others in the industry do not have the financial resources or choose not to participate in our exploration activities  we could be adversely affected 
we are subject to substantial operating risks that may adversely affect the results of our operations 
the oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  mechanical failures  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution  releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks 
we could suffer substantial losses as a result of any of these events 
we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business 
we are not the operator of some of our wells 
as a result  our operating risks for those wells and our ability to influence the operations for these wells are less subject to our control 
operators of these wells may act in ways that are not in our best interests 
see items and business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  inclusion of other participants in drilling wells  and use of technology 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect us 
we depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel  including our executive officers and other key employees  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employees 
we believe that our success is also dependent upon our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled technical personnel 
see item submission of matters to a vote of security holders executive officers of the registrant and significant employees 
our operations have significant capital requirements which  if not met  will hinder operations 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital needs due to our active exploration  development and acquisition programs 
additional financing may be required in the future to fund our growth 
we may not be able to obtain such additional financing  and financing under existing or new credit facilities may not be available in the future 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
high demand for field services and equipment and the ability of suppliers to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our oil and natural gas properties 
due to current industry demands  well service providers and related equipment and personnel are in short supply 
this is causing escalating prices  delays in drilling and other exploration activities  the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries 
such pressures will likely increase the actual cost of services  extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to any accidents sustained from the over use of equipment and inexperienced personnel 
government regulation and liability for environmental matters may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal  state and local government regulations  which may be changed from time to time 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  the spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas 
there are federal  state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment applicable to the development  production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and natural gas  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations 
in addition  we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities 
we are also subject to changing and extensive tax laws  the effects of which cannot be predicted 
the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
see items and business and properties industry regulations 
we may have difficulty managing any future growth and the related demands on our resources and may have difficulty in achieving future growth 
we have experienced growth in the past through the expansion of our drilling program and  more recently  acquisitions 
this expansion was curtailed in and  but resumed in and increased in subsequent years 
further expansion is anticipated in both through increased drilling efforts and possible acquisitions 
any future growth may place a significant strain on our financial  technical  operational and administrative resources 
our ability to grow will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify and acquire new exploratory prospects  our ability to develop existing prospects  our ability to continue to retain and attract skilled personnel  the results of our drilling program and acquisition efforts  hydrocarbon prices and access to capital 
we may not be successful in achieving or managing growth and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on us 
we face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we encounter competition from oil and natural gas companies in all areas of our operations  including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties 
our competitors range in size from the major integrated oil and natural gas companies to numerous independent oil and natural gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of these competitors are large  well established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours 
we may not be able to conduct our operations successfully  evaluate and select suitable properties  consummate transactions  and obtain technical  managerial and other professional personnel in this highly competitive environment 
specifically  these larger competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects  productive oil and natural gas properties and competent personnel and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  such competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 
such competitors may also be in a better position to secure oilfield services and equipment on a timely basis or on favorable terms 
see items and business and properties competition 
the oil and natural gas reserve data included in or incorporated by reference in this document are estimates based on assumptions that may be inaccurate and existing economic and operating conditions that may differ from future economic and operating conditions 
reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner and is based upon assumptions that may vary considerably from actual results 
accordingly  reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
the information regarding discounted future net cash flows included in this report should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by financial accounting standards board in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about oil and natural gas producing activities to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
see items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserves 
our credit facility has substantial operating restrictions and financial covenants and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit  which could adversely affect operations 
over the past few years  increases in commodity prices  in proved reserve amounts and the resultant increase in estimated discounted future net revenue  has allowed us to increase our available borrowing amounts 
in the future  commodity prices may decline  we may increase our borrowings or our borrowing base may be adjusted downward 
our credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and has covenants that limit additional borrowings  sales of assets and the distributions of cash or properties and that prohibit the payment of dividends and the incurrence of liens 
the revolving credit facility also requires that specified financial ratios be maintained 
the restrictions of our credit facility and the difficulty in obtaining additional debt financing may have adverse consequences on our operations and financial results  including our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  our drilling program  purchases of new technology or other purposes 
in addition  such financing may be on terms unfavorable to us and we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities 
further  a substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements and require us to modify operations and we may become more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy generally 
our ability to obtain and service indebtedness will depend on our future performance  including our ability to manage cash flow and working capital  which are in turn subject to a variety of factors beyond our control 
our business may not generate cash flow at or above anticipated levels or we may not be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service indebtedness  make anticipated capital expenditures or finance our drilling program 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt  we may be required to curtail portions of our drilling program  sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing  particularly in view of current industry conditions  the restrictions on our ability to incur debt under our existing debt arrangements  and the fact that substantially all of our assets are currently pledged to secure obligations under our bank credit facility

we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition program may be unsuccessful 
acquisitions have become increasingly important to our business strategy in recent years 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors 
such assessments  even when performed by experienced personnel  are necessarily inexact and their accuracy inherently uncertain 
our review of subject properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems  deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not always perform inspections on every well  and may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we undertake an inspection 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of such problems 
any acquisition of property interests by us may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  such failure may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
we do not intend to pay dividends and our ability to pay dividends is restricted 
we currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business and do not currently anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we are currently restricted from paying dividends by our existing credit facility agreement 
any future dividends also may be restricted by our then existing loan agreements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our reliance on third parties for gathering and distributing could curtail future exploration and production activities 
the marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to  and the capacity of  third party facilities and services  including oil and natural gas gathering systems  pipelines  trucking or terminal facilities  and processing facilities 
the unavailability or lack of capacity of such services and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
a shut in or delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation affect our ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas on a profitable basis 
provisions of delaware law and our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that would benefit stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of the company 
these provisions  among other things  provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  restrict the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent  authorize the board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock  and restrict our ability to engage in transactions with stockholders with or more of outstanding voting stock 
because of these provisions  persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non negotiated takeover attempts 
as a result  these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors

texas comptroller audit during the second quarter of  we received notice that our franchise tax returns for the state of texas would be audited for the tax years through after reviewing documents submitted  the agent representing the office of the comptroller of the state of texas proposed adjustments to the calculation that would result in an increased franchise tax liability 
the agent maintained that transfers by the parent company to its subsidiaries that we classified as intercompany loans should instead be classified as equity investments in the subsidiary 
the state of texas originally proposed that the franchise tax liability of the subsidiaries would be increased by approximately million for the four year period under audit 
during the third quarter of  the agent reduced the proposed franchise tax deficiency adjustment to us to an aggregate of  in the fourth quarter of  there was an informal hearing at the local comptroller s office during which the agent indicated he would formally assess the proposed deficiency 
on march   we received such deficiency assessment in the amount of  including penalty and interest 
we responded on april  with a request for a formal redetermination hearing 
on february   a hearings attorney for the texas comptroller of public accounts issued a position letter reaffirming the auditor s assessment  and rejecting our arguments as set forth in our april  request for redetermination 
on february   we filed a motion to set the matter for oral hearing before an administrative law judge 
prior to the oral hearing  we will submit additional written materials to the hearings attorney 
we intend to continue to vigorously contest the assessment through appropriate administrative levels in the comptroller s office and any other available means 
due to our intention to continue to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments  we have not recognized any provision for the additional franchise taxes that would result from the proposed deficiency 
wade and joyce montet  et al  v 
edge petroleum corp of texas  et al  consolidated with rolland l 
broussard  et al  v 
edge petroleum corp of texas  et al 
this is a consolidated suit  filed in state court in vermilion parish  louisiana in september by two groups of plaintiffs against anadarko e p company  norcen explorer  inc  union pacific resources company  pan canadian petroleum corporation  japex us corporation  vale energy corporation  devon louisiana corporation and edge petroleum exploration company one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
plaintiffs are mineral royalty owners under the norcen broussard no 
and wells  marg tex reservoir c  sand unit a herein the mt rc sua  our bayou vermilion prospect 
they claim the operator at the time  norcen explorer  now anadarko  failed to block squeeze the sections of the no 
well  as would a prudent operator  to protect the gas reservoir from being flooded with water from adjacent underground formations 
plaintiffs further allege norcen was negligent in not creating a field wide unit to protect their interests 
plaintiffs have named us and other working interest owners in the leases as defendants  including norcen explorer s successors in interest  anadarko 
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages for lost royalties and damages due to alleged devaluation of their mineral and property interests  plus interest and attorneys fees 
in early  we filed a motion for summary judgment in the case asserting  among other defenses  that i there has been no breach of contract  ii there is no express or implied duty imposed on us to block squeeze the well or form a field wide unit  iii the units were properly formed by the conservation commissioner in accordance with the statutory scheme in louisiana  iv plaintiffs claims are barred by limitations  and v other defenses 
along with the other defendants  we also filed a special preemptory challenge of no cause of action under the leases and the louisiana mineral code for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and due to lack of a demand 
in may and june   the court ruled against us on the motion for summary judgment and the preemptory challenges 
of the after payout working interest that we originally reserved in the leases  we owned working interest at the time of the alleged acts or omissions 
on september   we were granted leave by the court to file a third party demand to join the other working interest owners who hold the remainder of the working interest as direct defendants in this case  and those pleadings have been served on the parties 
as of the date of this report  it is not possible to determine what  if any  our exposure might be in this matter 
the plaintiffs expert witness  in his december deposition  offered his theory that plaintiffs gross damages are in the range of to million 
that number is based on his theory that the alleged failure to block squeeze the well resulted in the under production of gas worth million 
plaintiffs royalty share of that figure yields the to million range of alleged damages 
based on the expert s testimony  damages attributable to the full interest would be in the range of million gross or net to our share would be in the range of  excluding interest and attorneys fees 
along with the other defendants  we hired our own expert witnesses who have refuted these claims  particularly the expert s assertions that failure to block squeeze the well caused any damages to the reservoir 
there is currently a trial setting in the case of may  we may have insurance coverage for all or part of this claim up to the million limits of the policy 
a claim was submitted to our casualty carrier  who is currently providing a defense under a reservation of rights letter 
we believe that we would only be liable for our share of any damage award unless a co party defendant cannot satisfy its share of any final judgment 
we intend to continue to vigorously contest this suit 
we have not established any reserve with respect to these claims

as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we completed the merger with miller in december  which affects the comparability of our results in  and subsequent periods  to prior periods 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  effective january   we changed our method of accounting for asset retirement obligations  which affects the comparability of our results in  and subsequent periods  to prior periods 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  effective january   we changed our method of accounting for derivative instruments  which affects the comparability of our results in to subsequent periods due to transition adjustments recorded in deferred compensation expense includes the non cash charge or credit related to fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
in may  certain of our outstanding options were re priced  which triggered the fin requirement of variable accounting for modifications in the terms of those stock options see note to our consolidated financial statements 
each period can be impacted by i re priced options that are exercised and ii the change in the value of outstanding repriced options based on the price of our common stock at period end 
volatility in our stock price can have a significant impact on this amount  which may affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we completed a public offering of our common stock on december  and a significant property acquisition on december   therefore certain of our results in and subsequent periods are not directly comparable to periods prior to ebitda is defined as net income loss before cumulative effect of accounting change  interest expense and amortization of deferred loan costs net of interest income and amounts capitalized  income tax expense  depletion  depreciation and amortization and accretion expense 
ebitda is a financial measure commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry  but is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap or as a measure of a company s profitability or liquidity 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  this measure may vary among companies 
the ebitda data presented above may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies 
our management believes that ebitda is a meaningful measure to investors and provides additional information about our ability to meet our future liquidity requirements for debt service  capital expenditures and working capital 
in addition  management believes that ebitda is a useful comparative measure of operating performance and liquidity 
for example  debt levels  credit ratings and  therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings vary significantly between companies 
similarly  the tax positions of individual companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits  with the result that their effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably 
finally  companies differ in the age and method of acquisition of productive assets  and thus the relative costs of those assets  as well as in the depreciation or depletion straight line  accelerated  units of production method  which can result in considerable variability in depletion  depreciation and amortization expense between companies 
thus  for comparison purposes  management believes that ebitda can be useful as an objective and comparable measure of operating profitability and the contribution of operations to liquidity because it excludes these elements 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
we do not pay cash dividends and have not in the periods presented above  therefore they are not presented in the selected financial data 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of our financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary information and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
general overview edge petroleum corporation edge  we or the company is a houston based independent energy company that focuses its exploration  development  production  acquisition and marketing activities in selected onshore basins of the united states 
in late  we undertook a top level management change and began a shift in strategy from pure exploration  which focused more on prospect generation  to our current strategy which focuses on a balanced program of exploration  exploitation and development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we generate revenues  income and cash flows by producing and marketing oil and natural gas produced from our oil and natural gas properties 
we make significant capital expenditures in our exploration  development  and acquisition activities that allow us to continue generating revenue  income and cash flows 
this overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of md a  as well as helpful hints for reading these pages 
our md a includes the following sections industry and economic factors a general description of value drivers of our business as well as opportunities  challenges and risks related to the oil and gas industry

tax matters supplementary discussion of income tax matters 
recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of certain recently issued accounting pronouncements that may impact our future results 
industry and economic factors in managing our business  we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is the fluctuation of oil and gas prices 
historically  oil and gas markets have been cyclical and volatile  which makes future price movements difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in commodity prices have most often had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
we have little ability to predict those prices or to control them without losing some advantage of the upside potential 
the oil and gas industry has experienced a high commodity price environment in  which has positively impacted the entire industry as well as our company 
although prices have begun to decrease since year end  they remain at historically high levels 
our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  we may still not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reserves being discovered 
moreover  costs associated with operating within our industry are substantial 
the recent high commodity price environment has also led to increased costs in our industry  which together with increased demand for rigs  equipment  supplies and services  have made it difficult at times for us to further our growth  and made timely execution of our planned activities difficult 
our business  as with other extractive businesses  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas businesses and individual operators in exploration  production  marketing and acquisition activities 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial and commercial end users 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to stringent operational and environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
during the third quarter  hurricanes rita and katrina hit the gulf coast causing damage to many of the platforms in the gulf of mexico  as well as numerous onshore facilities related to our industry 
as a result  both oil and natural gas prices increased in late august 
we were fortunate to avoid substantial damage or major interruptions in our production or business  but were forced to shut in several of our larger wells in mississippi due to the inability of trucks to gain access to haul the crude oil production from the wells 
we also were forced to close our corporate offices for several days to allow our houston based employees to evacuate 
approach to the business profitable growth of our business will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves of oil and natural gas in a cost effective manner 
in order to achieve an overall acceptable rate of growth  we seek to maintain a prudent blend of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins in order to mitigate risk in our operations 
we also attempt to make selected acquisitions of oil and gas properties to augment our growth and provide future drilling opportunities 
we periodically hedge our exposure to volatile oil and gas prices on a portion of our production to reduce price risk 
as of december   we have entered into hedge contracts covering approximately and of our anticipated natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  before any future acquisitions 
in  we had and of natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  hedged 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities and external sources of capital 
in recent years we have been able to expand our capital budget during the year as a result of our drilling successes and acquisition program 
our board recently approved a capital budget of approximately million 
based on current expectations for production volumes and commodity prices  we expect to fund those capital expenditures from internally generated cash from operating activities  as well as modestly reduce our debt levels 
we do not typically include acquisitions in our budgeted capital expenditures  but expect to fund those with either borrowings under our credit facility  proceeds from offerings of common stock or other securities under our shelf registration statement or other sources 
for  we reported a increase in proved reserves over the period  including the effect of the chapman ranch field acquisitions see acquisitions and divestitures below  and a increase in annual production volumes over the period 
we also replaced of our total reserves see items and business and properties oil and natural gas reserve replacement 
production in the fourth quarter of was higher than in the previous quarter and we exited with a record daily production rate of mmcfe d as compared to mmcfe d a year ago 
we believe that we are currently in a strong financial position  as represented by a debt to total capital ratio of  available unused borrowing capacity of million at december  and increased cash flow from our growing production volumes as a result of successful drilling and the chapman ranch field acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of that will help lay the ground work for our activities in operationally and financially  we believe we are well positioned to continue the execution of our business strategy during acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions we have become increasingly active in acquisitions in recent years 
we have looked to acquisitions to enable us to achieve our growth objectives and we expect acquisitions will continue to play a significant role in our future plans for growth 
acquisitions add meaningful incremental increases in reserves and production and may range in size from acquiring a working interest in non operated producing property to an entire field or company 
unlike drilling capital  which is planned and budgeted  acquisition capital is not budgeted 
specific timing of acquisitions cannot be predicted 
although we consider a wide variety of acquisitions  a significant part of our growth strategy is expected to be focused toward producing property acquisitions  which we believe have exploitable potential 
because of our financial flexibility  we are positioned to take advantage of opportunities to acquire producing properties as they may arise 
in today s high price environment  where production is providing greater cash flow and earnings to most companies in our industry  identifying quality opportunities is difficult 
we believe through hard work  technical ability and creative thinking  we will continue to grow through both acquisitions and drilling 
any such acquisition could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash or the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares or other securities 
on december   we completed our acquisition of miller exploration company miller 
miller was an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with exploration efforts concentrated primarily in the mississippi salt basin of central mississippi 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of issued and outstanding common stock of miller was converted into shares of edge common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of edge common stock to the shareholders of miller in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of miller 
the merger was treated as a tax free reorganization and accounted for as a purchase business combination under generally accepted accounting principles 
we operate the majority of the acquired properties 
we acquired miller for the development and exploitation projects in miller s core area  increased financial flexibility  and expansion of our core areas 
during  we added to the land and seismic position in mississippi acquired in the miller merger and expect to see an increase in operating activity on those properties in on october   we executed an asset purchase agreement to acquire oil and natural gas properties located in south texas from contango oil gas company contango 
the final cash purchase price for the acquisition was million  which was adjusted from the original price of million for the results of operations between the july  effective date and the december  closing date pursuant to the closing adjustment provisions 
we financed the acquisition with proceeds from a public offering of our common stock under our shelf registration see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the properties acquired consisted of non operated producing wells with working interests ranging from approximately to and net revenue interests ranging from to 
these properties  located primarily in jim hogg county  texas and producing primarily from the queen city formation  are in a geographic area that has been one of our most active and successful areas of focus in recent years 
in addition to estimated proved reserves  our technical team also identified a substantial number of additional drilling locations on undeveloped acreage for which we realized much of the exploitable potential in we view this area as a major growth area for the company in on september   we executed two separate and definitive agreements the crf agreements for the acquisition of i the stock of a private company  cinco energy corporation cinco  whose primary asset is ownership of working interests in oil and natural gas properties located on the chapman ranch field in south texas and ii additional working interests in the same field owned by two other private companies for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million of which million is attributable to the stock purchase and million is attributable to the working interest asset purchase 
we allocated approximately million of the total purchase price to the unproved property category 
the properties acquired from these entities are located in nueces county  texas and consist of eight non operated producing wells  one well undergoing completion operations  and one well shut in for evaluation  as well as an ownership in approximately  net acres of developed and undeveloped leasehold as of the closing date of november  pursuant to the crf agreements  we agreed to pay the three sellers an aggregate incremental purchase price of million of which million is attributable to the stock purchase and million is attributable to the working interest asset purchase related to the operator obtaining high cost gas certification on or before january   which would provide for severance tax abatements on the properties acquired 
the aggregate incremental purchase price was reduced to million in january because a portion of the properties did not qualify for high cost gas certification 
on november   we paid a portion of the incremental purchase price of million when a portion of the properties qualified for the certification and incurred a contingent liability for the remaining balance of million  which was paid to the sellers in the first quarter of on october   we consummated the chapman ranch field asset acquisition 
the cash base purchase price of million was adjusted to million for the incremental purchase price see above and the results of operations between the september  effective date and the october  closing date  pursuant to the closing adjustment provisions of the relevant agreement 
on november   we consummated the cinco stock purchase 
the cash base purchase price at closing of million was subject to adjustment for  among other things  working capital as of september  and an incremental purchase price see above  pursuant to the closing provisions of the relevant agreement 
the preliminarily adjusted purchase price of cinco was million 
we financed the acquisitions through borrowings under our credit facility  the borrowing base of which was increased in connection with these transactions and other recent activities since the last redetermination 
divestitures we regularly review our asset base for the purpose of identifying non core assets  the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies 
while we generally do not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt  such dispositions can have the result of furthering our objective of financial flexibility through reduced debt levels 
during  we had no divestitures 
during and  our divestitures consisted of the sales of oil and gas properties for net proceeds of  and  respectively 
our net proceeds from asset divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of certain oil and gas properties and equipment in texas  mississippi and louisiana 
our net proceeds from asset divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of our interest in two affiliated entities  essex i and ii joint ventures  and certain oil and gas properties in texas and louisiana 
outlook we successfully completed several acquisitions during we expect to continue to spend considerable effort in on acquisitions  as we seek to further our growth 
we expect to drill between and wells and net  respectively in and we estimate capital spending for the year to be approximately million 
our ability to materially increase the number of wells to be drilled beyond our original budget number is heavily dependent upon the timely access to oilfield services  particularly drilling rigs 
the shortage of available rigs in delayed the drilling of several wells  slowing our growth in production 
our expected production volumes  including the addition of the chapman ranch field properties  combined with the current commodity pricing environment  is anticipated to produce another year of record cash flow 
during  we initiated activities via the purchase of undeveloped leasehold in the fayetteville shale in arkansas and floyd shale in mississippi and alabama 
both of these projects are new focus areas 
in order to manage our realized growth in and our anticipated growth for the next several years  we increased our headcount from employees as of december  to employees as of december  resulting in increased g a costs for we expect to add to our staff levels again in both as a result of recent growth and anticipated future growth 
to help protect against the possibility of downward commodity price movements  we have entered into several hedges covering approximately of our expected natural gas production and of our expected crude oil production streams for our outlook and the expected results described above are both subject to change based upon factors that include  but are not limited to  drilling results  commodity prices  access to capital  the acquisitions market and factors referred to in forward looking information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  contingent assets and liabilities and the related disclosures in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
all other significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion presents information about the nature of our most critical accounting estimates  our assumptions or approach used and the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
nature of critical estimate item oil and natural gas reserves our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the economics of producing the reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves also may change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
assumptions approach used units of production method to amortize our oil and natural gas properties the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depletion expense 
any reduction in proved reserves without a corresponding reduction in capitalized costs will increase the depletion rate 
ceiling test the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties requires a quarterly calculation of a limitation on capitalized costs  often referred to as a full cost ceiling calculation 
the ceiling is the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves adjusted for taxes and the impact of hedges on pricing  using a discount rate 
to the extent that our capitalized costs net of accumulated depletion and deferred taxes exceed the ceiling  the excess must be written off to expense 
once incurred  this impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase 
no such impairment was required in the years ended december    and this calculation of our proved reserves could significantly impact our ceiling limitation used in determining whether an impairment of our capitalized costs is necessary 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on our assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on prices and costs in effect as of the end of the period 
oil and natural gas prices used in the reserve valuation at december  were per barrel and per mmbtu 
commodity prices have decreased significantly since december  effect if different assumptions used units of production method to amortize our oil and natural gas properties a increase or decrease in reserves would have decreased or increased  respectively  our depletion expense for the year by approximately 
ceiling limitation test the most likely factor to contribute to a ceiling test impairment is the price used to calculate the reserve limitation threshold 
a significant reduction in the prices at a future measurement date could trigger a full cost ceiling impairment 
at december   we had a cushion ie  the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs of million 
a increase or decrease in prices used would have increased or decreased our cushion by approximately 
our hedging program would serve to mitigate some of the impact of any price decline 
our hedges did not impact the ceiling test in the first  second or fourth quarter of  but did reduce the ceiling in the third quarter by approximately million 
our hedges would not have impacted the ceiling if the natural gas price was lower as these prices were within the collars  but had we increased the natural gas price by the natural gas price would have been less than our hedge floor and therefore resulted in a decrease in the ceiling of million 
another likely factor to contribute to a ceiling test impairment is a revised estimate of reserve volume 
a increase or decrease in reserve volume would have increased or decreased our cushion by approximately 
nature of critical estimate item unproved property impairment we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas activities 
investments in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the prospects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
unproved properties are evaluated quarterly for impairment on a property by property basis 
if the results of an assessment indicate that an unproved property is impaired  the amount of impairment is added to the proved oil and natural gas property costs to be amortized 
assumptions approach used at december   we had million allocated to unproved property 
this allocation is based on our estimation of whether the property has potential attributable reserves 
therefore  our assessment of the potential reserves will determine whether costs are moved from the unproved category to the full cost pool for depletion or whether an impairment is taken 
effect if different assumptions used a increase or decrease in the unproved property balance ie  transfer to full cost pool would have increased or decreased our depletion expense by approximately for the year ended december  nature of critical estimate item asset retirement obligations we have certain obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
prior to january   the costs associated with this activity were capitalized to the full cost pool and charged to income through depletion 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january   as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  sfas no 
requires us to estimate asset retirement costs for all of our assets  adjust those costs for inflation to the forecast abandonment date  discount that amount using a credit adjusted risk free rate back to the date we acquired the asset or obligation to retire the asset and record an aro liability in that amount with a corresponding addition to our asset value 
when new obligations are incurred  ie new well drilled or acquired  we add a layer to the aro liability 
we then accrete the liability layers quarterly using the applicable period end effective credit adjusted risk free rates for each layer 
should either the estimated life or the estimated abandonment costs of a property change upon our quarterly review  a new calculation is performed using the same methodology of taking the abandonment cost and inflating it forward to its abandonment date and then discounting it back to the present using our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the carrying value of the asset retirement obligation is adjusted to the newly calculated value  with a corresponding offsetting adjustment to the asset retirement cost included in the full cost pool  therefore  abandonment costs will almost always approximate the estimate 
when well obligations are relieved by sale of the property or plugging and abandoning the well  the related liability and asset costs are removed from our balance sheet 
assumptions approach used estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the estimate of the present value calculation of our aros are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted risk free rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
effect if different assumptions used since there are so many variables in estimating aros  we attempt to limit the impact of management s judgment on certain of these variables by using input of qualified third parties 
we engage independent engineering firms to evaluate our properties annually 
we use the remaining estimated useful life from the year end reserve reports by our independent reserve engineers in estimating when abandonment could be expected for each property 
we utilize a three year average rate for inflation to diminish any significant volatility that may be present in the short term 
we expect to see our calculations impacted significantly if interest rates move from their current lows  as the credit adjusted risk free rate is one of the variables used on a quarterly basis 
we have developed a standard cost estimate based on historical costs  industry quotes and depth of wells 
unless we expect a well s plugging to be significantly different than a normal abandonment  we use this estimate 
the resulting estimate  after application of a discount factor and some significant calculations  could differ from actual results  despite all our efforts to make an accurate estimate 
nature of critical estimate item income taxes in accordance with the accounting for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have recorded a deferred tax asset and liability to account for the expected future tax benefits and consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
there are several items that result in deferred tax asset and liability impact to the balance sheet  but the largest of which is income taxes and the impact of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
we routinely assess our ability to use all of our nol carryforwards that resulted from substantial income tax deductions  prior year losses and acquisitions 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  it is reduced by a valuation allowance 
assumptions approach used numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
we are not currently required to pay any federal income taxes because of the prior generation of nol s carryforwards 
effect if different assumptions used we have engaged an independent public accounting firm to assist us in applying the numerous and complicated tax law requirements 
however  despite our attempt to make an accurate estimate  the ultimate utilization of our nol carryforwards is highly dependent upon our actual production and the realization of taxable income in future periods 
if we estimate that some or all of our nol carryforwards are more likely than not going to expire or otherwise not be utilized to reduce future tax  we would record a valuation allowance to remove the benefit of those nol carryforwards from our financial statements 
nature of critical estimate item derivative and hedging activities due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from commodity price fluctuations 
while all of these transactions are economic hedges of price risk  different accounting treatment may apply depending on if they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended  all transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
see items and business and properties marketing 
hedge contracts we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used for hedging are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions 
in the event it is determined that the use of a particular derivative may not be or has ceased to be effective in pursuing a hedging strategy  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
the ongoing measurement of effectiveness determines whether the change in fair value is deferred through other comprehensive income oci on the balance sheet or recorded immediately in revenue on the income statement 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of hedge contracts is recorded initially in oci 
when the hedged production is sold  the realized gains and losses on the hedge contracts are removed from oci and recorded in revenue 
ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts are recognized in revenue as they occur 
while the hedge contract is outstanding  the ineffective gain or loss may increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
derivative contracts for transactions not accounted for using cash flow hedge accounting  the change in the fair value of the derivative contract is reflected in revenue immediately  and not deferred through oci  and there is no measurement of effectiveness 
assumptions approach used estimating the fair values of derivative instruments requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique  estimates of risk and volatility  and subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculations use future market commodity prices  which although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecasted price trends 
the results of the fair value calculations cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently obtain the fair value of our positions from our counterparties 
our practice of relying on our counterparties who are more specialized and knowledgeable in preparing these complex calculations reduces our management s input 
effect if different assumptions used at december   a change in the commodity price per unit  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price  would cause the fair value total of our derivative financial instrument to increase or decrease by approximately million 
results of operations this section includes discussion of our  and results of operations 
we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
our resources and assets are managed and our results reported as one operating segment 
we conduct our operations primarily along the onshore united states  gulf coast  with our primary emphasis in south texas  mississippi  louisiana and southeastern new mexico 
revenue and production our primary source of production and revenue is natural gas 
for the years ended december   and  our product mix contributed the following percentages of production and revenues revenues natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil total includes effect of hedging and derivative transactions 
production volumes mcfe natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil total our revenue is sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have a dramatic effect on the prices we receive for our production 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while  the economy  weather and other factors outside of our control could impact demand 
during the third quarter of  two large hurricanes impacted the gulf coast area  causing significant damage to platforms in the gulf and numerous onshore facilities related to our industry 
as a result  both oil and natural gas prices increased 
we were fortunate to only experience minor production deferrals as a result of these hurricanes 
we completed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  which did not have significant impact on revenues and production due to timing  but we expect them to be a source of growth in the following table summarizes production volumes  average sales prices and operating revenue for our oil and natural gas operations for the years ended december   and increase decrease december  vs

includes the effect of hedging and derivative transactions 
natural gas revenue  excluding hedging activity  increased for the year ended december  over the same period in and for the year ended december  over the same period in this growth trend is due to significantly higher production and higher realized prices 
average natural gas production increased from mmcf d in to mmcf d in and to mmcf d in production increases in and as compared to have been the result of significant drilling at our gato creek and encinitas properties in and queen city and southeast new mexico in in addition  a significant amount of growth has come from acquisitions  including the miller and the south texas properties in late  the contango properties on queen city in late and chapman ranch field in late  for which the impact will be more noticeable in partially offsetting the increases in production were natural declines at our o connor ranch and o connor ranch east properties in as compared to  and natural declines at o connor ranch east and brandon and increasing salt water production at duson horst in as compared to excluding the effect of hedges  the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for this increase in average price received resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on year production

excluding the effect of hedges  the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for this increase in average price received resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on year production 
revenue from the sale of ngls increased for the year ended december  over the same period in and for the year ended december  over the same period in daily production volumes for ngls increased from bbls d for the year ended december  to bbls d for and to bbls d in  due primarily to increased production from new wells drilled at gato creek  encinitas  santellana  and southeast new mexico  those acquired at year end from miller and in south texas  and new processing and treating agreements entered into during partially offsetting production increases were declines at our brandon  duson horst and states properties 
our production at gato creek receives a lower average price on ngl s approximately per barrel due to the terms of our marketing agreement for that area 
in  the majority of our ngl production came from gato creek  whereas in and we have added more market priced production that has increased our overall price realized 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel as compared to per barrel in and per barrel for the same period in the increase in ngl production in increased revenue by approximately million based on comparable period average prices 
higher average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on production 
the increase in ngl production in increased revenue by approximately million based on comparable period average prices 
higher average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on production 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate  excluding derivative activity  increased for the year ended december  over the same period in and for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to increased realized prices and production 
the average realized price for oil and condensate before the derivative losses for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel in the same period of these higher average prices for resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on production 
the average realized price for oil and condensate before the derivative losses for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel in the same period of these higher average prices for resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on production 
production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  from bbls d for the same period in and bbls d for the same period in the increase in as compared to was due primarily to successful drilling in southeast new mexico and at our queen city and encinitas projects  as well as the acquisition of existing production in the queen city trend on december   partially offset by declines at the duson horst and brandon projects 
the increase in oil and condensate production as compared to resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period average prices 
the increase in as compared to was due primarily to production from the properties acquired from miller and in south texas  as well as new wells drilled during at our encinitas  gato creek and southeast new mexico properties 
the increase in oil and condensate production as compared to resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period average prices 
losses on hedging and derivatives have declined significantly since this has been a function of the types of contracts and the strategy applied in our price risk management activities 
the volume and price contract terms vary from period to period and therefore interact differently with the market prices 
while we are unable to predict the market prices  we enter into contracts that we expect will protect us in the event of significant downturns in the market 
in  the losses were attributable to natural gas contracts as compared to and when we began hedging our oil production 
the following table summarizes the various components of the total loss on hedging and derivatives for each of the three years ended december   and and the impact each component had on our realized prices year ended december  per unit per unit per unit natural gas hedging contract settlements mcf crude oil derivative contract settlements bbl hedge premium reclassification mcf mark to market reversal of prior period unrealized change in fair value bbl mark to market unrealized change in fair value of oil derivative contract bbl loss on hedging and derivatives mcfe should crude oil or natural gas prices increase or decrease from the current levels  it could materially impact our revenues 
in a high price environment  hedged positions could result in lost opportunities if there is a ceiling in place  thus lowering our effective realized prices on hedged production  but in an environment of falling prices these transactions offer some pricing protection for hedged production 
our physical sales of these commodities are vulnerable to the volatility of the market price movements  therefore we typically enter into contracts covering a portion of anticipated production to ensure certain cash flows that allow us to plan our business activities 
costs and operating expenses the table below presents a detail of the years ended december   and expenses increase decrease december  vs 
vs 
oil and natural gas operating expenses severance and ad valorem taxes depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion oil and gas property and equipment other assets aro accretion general and administrative deferred compensation repriced options deferred compensation restricted stock bad debt expense other general and administrative total operating expenses other expense  net total expense not meaningful oil and natural gas operating expenses increased between and and between and  a increase of over the increase from to has been driven almost equally by activity increases and cost increases 
activity levels were impacted by bringing online apparently successful wells during and apparently successful wells in the and results were impacted by the addition of the miller and south texas properties acquisitions late in that accounted for of the total costs in and in the results had the added costs from the newly acquired contango properties late  which account for of total costs in  representing of the increase from to and of the increase from to the acquisitions of the chapman ranch field properties late in should also add to costs in operating expenses averaged per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increasing cost structure resulted from added costs for compression  workovers and salt water disposal as well as inflation in our industry during we are witnessing increasing costs due to increased demand for oil field products and services 
the oil and natural gas industry tends to be cyclical in nature and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry can put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do many or all associated costs 
when commodity prices decline  associated costs do not necessarily decline at the same rate 
severance and ad valorem taxes increased in both periods 
severance tax expense for was higher than and was higher than severance taxes are levied directly on our revenue dollars  so the increase is consistent with the increases in revenue 
the severance tax rate realized increased from in to in and then decreased to in the rate realized changes as a result of the changing mix of our production locations 
we had a significant portion of production in other states such as louisiana in as compared to the increase in production in texas in  which imposes a tax rate of approximately of the revenue dollar 
in  we had an increasing amount of production in new mexico which added another location to the mix 
ad valorem costs increased in as compared to but decreased in comparing to increased commodity prices in resulted in a higher valuation of reserves by taxing authorities resulting in higher ad valorem taxes on certain properties 
the property additions in were not as significant as those we acquired on december   which represented a significant portion of the total cost in we also realized approximately million of expense in due to very late timing of unexpected costs  which represents of the total cost 
on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes averaged per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a and accretion expense for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  and for the year ended december  over the year ended december  full cost depletion on our oil and natural gas properties totaled million in  million in and million in these increases were driven by production volume increases in and depletion rate increases in for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  higher than the rate of per mcfe 
the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year without a corresponding increase in reserves 
for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe  higher than the rate of per mcfe 
the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year without a corresponding increase in reserves 
depreciation of other assets decreased from to and from to due to accelerating depreciation on leasehold improvements and computer equipment in and when we moved to a new office building early in  we fully depreciated certain assets that would no longer be in service in the new location 
many older assets became fully depreciated at that time and were not replaced in and accretion expense on our aro liability has increased in and in for the addition of new obligations associated with wells added each year  as well as the fact that accretion is calculated using the interest method of allocation  which calculates interest on the cumulative balance such that the interest increases with each subsequent period 
total general and administrative g a expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to the total of million and compared to the total of million 
total g a costs include deferred compensation related to repriced options  deferred compensation related to restricted stock grants and other g a costs 
deferred compensation expense consists of costs reported in accordance with fin and amortization related to restricted stock awards 
fin requires variable accounting for stock options with terms modified after issuance see note to our consolidated financial statements 
variable accounting provides for a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of our common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain re priced options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
we adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period 
we are required to report under this rule as a result of non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain newly issued options in conjunction with the re pricing 
a fin charge on our re priced stock options was required in  and as a result of our stock price exceeding the exercise price of those re priced options 
the average price at december   and that was used to calculate this expense was per share  per share and per share  respectively 
the increase in deferred compensation for restricted stock awards is related to the increase in employee headcount during and other g a expenses  which does not include the deferred compensation expenses discussed above  increased over which was higher than the increase in other g a from to was in part attributable to the growth in our company from full time and two part time employees at december  to full time employees at december  in and  we added new corporate office space to house the growth in our company  which increased our rent expense 
we also have been impacted by higher audit and legal fees and amounts spent on investor relations projects during and we incurred approximately  of costs for the implementation of the sarbanes oxley internal control report during  but none in in  we realized additional costs related to the internal control report of approximately  that were unexpected 
in  the total estimated costs related to the internal control report are approximately  this does not include any amounts of the significant internal resources that were directed towards this project  especially the internal audit department we added during these increases were partially offset by decreases in general office related spending in included in were charitable contributions of  to the hurricane katrina relief effort and bad debt expense of  for joint interest owner accounts receivable that we believe are uncollectible 
included in was a  settlement for a lawsuit related to seismic rights 
for the years ended december   and  overhead reimbursement fees reduced g a costs by approximately   and  respectively 
we capitalized million  million and million of general and administrative costs in  and  respectively 
overall other g a is increasing as the company grows  but we are maintaining discipline in controlling our costs and realizing greater benefits from the growth  such as increased production volumes and revenues 
other g a expenses on a unit of production basis for the years ended december   and were per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
we believe that the downward trend in this per unit cost structure is indicative of our attention to controlling costs 
other income expense excludes interest expense for the year ended december  because of our interest expense was capitalized as compared to the years ended december  and in which only a portion was capitalized 
we incurred higher interest costs for the year ended december  than for the same period of and due to higher commitment fees and higher interest rates  but we capitalized all of our expense as a result of our unproved property balance exceeding our weighted average debt balance 
at december   and our unproved property balance was million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december  gross interest less capitalized interest interest expense  net weighted average debt also included in other income expense for the year ended december  and was  and  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with our credit facility 
there were no such costs in also included in other income expense was interest income  which totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the interest is earned on daily cash invested in overnight money market funds 
we have had increased cash on hand in recent years providing for the increased interest income 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes and although we are currently generating taxable income for financial reporting purposes  we are not in a federal income tax paying position as a result of deducting intangible drilling costs idc that reduce our taxable income for income tax purposes and nol carryforwards that offset any remaining taxable income 
deferred income tax provisions of million  million and million were recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of the increase year over year has been the growth in income before income taxes 
due to changes in amounts of permanent tax differences  including meals and entertainment and compensation expense  our effective tax rate also changes from time to time 
the effective rate was for the year ended december   as compared to in and in as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated or acquired that will begin to expire in we were required to make an alternative minimum tax payment for of  upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal of  net of income taxes of  and accretion expense  to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depletion and accretion 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or per basic and per diluted earnings per share  as compared to million  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in the same period of and net income after cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million  or basic and diluted earnings per share in basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million at december  to million at december  and to million at december  the impact of the shares issued in the miller transaction was not fully realized until since the merger closed and the shares were issued in december the same was true in for the shares issued in the public offering in december there were also minimal increases due to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during and liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing source of capital is the cash flow generated from our operating activities supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production volumes and commodity prices  both of which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  as well as operating efficiency and capital spending 
our business  as with other extractive businesses  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent unit produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our overall expected future production decline is estimated to be approximately per year 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and  therefore capital budgets 
we attempt to mitigate the price risk with our hedging program 
reserves and production volumes are influenced  in part  by the amount of future capital expenditures 
in turn  capital expenditures are influenced by many factors including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  prices  availability of goods and services and the extent to which oil and gas properties are acquired 
our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  and the repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
we attempt to fund our exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected cash flows 
we routinely adjust capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  and cash flow 
we have historically used our credit facility to supplement any deficiencies between operating cash flow and capital expenditures 
we typically have funded acquisitions from borrowings under our credit facility  cash flow from operations and sales of common stock 
significant changes to working capital may affect our liquidity in the short term 
the increase in accrued fees for professional services and royalties payable at december  accounts for most of the increase in accrued liabilities 
therefore  we expect our short term cash outflows for the first quarter of to increase as these liabilities come due 
there are also advance payments made to one of our operators included in our current assets 
as the actual costs are realized  this balance will diminish 
the increase in the derivative instrument liability is indicative of potential future cash settlements on our hedge positions  which are scheduled to settle in the coming months 
the fair market value of our outstanding hedge and derivative contracts is reflected on the balance sheet as a liability for the positions with each of our two counterparties 
this hedge and derivative financial instrument is a liability because the future strip commodity prices exceed the price caps on our contracts at the balance sheet date  such that if the contracts were to settle at the balance sheet date we would have significant losses 
the fair market value represents the potential settlement for those contracts if the market prices remain unchanged  but should commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair value of those outstanding contracts would change and the settlements at maturity would also change 
when our hedges and derivatives require us to pay a cash settlement  we are receiving higher cash inflows on the sale of unhedged production at higher prices  providing us with funds which would adequately cover any derivative and hedge payments when they come due 
we have historically used our credit facility to supplement any deficiencies between operating cash flow and capital expenditures 
we had million outstanding under the credit facility at december  the maturity for this credit facility is december  after considering the impact of these working capital changes and our forecasts of future results of operations  we believe that cash flows from operating activities  as supplemented by borrowings on our credit facility  combined with our ability to control the timing of certain of our future exploration and development requirements  will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our planned capital requirements for in addition  our credit facility had million available at december  for general corporate purposes  exploratory and developmental drilling and acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
during and early  we realized increased cash flows as a result of our public stock offerings and exercises of options and warrants to acquire shares of our common stock 
most significant were the net proceeds of million that we received  before direct costs of million  from our december offering of our common stock and the related exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option for  additional shares of our common stock  resulting in an additional million of net proceeds to us in january at december   we had certain options outstanding and exercisable for shares of our common stock 
we typically do not rely on proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options to sustain our business as the timing of their exercise is unpredictable 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to and was primarily due to higher oil and gas production revenue partially offset by higher operating expense 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  production and capital spending 
in an effort to reduce the volatility realized on commodity prices  we enter into derivative instruments 
due to inflated crude oil market pricing  the impact related to the derivatives for has been negative  as the prices have exceeded the highs we originally expected 
we have realized the benefit of these high prices on our crude oil production  but also realized the negative impact from cash settlements of million on our crude oil derivatives 
we have also paid million of net cash settlements on our natural gas hedges due to the natural gas market prices rising above our hedge ceilings 
overall  oil and gas production revenue for increased over and over although fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for our short term changes in cash flow from operating activities  increased production volumes significantly impacted us in our business  as with other extractive businesses  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our ability to prevent shrinkage will be affected in the future by the successes and or failures of our exploration  production and acquisition activities 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and  therefore capital budgets 
for these reasons  we only forecast  for internal use by management  an annual cash flow 
we do analyze contingent well opportunities that may extend further than one year  but do not rely on them for sustaining our business 
these annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions 
longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see items a 
risk factors our operations have significant capital requirements which  if not met will hinder operations 
net cash used in investing activities we reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million in investing activities during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were apparently successful 
acquisition costs related to the private company corporate acquisition totaled million  net of cash acquired  and other acquisition costs totaled million  mainly related to the chapman ranch field asset acquisition 
other spending includes million in expenditures attributable to land holdings  capitalized g a and interest and million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
in connection with the acquisition we completed in december  we are now required to make drilling advances to the operator of those properties 
therefore a new item in is drilling advances related to our queen city properties of million 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware  office furniture and equipment for the expansion into additional office space 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were partially offset by  of proceeds from the sale of one well and a gas cooler during the year 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   which includes million related to the contango asset acquisition 
other spending includes million in expenditures attributable to land holdings and million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware  office furniture and equipment for the expansion into additional office space 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   were partially offset by million of cash received in the miller merger net of merger costs incurred and million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs  excluding miller  totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
due to our active exploration  development and acquisition activities  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land  legal and seismic activities  and million relates to capitalized interest  g a and other 
we intend to fund these capital expenditures  and other commitments and working capital requirements with expected cash flow from operations and  to the extent necessary  other sources 
should there be a change in our pricing or production assumptions  we believe that we have sufficient financial flexibility from other financing sources to meet our financial obligations as they come due  and we would recommend to our board an adjustment to our capital expenditures program accordingly so as to avoid unnecessary incremental borrowings that may be needed for acquisitions 
we do not explicitly budget for acquisitions  however  we do expect to spend considerable effort evaluating acquisition opportunities 
we expect to fund acquisitions through traditional reserve based bank debt and or the issuance of equity and  if required  through additional debt and equity financings 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  we had million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
we incurred loan costs of approximately  in amending our credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options and warrants exercised in the majority of those proceeds are related to the january underwriter exercise of the over allotment option to the december common stock offering 
the funds generated from that exercise were used to reduce debt early in for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
in addition  we completed a public offering of common stock in december that provided million of net proceeds  after direct costs 
for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in as a result of the increase in our stock price 
the combination of unused debt capacity and our current shelf registration see discussion below should allow us the financial flexibility to continue to participate in acquisitions and complete our capital programs as we move into as of december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
credit facility on november   the company amended its third amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility  which it had originally entered into in march effective december  and previously amended on may  the credit facility permits borrowings up to the lesser of i the borrowing base and ii million 
effective november  the borrowing base under the credit facility was increased from million to million as a result of the chapman ranch field acquisitions and our drilling activities since the last redetermination 
based on the increase  our available borrowing capacity at december  was million 
we expect our borrowing base to be redetermined in april and semiannually thereafter 
the credit facility matures december  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to prime plus or libor plus 
as of december   our interest rate was 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and as of march  million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  and engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the credit facility also prohibits dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens 
the credit facility also contains the following financial covenants  among others the ebitdax to interest expense ratio requires that the ratio of a our consolidated ebitdax defined as ebitda plus similar non cash items and exploration and abandonment expenses for such period for the four fiscal quarters then ended to b our consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters then ended  to not be less than to the working capital ratio requires that the amount of our consolidated current assets less our consolidated current liabilities  as defined in the credit facility agreement  be at least million 
for the purposes of calculating the working capital ratio  the total of current assets is adjusted for unused capacity under the credit facility agreement  and derivative financial instruments and the total of current liabilities is adjusted for the current portion of indebtedness under the credit facility agreement  derivative financial instruments and asset retirement obligations 
the maximum leverage ratio requires that the ratio  as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  of a total indebtedness as defined in the credit facility agreement as of such fiscal quarter to b an amount equal to consolidated ebitdax for the two quarters then ended times two  not be greater than to consolidated ebitdax is a component of negotiated covenants with our lenders and is presented here as part of the company s disclosure of its covenant obligations 
shelf registration statement during the second quarter  we filed a registration statement with the sec which registered offerings of up to million of any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants for debt securities or equity securities of the company 
net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offering of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings 
the shelf registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
our ability to utilize our shelf registration statement for the purpose of issuing  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants for debt securities or equity securities will depend upon  among other things  market conditions and the existence of investors who wish to purchase our securities at prices acceptable to us 
in connection with the filing of the registration statement  we deregistered the remaining shares then available for sale under our earlier million shelf registration statement filed in on december   we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock  which generated net proceeds to us  before direct costs of the offering  of million 
these funds were used to finance the south texas asset acquisition that closed on december  with a final adjusted purchase price of million  before other acquisition costs  and fund the costs of the offering and other general corporate purposes 
on january   the underwriters exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of million 
these funds were used to reduce our outstanding debt 
each of these sales was made under our shelf registration statement 
at december   we had million remaining for issuance under our shelf registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  by payment due date total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations excludes amounts for interest expense payable upon outstanding debt 
long term outstanding debt under our credit facility is subject to floating interest rates see note to our consolidated financial statements and payable on the last day of each calendar month while any loan amounts remain outstanding 
we did not have any capital leases or purchase obligations as of december  we have not included our aro liability here because historically the actual cash outlay is minimized significantly by the salvage value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not account for salvage value on our balance sheet  but we do not expect to realize the total value that we have accrued 
risk management activities derivatives and hedging due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements may limit our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also reduces our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
our arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  apply to only a portion of our production  provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limit our potential gains from future increases in prices 
we also use price risk management transactions to protect forward pricing as a bidding strategy with respect to acquisition offers and execution 
none of these instruments are used for trading purposes 
on a quarterly basis  our management sets all of our price risk management policies  including volumes  types of instruments and counterparties 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
our board of directors monitors the company s price risk management policies and trades 
all of these price risk management transactions are considered derivative instruments and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these derivative instruments are intended to hedge our price risk and may be considered hedges for economic purposes  but certain of these transactions may not qualify for special cash flow hedge accounting 
therefore  depending on the type of transaction and the circumstances  different accounting treatment may apply to the timing and location of the income statement impact  but all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
the following table provides additional information regarding our various derivative and hedging transactions that were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as of december  fair value of contracts outstanding at december  contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period fair value of new contracts when entered into during asset liability changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions other changes in fair values fair values of contracts outstanding at december  the following table details the fair value of our commodity based derivative and hedging contracts by year of maturity and valuation methodology as of december  fair value of contracts at december  source of fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources asset liability prices based on models and other valuation methods total tax matters at december   we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  including million of nols acquired in the miller merger that expire beginning through these estimated nols assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs  have been written off for tax purposes in the current year 
however  we have not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires companies to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on a grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  and that cost must generally be recognized over the vesting period 
sfas no 
r amends the original sfas no 
and that had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
we currently account for our stock based compensation plans under the principles prescribed by apb opinion no 
accordingly  no stock option compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will impact our results of operations  but will have no impact on our overall financial position 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
among other things  sab no 
provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sfas no 
r was to become effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   but on april   the sec issued press release  which amends the compliance date of sfas no 
r until fiscal years beginning after june  we anticipate adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method for transition 
under this method we will recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards granted or modified on or after july   as well as any previously granted awards that are not fully vested as of july  compensation expense will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we expect the impact to be immaterial due to the fact that we have not issued options since april and there will only be a minimal number of unvested options as of our adoption date 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reflected as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  provided an exception to its basic measurement principle fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets 
under apb opinion no 
 an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset was based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that the term  conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional upon a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
even though uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement exists and may be conditional upon a future event  the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development or through the normal operation of the asset 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  retrospective application for interim financial information is permitted but is not required 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
application is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which improves financial reporting by eliminating the exemption from applying sfas no 
to interests in securitized financial assets so that similar instruments are accounted for similarly regardless of the form of the instruments and allows a preparer to elect fair value measurement at acquisition  at issuance  or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement new basis event  on an instrument by instrument basis  in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated 
providing a fair value measurement election also results in more financial instruments being measured at what the fasb regards as the most relevant attribute for financial instruments  fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we use a credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of our operations 
we are not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in our floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provides a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit us to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  outstanding borrowings and our applicable interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business we enter into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
during  we put in place several natural gas and crude oil collars for a portion of our production to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
the following is a list of hedge and derivative contracts outstanding at december  transaction date transaction type beginning ending price per unit volumes per day fair value outstanding as of december  natural gas collar  mmbtu collar  mmbtu crude oil collar bbl our current hedging activities for natural gas were entered into on a per mmbtu delivered price basis  using the houston ship channel index  with settlement for each calendar month occurring five business days following the expiration date 
hedge accounting is not applied to our collars on crude oil  which were entered into on a per barrel delivered price basis  using the west texas intermediate index  with settlement for each calendar month occurring five business days following the expiration date 
the change in fair value is reflected in revenue 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding hedge and derivative contracts was a net liability of approximately million see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management activities derivatives and hedging 
a change in the commodity price per unit  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price of each contract  would cause the fair value total of the outstanding net asset position to increase or decrease by approximately million
