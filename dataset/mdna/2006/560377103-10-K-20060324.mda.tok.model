therefore  no assurance can be given that the outcomes stated in such forward looking statements and estimates will be achieved 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our projections include  among other matters  electric utility restructuring  future economic and demographic conditions within mps s service area and unregulated markets  changes in tax rates  interest rates or rates of inflation  ability to raise capital  pace and success of merger and acquisition efforts  terrorism  changes in the construction industry  changes in canadian currency rates  length of sales cycles  developments in state  provincial and national legislative and regulatory environments in the united states and canada  ability to recruit individuals with necessary skill sets  increased competition by existing or new competitors in the company s unregulated markets  changes in technology  new innovations  changes in nafta  increased environmental regulations and other regulatory or market based conditions 
annual performance summary financial results were diminished for the year compared to and due to a myriad of cost factors 
during the year mps s performance was lower than historically expected with cost of service rising such that its return on its distribution rate base was inadequate 
tmg did not achieve its targets as a result of a lack of adequate capitalization  costs associated with transitioning acquisitions from small privately held firms to publicly traded company standards  lagging business development  and the slowed pace of accretive acquisitions 
mti s performance was impacted by its lack of business development and need to upgrade its software solutions 
maricor properties was in a start up phase during as real estate assets were leased up and or acquired 
while mam s overall financial performance in was less than anticipated  it made meaningful progress in advancing its growth strategy that remains in its infancy 
management is taking steps to improve future performance and believes it must increase its speed and focus on growing its unregulated operations 
collectively  mam s unregulated diversification and growth strategy remains in its infancy stages 
it continues to experience cash flow challenges 
management is taking steps to bridge necessary cash flows until when mam s cash flow situation should improve 
improved economic performance of existing unregulated subsidiary operations is important and steps are being taken to improve such performance 
however  management believes that adequate capitalization  increased pace of acquisitions  and enhanced business development are critical keys to mam s unregulated organizations collective financial performance  both in the near and long terms 
management does recognize a number of short term financial and operating challenges  however  we believe our long term outlook is encouraging 
to improve long term shareholder value and earnings  management believes that the company must increase its pace of organic and inorganic unregulated growth  while forming capital in an equally timely manner supportive of such growth 
as previously noted  management does not believe a status quo or stay as you are strategic option exists to create long term shareholder value for mam 
further  given the impact of electric deregulation  generation divestiture  and disaggregation of the electric utility industry within maine  combined with the lagging economy of mps s service area  management does not believe reverting solely to its core regulated wires business can generate adequate long term shareholder value 
however  management also believes that its regulated operation s performance must be continually enhanced 
as a result of increasing costs of service  mps filed in march a request for a distribution rate increase 
the outcome of this docket will not be known  in all probability  until the third quarter of although a request for an increase in distribution rates has been made  mps cannot predict the outcome or the rate of increase that may be allowed 
further  given recent interest in mps s service area by several wind generators  there are over mw s of proposed wind generation planned for the utility s service area 
should these projects move forward  they hold potential for contract work associated with the construction of additional transmission and substation facilities  as well as the potential rebuilding of part or all of mps s transmission system funded by the developers 
while mps cannot predict with certainty that these projects will be constructed  management does believe they are potentially positive projects for its service area 
through more timely execution of mam s inorganic unregulated growth strategy  including formation of growth capital  as well as improved organic growth  and mps s proposed distribution rate increase  management is focused on increasing earnings across all business lines 
should the company not achieve a level of unregulated growth consistent with the need to create long term shareholder value within a reasonable timeframe  management and the board of directors will need to assess strategic alternatives to its current growth strategy 
resulting actions could involve the sale or partial sale of certain or all unregulated assets or other alternatives  recognizing the need to act prudently in protecting and enhancing long term shareholder value 
further  if the company does not receive an adequate distribution rate increase to cover its utility costs and allowing for a fair return on rate base  management will need to assess its strategic options to preserve and grow shareholder value 
however  management does believe that the timely and efficient implementation of the company s growth strategy  cost control within its utility operations  and implementation of prudent rate increase requests when warranted can result in achieving desired long term shareholder value 
given mam s need to reinvest in its future and expand its scale to improve its overall financial performance  particularly its unregulated operations  management cannot warrant that it will continue to pay dividends at historic levels or on a continuing basis until its cash flows and earning performances improve 
further  management believes that it must address the under capitalization issues facing the company before considering a dividend for its common shareholders 
however  it is the goal of management to expeditiously enhance the performance of the company and to continue as a yield and growth at a reasonable price stock 
management believes its strategy is sound and that meaningful progress is being made in the firm s overall structural and economic transition 
overview of company strategy mam s overall strategy was developed in response to a number of converging macro economic trends that management believes will drive market opportunities both in the near and long term 
the year underscored the reality that turbulence within the energy industry  exacerbated by geo political conflicts and growing third world demand for energy  are predicted to have significant price  supply  and security impacts on businesses and organizations within north america 
while an increasing emphasis is being placed on supply side issues by north american governments  we see expanding governmental mandates and a renewed customer driven need to improve energy efficiency and control energy related costs 
as energy related issues remain at the forefront of public policy issues  and an increasing cost and reliability concern for businesses and organizations  mam believes there will be an increasing demand for energy efficiency related services and solutions  including an expanded market place interest in on site and alternative energy electric generation 
while energy costs and reliability remain a concern  businesses and organizations are facing a significant financial challenge as they realize the economic threats created by escalating deferred maintenance liabilities 
as businesses and organizations underfunded their capital renewal and asset maintenance programs year after year  many are now faced with staggering deferred maintenance liabilities 
in many cases the deferred maintenance on facility and energy related assets threatens the continued viability of such assets 
increasingly  mam believes businesses and organizations are requiring more intensive capital expenditure planning  working to ensure that every capital dollar spent is the most optimal investment they can make 
further  to address burgeoning deferred maintenance liabilities  organizations are looking to advanced business processes that can help extend the functional and economic lifecycle of physical assets 
mam believes that by enhancing the energy efficiency and controlling organizations energy related expenditures that an entity can free up capital to address their deferred maintenance liabilities 
further  by designing and building new energy related and energy efficient facilities related infrastructure  operating costs can be reduced while built environment assets are renewed 
while energy and deferred maintenance liabilities are of growing concern within the marketplace  management believes there is an increasing north american awareness of climate change and the need to address emissions reductions 
we believe that energy efficiency  alternative on site generation  and sustainable asset management techniques are key to reducing emissions from the built environment 
we continue to see growing business interests and government mandates to address climate change  particularly within the northeast united states and canada 
as more and more businesses and governments adopt a sustainable approach to their actions  we believe opportunities will evolve related to the market demand for sustainable asset management and energy related solutions 
as evidenced by the passage of the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory actions  there are increasing interests in and growing mandates to improve the transparency of asset governance reporting 
businesses and organizations are being pressed to provide increasing details concerning the performance of owned assets  both from an economic and environmental perspective 
consequently  we also see an emergence of market interests in improved asset governance reporting  a critical part of mti s sustainability centric solutions that also address organization s energy  emissions reductions  and deferred maintenance needs 
we believe the convergence of these issues will create a substantial marketplace demand  with current solutions and services being minimal 
addressing these issues and advancing businesses and organizations achievement of a stakeholder centric triple bottom line requires the integration of physical  intellectual  and technology based assets that when combined result in dynamic solutions to growing challenges regarding the aging infrastructure  climate change  energy pricing and security  and our ability to support the changing needs of society 
through the amalgamation of diverse  but relevant skills and technologies in the building sciences  engineering  information technology  and energy consulting fields  mam is positioning itself to be a leading professional services  product and asset based solutions company 
mam s unregulated operations are increasingly focused on sustainable solutions  progressively building professional services competencies to provide products  services  and solutions  such as  but not limited to a sustainable university and college campus planning with a strong focus on on campus energy infrastructure  b energy efficiency evaluations and solutions focused on the governments  hospitals  universities  schools  institutional and office commercial markets  c sustainable asset management ranging from facility infrastructure condition assessments to capital planning to facility renewal  d on site energy asset development including co generation  alternative fuel and distributed generation solutions  e energy supply management  f sustainable real estate development and renewal  including public and private partnerships such as the construction and ownership of university dormitories  g sustainable and transparent asset governance and reporting  and h leed engineering design services 
mam s execution strategy involves a combination of organic and inorganic strategies 
however  key to amassing the requisite talent and core competencies is a proposed aggressive acquisitions program 
simply hiring one individual talent at a time will not enable the necessary ramping up of the business to achieve the required scale and desired level of profitability 
recognizing that there are limited acquisition opportunities across north america  mam s efficiency in identifying potential targets  undertaking due diligence  forming capital and closing transactions in a timely manner is critical 
given that few  if any  potential acquisition candidates exist today that provide the array of proposed integrated sustainable services  products  and assets  mam recognizes its need to acquire companies that bring discreet portions of the value proposition and amalgamate integrated services offerings across acquired companies through the organic development of a high level business development and transaction structuring organization 
such a high level  organically grown business development staff will require experienced individuals with a high degree of relative domain knowledge  as well as experience in structuring financial transactions  often referred to as financial engineers 
through these senior staff members  solutions to clients needs are crafted using multiple discreet offerings or capabilities  integrated into a seamless solution 
each individual offering will continue to be sold on a one off basis  such as selling engineering design services 
however  the more complex and higher value integrated offerings will be sold and managed by a higher level business development organization currently being organized and staffed 
while management believes mam s strategy is well aligned with existing and projected macro economic trends  it believes its success will depend on the company s ability to expeditiously a recruit  train and execute a high level business development organization  b to identify  undertake due diligence  acquire and integrate multiple companies providing required core competencies and c to form adequate working and growth capital to support the company s organic and inorganic growth strategies 
management further believes  given its holding company structure  that the company s unregulated operations must achieve increased scale  allowing for necessary critical mass to support corporate related costs and ensure meaningful contribution to earnings per share 
mam s strategy includes the continuing operation of its regulated utility  maine public service company 
however  given the projected decline in its regulatory rate base  management believes earnings may decline somewhat and then become more stable 
mps will continue to be challenged by cost pressures and  while a long term meaningful contributor to earnings per share  management does not believe it can create growing long term shareholder value unless unregulated operations are grown in a more expeditious manner
