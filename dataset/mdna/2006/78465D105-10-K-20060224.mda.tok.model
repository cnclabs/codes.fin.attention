revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of the company s services are provided under time and expenses billing arrangements and revenue is recognized on the basis of hours utilized  and other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
revenue is directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates 
a limited amount of revenue is also derived from success fees offered to clients as a pricing option  and recorded as revenue only upon the attainment of the specified incentive criteria 
success fees are not billable and revenue is not recorded until the customer wins a contract 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates made in preparing the financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for discontinued operations  and income tax valuation allowances 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable 
the company s accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers primarily in the united states 
the majority of the company s receivables are from large companies in the aerospace and defense industries 
the company controls credit risk through credit approvals and monitoring procedures and  generally  does not require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk 
management must make estimates regarding the collection of its accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts
