the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however future results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are policies that reflect material judgment and uncertainty and may result in materially different results using different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers the following as its critical accounting policies and estimates frequent flyer revenue and impairment of long lived assets 
for a detailed discussion of accounting policies  refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
frequent flyer revenue a portion of the revenue from the sale of frequent flyer mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is likely to be provided  based on estimates of the fair value of tickets to be redeemed  straight line over months  which is the company s estimate of when travel will occur 
the estimated incremental cost of providing future transportation in conjunction with travel miles under the company s frequent flyer program is accrued based on an estimated redemption of applied to actual mileage recorded in members accounts to calculate the award level 
to estimate incremental costs  the company includes the additional costs related to transportation of passengers  over and above costs to transport vacant seats  such as fuel  meals  insurance  ticketing as well as the cost of partner programs 
a change to these cost estimates and the estimated redemption percentage could have a signific ant impact on the company s liability in the period the change is made  as well as in future periods 
the ultimate cost will depend on the actual redemption of frequent flyer miles  and may be greater or less than amounts accrued at december  impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
the company uses judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors the company considers that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company is required to make estimates of its future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for the company s service  future market conditions and industry competition 
other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates 
maintenance and repair costs routine maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased aircraft are charged to expense when incurred 
the company expenses airframe maintenance costs as they are incurred 
substantially all midwest airlines and midwest connect engines are under fleet hour agreements and engine maintenance is primarily expensed straight line over the term of the contract 
the fleet hour agreements may have occurrence limits that  if exceeded  will cause additional expense to be incurred 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no arrangements of the types described in any of the categories that may have a material current or future effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

as of december   the company had a working capital surplus of million compared with million on december  the reduction in working capital as of december  is primarily related to an increase in restricted and unrestricted cash offset by increases in air traffic liability  unearned partner revenue and accrued liabilities 
operating activities net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared with million net cash used in cash provided by operations reflects the million net loss incurred during the year  which was offset by a million non cash md impairment charge  million increase of unearned revenue primarily associated with the company s frequent flyer program  million of increased air traffic liability due to increased sales for future flights  million depreciation and million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the cash used in includes million of capital expenditures primarily relating to the purchase of commissary equipment  a spare engine  and spare parts and other equipment for the boeing program 
a million increase in cash was provided by the net effect of decreases in aircraft purchase deposits and pre delivery progress payments related to future deliveries of boeing aircraft that were offset by purchase deposits that had been returned for the five boeing deliveries in an increase in credit card sales for future flights required an increase of million in restricted cash 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities during totaled million  compared with net cash used in financing activities in of million 
the change is primarily due to the million increase in net proceeds related to the return of pre delivery progress payments associated with delivery of boeing s 
in second quarter  midwest airlines entered into a loan agreement to fund pre delivery progress payments to the boeing company for new boeing aircraft 
midwest airlines also entered into a loan agreement with kreditanstalt fur wiederaufbau bank kfw with the assistance of rolls royce deutschland ltd

principal and interest on these basic moratorium notes are payable  in arrears  in monthly installments 
payment began in july for a total of million in principal payments as of december as a result of the restructuring of lease and debt agreements  the company has significantly lowered its obligations compared to the obligations under the previous lease and debt agreements 
included in the restructured agreements are clauses that would make the company s obligations  under certain default situations  increase to the amounts under the previous agreements 
such defaults include the company filing for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the amount of such contingent obligation of the company was approximately million as of december  these contingent liabilities are scheduled to expire in other factors affecting liquidity the company has not paid federal income taxes in the last four years 
as of december   the company had a non current deferred tax liability of million and deferred tax assets aggregating million

due to the uncertainty of realizing the nols  the company recorded a state valuation allowance of million and a federal valuation allowance of million in the year ended december  contractual obligations the following table of material debt and lease commitments at december  summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods set forth below in thousands related cash outflows contractual obligations total and and and after long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligation other long term commitments total note regarding the company s commitments to acquire boeing aircraft  the above table reflects  under other long term commitments  the estimated lease payments the company expects to pay after delivery of aircraft which the company has estimated based on assumptions regarding lease terms  interest rates and other factors  rather than reflecting the purchase price for the aircraft and the related obligation to make progress payments 
similarly  long term debt in the above table does not include debt for progress payments related to the acquisition of boeing aircraft 
the company s aircraft financing is discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
and beyond the competitive revenue environment and volatile nature of fuel prices make it difficult to accurately project cash flow from operations for and beyond 
absent factors outside the control of the company such as terrorist attacks or heightened fear of terrorist attacks  substantial deterioration in the industry revenue environment and significant increases in fuel prices  the company believes current liquidity and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund current operations through key cash flow items for and beyond include anticipated total capital spending of approximately million for and similar spending annually in and  excluding aircraft acquisitions  which are expected to be leased 
the company expects most of the spending to be for spare parts for the boeing program and continued maintenance support of midwest airlines md fleet 
some of the capital spending will be funded using credit memos 
estimated net interest income of million in non cash expenses arising primarily from depreciation contributing approximately million to annual cash flow in estimated defined benefit pension plan contributions of approximately million in payment of principal on the lender and lessor moratorium note for totaling approximately million  ending with principal payments of million in new accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
