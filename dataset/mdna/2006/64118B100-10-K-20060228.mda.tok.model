we may pay an additional million in cash and up to approximately million in shares of common stock upon achieving specific revenue objectives as outlined in the agreement 
the sahasra algorithmic technology complements our layer processing initiative and is a beneficial building block in driving towards low cost layer applications acceleration and security processing solutions 
in addition  the nse  ayama and ayama expand our customer base and product offerings in the high volume  entry level layer switch market 
we expect this acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect our revenue  cost of revenue and operating expenses to increase in the future as a result of this acquisition 
the discussions in this section of the annual report on form k  as well as the financial statements contained herein  does not reflect the impact of the acquisition 
overview we are a semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets high performance knowledge based processors for a variety of advanced internet  corporate and other networking systems  such as routers  switches  network security appliances  network access equipment and networked storage devices 
knowledge based processors are integrated circuits that employ an advanced processor architecture and a large knowledge database containing information on the network  as well as applications and content that run on the network to make complex decisions about individual packets of information traveling through the network 
our knowledge based processors significantly enhance the ability of networking original equipment manufacturers  or oems  to supply network service providers with systems offering more advanced functionality for the internet  such as voice transmission over the internet  or voip  unified threat management  or utm  virtual private networks  or vpns  and streaming video and audio 

table of contents our knowledge based processors incorporate advanced technologies that enable rapid processing  such as a superscalar architecture  which uses parallel processing techniques  and deep pipelining  which segments processing tasks into smaller sub tasks  for higher decision throughput 
these technologies enable networking systems to perform a broad range of network aware and content aware processing functions  such as application based routing  utm network security  intrusion detection and prevention  virus inspection  access control for network security  prioritization of traffic flow to maintain quality of service  or qos  and statistical measurement of internet traffic for transaction billing 
in january  we announced the launch of our netl family of layer knowledge based processors 
the first product in the netl family is the nls content processor that accelerates pattern and signature recognition tasks for enterprise and carrier class networks  and is used to perform gigabits per second wire speed content inspection of packets traveling through the network 
the nls content processor extends the processing capabilities of our knowledge based processors into the packet payload  thereby enabling the design and deployment of next generation networking systems that can make packet processing decisions based on an awareness of the packet content 
typical applications for the nls content processor include layer application switches and routers  unified threat management appliances  intrusion detection and prevention systems and anti virus gateways 
the netl family of layer knowledge based processors are expected to expand our customer base in the communications  networking  security appliance  software provider and computing markets 
since the second half of  we have experienced significant revenue growth caused by a rapid rise in new customer orders for our knowledge based processors 
our total revenue increased from million in to million during the year ended december  and by from to million for the year ended december  while our total revenue for the year ended december  and included non recurring license fees of approximately million and million  respectively  related to our license agreement with micron technology  inc  we had no such revenue during the year ended december  we do not expect similar revenue growth rates in future periods  nor do we expect to receive any significant revenues from non recurring engineering services 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive than other businesses because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our products 
in general  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures 
in transitioning from a design and development company to volume production as a fabless semiconductor company  we required significant funds for our ramp up in production to support increased sales of our knowledge based processors 
in the future  as we launch new products or expand our operations  we may require additional funds to procure product mask sets  order elevated quantities of wafers from our foundry partners  perform qualification testing and assemble and test those products 
we employ a direct sales force as well as a sales representative network to sell our products 
the majority of our revenue comes from customers headquartered in the united states 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
our product sales cycles can take up to months to complete and volume production can take an additional six months to be achieved  if at all 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications might result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory or operating expenses 
our recent rapid revenue growth makes it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to our customers or our international stocking sales representatives 
our revenue consists primarily of sales of our knowledge based processors to networking oems and contract manufacturers 
initial sales of our products for a new design are usually made directly to networking oems 
once a design enters production  a networking oem often outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers that purchase products directly from us 

table of contents since we purchase all wafers from suppliers with fabrication facilities and outsource the assembly and testing to third party vendors  a significant portion of our costs of revenue consists of payments to our third party vendors 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers and rely upon them to fulfill our orders 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel as well as costs related to new and existing product development  depreciation  software maintenance and facilities costs 
all research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred 
in order for us to remain competitive  we believe a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development efforts 
we also believe research and development headcount will increase in the future  and that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of revenue 
selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  marketing programs  travel  facilities overhead and bonuses and commissions for independent sales representatives 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance and accounting  patent and corporate legal expenses  and facilities overhead 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make fair and reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and operating expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
one of the criteria for revenue recognition is that the collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
determination of this criterion is based on management s judgments regarding the collectability of those fees 
the recent growth and the establishment of new or more significant customer relationships mean that management does not have a substantial history of making these judgments 
to date  our customers consist primarily of large  well established publicly traded companies 
should our customer base change to include smaller  less established companies  and collectability of accounts receivable from these customers be uncertain  revenue recognition for a reporting period may be negatively affected 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitments 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these estimates are generally based on a month forecast prepared by management 
if our inventory on hand is in excess of our forecast  the excess amounts are written off 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the carrying value of inventory and the determination of possible adverse purchase commitments are dependent on our estimate of the yield that will be achieved  or the percent of good products identified when the product is tested 
a small change in yield could result in a significant adjustment and have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded charges to cost of revenue of million as a result of a low expected yield on work in process inventories on hand and on order with our vendors that resulted in the estimated cost of finished product exceeding its estimated market value 
the estimated cost was based on actual yield experience and estimated costs to test and package our products 
these estimates were based on historical costs of similar products 
the charge reduced the carrying value of our inventory to record them at their estimated market value and established reserves to cover expected future losses and adverse purchase 
table of contents commitments 
since then our production yields have improved  but we may experience lower than expected yields in the future  primarily upon the introduction of new products 
warranty accrual 
our products are subject to warranty and we provide for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
our warranty accrual is estimated based on historical claims compared to historical revenue and assumes that we have to replace products subject to a claim 
for new products  we use our historical percentage for the appropriate class of product 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for the expected costs of replacing product that was returned in early this level of warranty claims was much higher than what we experienced prior to we have subsequently implemented more stringent testing procedures to reduce the level of warranty claims when compared to the volume shipped 
in the future  as we continue to introduce new products  warranty expenses may increase 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to determine the collectability of our accounts receivable  we continually assess factors such as previous customer transactions and the credit worthiness of the customer 
to date  our accounts receivable write offs have been immaterial 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
in general  such allowances are established for accounts aged over days from the invoice date  unless specific circumstances indicate that the balance is collectible 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
in applying sfas  we are required to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding our ability to realize these assets 
these uncertainties relate primarily to the level of our historical losses and the absence of objective evidence supporting the future realization of these assets 
in the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin no  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  and comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation cost is recognized based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
we have adopted sfas no 
r effective january  we plan to use the modified prospective method of recognition of compensation expense related to share based payments and use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method is expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  although it is not expected to have a material impact on our overall financial position 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be included in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be recorded as expense in 
table of contents we awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non employees 
we account for non cash stock based expense issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force pronouncement no 
 accounting for equity investments that are issued to non employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
for these options and warrants  we recognize the stock based expense over the service period of the underlying awards  based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit the table below sets forth the fluctuations in revenue  cost of revenue and gross profit data for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentage data year ended december  percentage of revenue year ended december  percentage of revenue year to year increase decrease increase decrease percentage revenue product revenue license and engineering service revenue total revenue cost of revenue cost of product revenue cost of license and engineering service revenue total cost of revenue gross profit revenue 
the increase in total revenue during the year ended december  resulted from the growth in sales of our knowledge based processors 
during the year ended december   the units of knowledge based processor shipments increased more than compared to that of the year ended december  revenue from sales to one of cisco systems  inc s contract manufacturers  solectron  represented of total revenue for the years ended december  and december  cost of revenue 
the cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the increased unit shipments of knowledge based processors 
gross profit gross margin 
gross margin increased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the improvement in gross margin in was primarily due to the continued improvements in our production yields for the knowledge based processor products 
version of our knowledge based processors  which was introduced earlier in  produces a higher number of die per wafer as compared to that of the previous version and contributed to the lower overall production costs 
further  gross margin was favorably impacted during the first quarter of by million from the sale of products that had been fully reserved in prior periods and accordingly had no associated cost of revenue 
this amount represented approximately of the gross margin during the year ended december

research and development expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increases in product development and qualification expenses of million  payroll related expenses of million and consulting expenses of million as we continued to invest in the development of the next generation knowledge based processor products as well as new non knowledge based processor products 
in addition  depreciation expense and software maintenance expense increased by million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  as we purchased software licenses to support our research and development efforts 
during the year ended december   we also incurred million of expenses associated with our new design center in bangalore  india  which consisted primarily of payroll related costs for engineers 
the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to increases in directors and officers insurance premium of million  payroll related costs of million  accounting and consulting expenses of million  investor relations expense of million  sales commission of million and state and local taxes of million 
the increases in directors and officers insurance premium and investor relations expenses occured subsequent to our initial public offering in july the increase in payroll related costs was due to increased headcount to support our growing operations and the accrual of management bonuses pursuant to an incentive bonus plan  which was adopted for fiscal the increase in accounting and consulting expenses primarily related to our on going effort to document  evaluate and test our system of internal control over financial reporting as we prepare to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in commission expense was the result of a significant sales increase during the year ended december  the increase in state and local taxes was primarily due to the increased business activities in the states where we conduct business 
the increases in expenses were offset by the release of the allowance for bad debt of million as we continue to improve cash collections 
the remainder of the fluctuation in selling  general and administrative expenses was caused by individually minor items 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense represents amortization of deferred stock based compensation that was recorded in connection with the pre ipo grants of stock options with exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock 
stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the exercise price of the option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants  which is amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
we plan to use the modified prospective method of recognition of compensation expense related to share based payments and use the black scholes option 
table of contents pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be included in operating expenses in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million  of which approximately million is expected to be recorded as expense in if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our operating expenses will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in as part of our regular equity compensation program 
the value of these grants is not included in the amount above  and the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted as part of our compensation program and the then current fair values

the net interest and other income of million generated during the year ended december  was due to a higher average cash and investment balance during the period and higher market yields for our chosen investments 
the higher average cash and investment balance during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the cash generated from operating activities  which totaled million during fiscal the higher interest expense during the year ended december  resulted primarily from the accelerated amortization of beneficial conversion feature and warrants that were originally recorded in connection with the issuance of promissory notes in march the promissory notes were repaid in full in july  and accordingly  the remaining value of beneficial conversion feature at the time of repayment was entirely charged to interest expense 
during the year ended december   amortization of beneficial conversion feature and warrant fair values totaled million 
interest expense for the year ended december  also included the amounts associated with the outstanding balance under the lines of credit 
all outstanding amounts under the lines of credit and convertible promissory notes were paid off in july and our credit lines expired in october

the cost of revenue increased to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the increased unit shipments of knowledge based processors 
during the second half of the year ended december   we reassessed the warranty accrual requirements based on our most recent warranty expense data as our manufacturing yield improved to projected levels 
as a result of this reassessment  we released approximately million of warranty accrual to cost of sales during the third quarter of fiscal we also recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million during the year ended december  as we determined that a portion of inventory related to our previous generation products was unsalable 
the cost of revenue for the year ended december  was adversely affected by the low manufacturing yield of our products due to cisco s applying more rigorous testing on their networking systems that identified certain situation in which our products failed to perform to specification 
as a result  cisco returned a portion of those products under the terms of our standard warranty 
we recorded charges of approximately million in order to write down the carrying value of our inventory to market and establish reserves for warranty and adverse purchase commitments  which resulted in the negative gross margin 
to improve yield  we modified the design of our knowledge based processors 
to date  the products incorporating the design modification have met and continue to meet cisco s testing and qualification requirements and our production yields have improved to projected levels 
gross profit gross margin 
gross margin increased to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  excluding the charges related to cisco returns of million described above  gross margin for the year ended december  would have been 
the improvement in gross margin from to  excluding the effect of cisco returns in  was primarily due to the sales growth of knowledge based processors  which have a higher average selling price than other products  and continued improvements in production yields for these products 
further  gross margin in was favorably impacted by the sale of million of products that had been fully reserved in prior periods and accordingly had no associated costs of revenue

research and development expenses decreased during the year ended december  primarily due to decreases in product development and qualification expenses of million and depreciation expense of million 
during the year ended december   product development and qualification expenses were significantly higher as we began to ramp up the production of knowledge based processor products 
the decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to some of our software design tools being fully depreciated prior to the decreases in product development and qualification expenses and depreciation expense were offset by the increases in consulting fees of million  common expense allocation of million and mask expenses of million 
the remainder of the change in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december  primarily due to the increases in payroll related expenses of million  directors and officers insurance premium of million  audit and legal fees of million  consulting fees of million  commission expense of million and trade show expenses of million 
the increase in payroll related expenses was caused by the increase in headcount to support our growing operations 
the increase in commission expense was due to the increase in sales of our knowledge based processors in the increases in consulting and trade show expenses were due to the increased sales and marketing activities to promote our knowledge based processors 
the remainder of the change in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted from individually minor items 
stock based compensation expense 
the increase in stock based compensation amortization was primarily due to grants of stock options prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock 
stock based compensation expense is based on the difference between the exercise price of the option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants

the significant increase in interest and other income expense  net during the year ended december  was primarily due to the amortization of beneficial conversion feature and fair value of warrants that were originally recorded in connection with the issuance of promissory notes in march both the beneficial conversion feature and fair value of warrants of million and million  respectively  were originally being amortized over the term of the promissory notes 
however  the promissory notes were repaid in full in july  at which time the remaining value of beneficial conversion feature and warrants were charged entirely to interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents which totaled million 
our line of credit for million with silicon valley bank expired on october   and was not renewed as management determined that our currently available liquid resources were adequate for our operational needs for the foreseeable future 
the table below in thousands sets forth the key components of cash flow for the years ended december   and year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities generated net cash of million 
for cash provided by operating activities  our primary source was net income of million  adjusted for non cash items of million primarily related to depreciation  amortization of deferred stock based compensation and provision for inventory reserves 
the provision for inventory reserves of million was primarily related to the write off of approximately million of inventory during the second quarter of the inventory write off was related to specific inventory that we mutually agreed with our foundry partner did not meet specifications 
this write off did not impact our cash flows during the year ended december  as we received wafer credits from the foundry partner for the same amount 
cash was also generated from increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts receivable 
table of contents resulted from our continued effort to improve cash collections 
the increases in accounts payable and accruals were primarily due to the growth of our overall operations and the timing of vendor invoice payments 
the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was for inventory  which increased as we ramped up our production volume in order to meet our customers increasing demand for knowledge based processors 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december  cash was primarily used to purchase research and development design tools and computer equipment to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we expect to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december  the primary sources of cash were the proceeds from exercises of stock options and repayment of stockholder notes received  which were offset by repayment of capital lease obligations 
cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities used net cash of million 
cash used in operating activities consisted of a net loss of million adjusted for non cash items primarily related to depreciation  amortization of stock based compensation and interest expense  which included the amortization and write off of discount related to the issuance of promissory notes 
the primary use of cash for operating activities during the year ended december  was for our inventory  which increased as we ramped up our production volume in order to meet our customers increasing demand for our knowledge based processors 
in addition  the significant growth in our product sales in increased accounts receivable and lowered our operating cash flows 
cash was also used to reduce our accrued liabilities as we settled our product warranty obligations during the period and used a portion of our initial public offering proceeds to reduce our overall liability balance 
other uses of cash for operating activities included an increase in prepaid and other assets due to the payment of a directors and officers insurance premium in connection with our initial public offering  and a decrease in deferred revenue as we completed our obligation under the agreement with micron 
cash used for activities related to inventory  accounts receivable  accrued liabilities  prepaid and other assets and deferred revenue was offset by an increase in accounts payable due to the growth in our operations 
our investing activities provided net cash of million during the year ended december  cash was provided by the sale of short term investments and the reduction in restricted cash as our amended line of credit agreement with a bank no longer required a restricted cash deposit 
cash provided by the sale of short term investments and the reduction in restricted cash was offset by the acquisition of property and equipment totaling million 
the property and equipment expenditures were primarily for purchases of computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december  the primary source of cash was the net proceeds received in connection with our initial public offering of million 
the other sources of cash included the issuance of convertible promissory notes  repayment of stockholder notes received  proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants and borrowings under the line of credit 
cash provided by these activities was offset by repayment of convertible promissory notes  repayment of the outstanding balance under the working capital line and the payments for capital lease obligations 
cash flows during the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million 
our reported net loss of million in was offset by non cash charges of approximately million primarily due to 
table of contents stock based compensation 
cash used in operations during included an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from product sales late in we reduced our cash utilization during the year in part through an increase in accrued liabilities of million  which primarily related to unfavorable purchase commitments and warranty charges for the cost of replacement parts 
we also increased inventories during this period by million as we began ramping production of our knowledge based processors for cisco  but this increase in gross inventories was significantly offset by a million provision for inventory and adverse purchase commitments 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we used million in cash related to bank financings as the cash was reclassified as restricted cash  million in purchases of property and equipment and a net increase of million in short term investments 
cash provided by financing activities was million in during  we received proceeds of approximately million from bank financings 
we repaid bank debt totaling million 
capital resources we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents balance of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
however  if we do not meet our plan  we could be required  or might elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in the interests of our company 
contractual obligations as of december   our principal commitments consisted of operating and capital lease payments  which are summarized below in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations wafer purchases total in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 

table of contents indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include agreements to indemnify our customers with respect to liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our products  obligation to indemnify our lessors under facility lease agreements  and obligation to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  is indefinite 
we have not recorded any liability for any such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 
under master purchase agreements signed with cisco in november  we have agreed to indemnify cisco for costs incurred in rectifying epidemic failures  up to the greater of on a per claim basis of all amounts paid to us by cisco during the preceding months or million  plus replacement costs 
if we are required to make payments under the indemnity  our operating results may be adversely affected
