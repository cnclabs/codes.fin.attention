item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are principally a motor carrier  also commonly referred to as a trucking company 
we offer various transportation services to customers in the united states  canada and mexico 
our services primarily involve the over the road movement of freight 
in the united states  we sometimes also arrange for the use of railroads to transport our loaded trailers between major cities 
most of our revenue is from service which is order based  meaning that we separately bill our customers for each shipment 
a minority of our revenue is from services which are asset based  meaning that we bill our customer for the use of a truck and driver or the use of a trailer for a period of time  without regard to the number of shipments hauled 
we also refer to our truck and driver asset based service as dedicated fleets  because in these arrangements  the trucks and drivers involved are dedicated for use by a specific customer on a full time basis 
during the latter part of  many of our resources were engaged in providing relief to the regions affected by hurricanes katrina and rita 
we provided dedicated fleet services in these hurricane relief efforts  which contributed revenue of million 
we also provided refrigerated trailers  which were rented on a per day basis for storage and transportation of perishable items 
such hurricane related trailer rentals generated million of revenue during the final three months of order based services are either full truckload or less than truckload ltl 
our trailers are designed to carry up to  pounds of freight 
shipments weighing  pounds or more are full truckload  while shipments of less than that amount are classified as ltl 
customers let us know that they have shipments requiring transportation and inform us as to any special requirements  such as an identification of the type of product to be shipped  the origin and destination of the load and the expected time by which delivery must occur 
we inform our customers of our availability to haul the freight and of the price we will charge 
if these fit with the needs of the customer  we schedule the freight for pickup 
shipments have three stages pick up  linehaul and delivery 
the linehaul stage is over the road and involves longer distances 
most of our full truckload shipments will have all of these stages performed by the same truck 
ltl shipments typically involve different trucks for each of the three stages 
for ltl  the linehaul stage may also involve more than one truck as the freight moves within our network of ltl terminals 
for example  an ltl truck bound from los angeles to dallas may carry shipments destined for dallas  chicago and atlanta 
once the truck arrives in dallas  the freight for chicago and atlanta will be sorted and sent out from dallas on different trucks to those cities with other ltl shipments that originated in dallas or arrived there on trucks from other areas of the country 
a linehaul load of ltl typically weighs  to  pounds and is comprised of between and individual shipments 
we operate under three primary brand names  ffe transportation services ffe  lisa motor lines lml and american eagle lines ael 
ffe and lml specialize in products that require temperature control 
most shipments require the maintenance of a cold temperature ranging from minus degrees to plus degrees fahrenheit 
examples include perishable food  beverages  candy  pharmaceuticals  photographic supplies and electronics 
other products require maintenance of a warm temperature in the colder months to prevent freezing while in transit  such as nursery stock and liquid products 
ffe conducts all of our ltl business and also has significant order based and asset based full truckload operations 
lml specializes in order based full truckload operations 
ael serves the market for order based and asset based full truckload activities that do not require temperature control 
the assets we must have for temperature controlled service are costly to acquire and maintain 
the rates we charge for our temperature controlled services are usually higher than other companies who offer no temperature controlled services 
many products that require protection from the heat during the warmer months of the year do not require protection during the colder months 
therefore  during the warmer months  demand for our temperature controlled full truckload and ltl services expands 
there are several companies that provide national temperature controlled full truckload services 
we know of no other company providing nationwide ltl temperature controlled service 
the vast majority of trucking companies that are nationwide in scope  like our ael brand  offer only full truckload service with no temperature control 
therefore  the markets that are served by ael tend to be very price competitive and generally lack the level of seasonality present in our ffe and lml operations 
because consumer demand for products requiring temperature control is often less sensitive to economic cycles  revenue from ffe and lml tends to be less volatile during such cycles 
ltl linehaul revenue increased by during as compared to  and by during as compared to the trucking business is highly competitive 
during  the last year for which data is available  there were several thousand companies operating in all sectors of the trucking business in the united states 
among those  the top five companies offering primarily temperature controlled services collectively generated revenue of billion 
the next such companies collectively generated revenues of billion 
in  we ranked fourth in terms of revenue generated among all temperature controlled motor carriers 
we have nearly  active customers for our trucking business 
we generally collect cash for our services between and days after our service is provided 
trucking companies of our size face challenges to be successful 
costs for labor  maintenance and insurance typically rise every year 
fuel prices can increase or decrease quite rapidly 
due to the high level of competitiveness  it is often difficult to pass these rising costs on to our customers 
over the past few years  many trucking companies have ceased operations  resulting in a reduced number of alternatives and increasing the awareness among customers that price increases for trucking services are likely 
throughout  we more aggressively sought and obtained price increases from our customers 
these efforts will continue into and beyond

return to table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have several critical accounting estimates 
these require a more significant amount of management judgement than the other accounting policies we employ 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue and expense recognition in all of our freight operations  we recognize revenue and all estimated direct operating expenses such as fuel and labor on the date we pick up shipments from our customers 
in  the emerging issues tax force eitf of the financial accounting standards board promulgated issue  revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process eitf 
in  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which provides that eitf sets forth the revenue and expense recognition methods that may be used in our industry 
according to eitf and sab  our manner of recognizing revenue and expenses for freight in process is acceptable 
the other methods generally defer the recognition of revenue and expenses to as late as the date on which delivery of the shipments is completed 
we have consistently utilized our manner of revenue and expense recognition since we began operations in because our consolidated financial statements contain accruals for revenue and all associated estimated direct expenses as of the beginning and the end of each reporting period  if we were to change our manner of recognizing revenue and associated estimated direct expenses to one of the other methods allowed by eitf and sab  our results of operations would not be substantially affected 
in such an event  each period s revenue and expenses would be adjusted to include in revenue and expense amounts from freight in process at the beginning of the period and to exclude from revenue and expense those amounts from freight in process at the end of the same period 
these amounts would essentially offset one another from period to period  resulting in minimal impact to our revenue or our operating or net income 
revenue from equipment rental is recognized on a per day basis over the term of the associated rental agreements 
personal and work related injuries the trucking business involves risk of injury to our employees and the public 
prior to  we retained the first  and million of these risks  respectively  on a per occurrence basis 
due primarily to conditions in the insurance marketplace  during we retained the first million for work related injuries and the first million for public liability risk 
that arrangement continued during the first six months of from mid until mid  our retention for public liability claims was lowered to million and we were fully insured for losses between million and million  but we shared equally with the insurer losses from liability claims between million and million 
beginning in mid until mid  our liability policies also contained a million deductible 
we presently also retain of the losses between million and million 
since  our retention for work related injuries has been million 
in may of  we renewed our liability policies to expire in mid throughout each of the years in the three year period ended december   we have been fully insured above million to a policy limit of million for liability claims 
because of our large public liability and work related injury retentions  the potential adverse impact a single occurrence can have on our results is significant 
when an event involving potential liability occurs  our internal staff of risk management professionals determines the range of most probable outcomes 
based on that estimate  we record a reserve in our financial statements during the period in which the event occurred 
as additional information becomes available  we increase or reduce the amount of this reserve 
we also maintain additional reserves for public liability and work related injury events that may have been incurred but not reported 
as of december   our reserves for personal injury  work related injury  cargo and other claims against us aggregated nearly million 
if we were to change our estimates making up those reserves up or down by in the aggregate  the impact on net income would have been about million  and diluted net income per share of common stock would have been impacted by 
estimate of uncollectible accounts we extend trade credit to our customers 
we also establish a reserve to represent our estimate of accounts that will not ultimately be collected 
once we conclude that a specific invoice is unlikely to be paid by the customer  we charge the invoice against the reserve 
we estimate the amount of our bad debt reserve based on the composite age of our receivables and historical trends regarding such uncollectible amounts 
during  the amount of our bad debt reserve did not change appreciably and the amount of receivables that were more than days old declined by approximately million 
significant changes in our receivables aging could impact our profits and financial condition 
as of december   our reserve for uncollectible accounts was million 
if our estimate were to change by  net income would have been impacted by about  or per diluted share of common stock 
deferred taxes our net deferred tax liability of million is stated net of offsetting deferred tax assets 
the assets consist of anticipated future tax deductions for items such as personal and work related injury and bad debt expenses which have been reflected on our financial statements but which are not yet tax deductible 
in total  our deferred tax assets as of december  were about million 
at current federal tax rates  we will need to generate about million in future taxable income in order to fully realize our deferred tax assets 
we believe it probable that we will generate sufficient taxable income in and beyond to realize the remainder of our deferred tax assets 
if our expectation of such realizability diminishes  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance on our balance sheet 
that could diminish our net income in future periods

for a complete description of the amounts that were restated or reclassified  please see note to the financial statements included as item to this report 
freight revenue our freight revenue is derived from five types of transactions 
linehaul revenue is order based and earned by transporting cargo for our customers using tractors and trailers that we control by ownership  long term leases or by agreements with independent contractors sometimes referred to as owner operators 
within our linehaul freight service portfolio we offer both full truckload and less than truckload services 
over of our ltl linehaul shipments must be temperature controlled to prevent damage to the cargo 
we operate fleets that focus on refrigerated or temperature controlled less than truckload ltl  on full truckload temperature controlled shipments and on full truckload non refrigerated or dry shipments 
of the shipments transported by our temperature controlled fleets during  about were dry commodities 
our dedicated fleet operation consists of fleets of tractors and trailers that haul only freight for a specific customer 
dedicated fleet revenue is asset based 
customers typically pay us weekly for trucks assigned to their service 
during the fourth quarter of  we provided refrigerated trailers  which were rented on a per day basis  for storage and transportation of perishable items to regions affected by hurricanes rita and katrina 
such hurricane related trailer rentals generated million of revenue 
income from equipment rental also includes amounts we charge to independent contractors for the use of trucks which we own and lease to the owner operator 
during the last four months of  many of our resources were engaged in providing relief to the regions affected by hurricanes katrina and rita 
we provided dedicated fleet services  which contributed revenue of million 
the rates we charge for our freight services include fuel adjustment charges 
in periods when the price we incur for diesel fuel is high  we raise our prices in an effort to recover this increase from our customers 
the opposite is true when fuel prices decline

particularly in response to the rapidly escalating price of diesel fuel  we have begun to obtain compensation from our customers for empty miles 
our linehaul rates are typically related to providing service between an origin and a destination 
often  it is necessary for trucks to run empty  traveling long distances from the city of their last destination to the city of their next origin in order to reposition the equipment 
historically  the expenses we incurred for such repositioning activities were not passed through to the customer 
our trucks currently average between five and seven miles per gallon 
between december  and december   the average per gallon price we incurred for fuel rose by  to 
due to this rapid increase  we have determined that we can no longer bear of the costs of repositioning  and many of our customers have agreed to absorb at least some of our incremental expense 
our revenue from such repositioning activities is accounted for as linehaul revenue 
full truckload linehaul revenue for the years ended december  and increased by million and million  respectively  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
during  the average miles of our full truckload shipments did not change appreciably 
the number of full truckload linehaul shipments during declined by  to  the decline was primarily related to the deployment of assets previously assigned to linehaul service to dedicated fleet service  the revenue from which improved by million during  as compared to the negative impact on full truckload linehaul revenue from the decline in the number of shipments was more than offset by the rate increases that we implemented during the year 
during  our full truckload revenue per loaded mile increased by to  which was tempered somewhat by a slight increase in our empty mile ratio 
ltl linehaul revenue for the years ended december  and increased by million and million  respectively  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
ltl operations offer the opportunity to earn higher revenue on a per mile and per hundredweight basis than do full truckload operations  but the level of investment and fixed costs associated with ltl activities significantly exceed those of full truckload activities 
accordingly  as ltl revenue fluctuates  many costs remain fixed  leveraging the impact from such revenue fluctuations on our operating income 
during and  as ltl activity and revenue rose  many ltl related costs remained static 
during  ltl linehaul revenue increased by million to million  despite a decline in the number of ltl shipments 
the average weight of such shipments increased by 
the remainder of s increase in ltl revenue is a result of rate increases we implemented beginning in the second half of and continued through the end of we continuously assess the performance of our ltl operations 
as a result  we periodically alter the frequency at which we service locations where freight volumes have declined and change the mix of our company operated vs 
independent contractor provided trucks in order to more closely match our operating costs to the level of our ltl revenue

at december   our entire ltl fleet consisted of tractors  as compared to at the end of and at the end of when the level of our ltl activity increases during peak times of the year  we often re deploy full truckload trucks to handle the increase 
the number of trucks in our full truckload company operated fleet rose by to  during as of december   there were  tractors in our full truckload company operated fleet  as compared to  at the end of continued emphasis will be placed on improving the efficiency and the utilization of our fleets through enhanced driver training and retention  by reducing the percentage of non revenue producing miles  by extending the average loaded miles per shipment and through expansion of dedicated fleet operations 
during  the federal agency that regulates motor carrier safety began to enforce new hours of service hos rules  which limit the number of hours truck drivers may work and drive in a shift 
time in a shift spent by a driver in fueling  loading and waiting to load or unload freight count as non driving work hours 
the old hos rules were introduced in  and the new rules are intended by the government to reflect more closely the equipment and roads in use today  as compared to years ago 
the new rules generally expand from to the number of hours that a person can drive an over the road truck in a shift  but reduce from to the number of hours such a person can work during the same shift 
also  under the old hos rules  time spent in the middle of a shift waiting to load or unload did not count as hours worked  but such time does count as hours worked under the new hos rules 
the new rules also extend from to the number of hours that drivers must rest between on duty shifts 
in order to compensate our drivers and offset other expenses from diminished asset utilization  we are seeking compensation from our customers  such as rate increases and detention fees 
such detention fees are designed to motivate our customers to expedite the loading and unloading of their freight  thereby maximizing the number of hours that our drivers can drive during a work shift 
our full truckload fleets use satellite technology to enhance efficiency and customer service 
location updates of each tractor are provided by this network and we exchange dispatch  fuel and other information with the driver by way of satellite 
revenue from our freight brokerage operation increased by million and declined by million during and each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
during  we significantly expanded our freight brokerage  which enables us to better adjust our ability to transport loads offered to us but for which we have no available equipment 
our brokerage engages a third party licensed trucking company to haul the freight 
our brokerage bills the customer and pays the third party trucking company 
during  we determined that some of the specialists involved in this operation would be replaced  a process that remained incomplete at year end accordingly  freight brokerage revenue and associated expenses principally for purchased transportation declined during  as compared to throughout and  we sought and obtained rate increases from our customers in an effort to compensate us for increased costs  and to reflect diminished capacity of the trucking industry to meet expanding customer demand for trucking services 
those rate increases were the principal contributor to increased per mile revenue 
factors mitigating the increased per mile revenue during as compared to included fewer loaded  or revenue producing miles  for such shipments and a moderate increase in the proportion of our empty  or non revenue producing  miles to loaded miles 
recent high operating expenses  particularly for maintenance and fuel  has resulted in a sharp decline in the number of independent contractors providing equipment to the trucking industry 
our ability to mitigate this industry wide trend by expanding our company operated fleets has been constrained by an industry wide lack of drivers qualified to operate the equipment 
page of 
return to table of contents freight operating expenses changes in the proportion of revenue from full truckload versus ltl shipments  as well as in the mix of company provided versus independent contractor provided equipment and in the mix of leased versus owned equipment  contribute to variations among operating and interest expenses

the number of such miles increased during and  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
the increased number of miles contributed to the increases in driver salaries and per diem expenses during both and employee dedicated fleet drivers are typically paid by the hour or by the day 
during and  we added trucks to our dedicated fleet operations 
those increases also contributed to increases in driver salaries and per diem expenses 
also impacting the and increases in driver salaries and per diem expenses were changes in the level of shipments  miles and hundredweight in our ltl operation 
drivers hauling ltl typically earn a higher wage than do their full truckload counterparts 
ltl wages are based on a number of factors including the amount of on duty time  miles driven  hundredweight hauled and in route stops to load and unload freight 
during and  respectively  ltl miles increased  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
at the same time  hundredweight transported also increased 
the number of ltl shipments did not change appreciably during but declined by during to the extent that ltl freight is hauled by employee drivers  as opposed to owner operators  the aforementioned changes served to increase ltl driver salaries  wages and per diem expenses during and  respectively  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
we sponsor bonus and incentive programs for our employees and management 
bonus payments are based on the operating profitability of our company 
no bonuses were paid based on our results 
for and due to improved performance  our employees and management earned bonuses aggregating approximately million and million  respectively  which resulted in the increases in non driver salaries expense 
we also sponsor a k wrap plan which enables employees to defer a portion of their current salaries to their post retirement years 
because the wrap plan s assets are held by a grantor or rabbi trust  we are required to include the wrap plan s assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   such assets included approximately  shares of our common stock  which are classified as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets 
the trust also holds assets other than our common stock 
such investments are included in other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to value the assets and liabilities of the wrap plan at market value on our periodic balance sheets  but we are precluded from reflecting the treasury stock portion of the wrap plan s assets at market value 
when the market value of our common stock rises  this results in upward pressure on non driver salaries and wage expense 
the opposite is true when our common stock price falls 
the price of our common stock rose during  but fell during the effect of those changes resulted in salaries  wages and related expenses being  higher during and  lower during also  during and  our executive bonus and phantom stock plan was partially denominated in approximately  and  respectively  phantom shares of our stock  the liability for which is also determined by the value of our stock

return to table of contents costs associated with work related injuries rose by during as compared to and diminished by in as compared to self insured work related injuries incurred by drivers were the primary contributors to this expense 
the number of our employee drivers did not change appreciably during we share the cost of health insurance with our employees 
for the past several years  we have experienced double digit percentage health insurance cost increases 
during mid  we increased both the amounts employees pay to participate and the amount of medical costs that must be borne by our employees 
this helped us mitigate the rate at which our costs have increased 
during non recessionary economic periods  we typically have difficulty attracting qualified employee drivers for our full truckload operations 
such shortages increase costs of employee driver compensation  training and recruiting 
significant resources are continually devoted to recruiting and retaining qualified employee drivers and to improving their job satisfaction 
during and  the supply of qualified drivers continued to tighten 
with increasing frequency and magnitude  our competitors often increase their employee driver pay scales 
we monitor such events and consider increases should the need arise 
the last such increase we implemented was during purchased transportation purchased transportation expense declined by  during and increased by million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year

independent contractor provided equipment generated  and of our full truckload linehaul revenue during  and  respectively 
independent contractors provide a tractor that they own to transport freight on our behalf 
contractors pay for the cost of operating their tractors  including but not limited to the expense of fuel  labor  taxes and maintenance 
we pay independent contractors amounts generally determined by reference to the revenue associated with their activities 
at the beginning of  there were such tractors in the full truckload fleet 
by the end of  there were such tractors 
at december  and  there were and  respectively 
as the number of these trucks fluctuates  so does the amount of revenue generated by such units 
purchased transportation expense related to ltl linehaul services fell during but rose by a nearly equal amount during this resulted from fluctuations in the amount of ltl freight transported by company provided equipment relative to equipment provided by independent contractors 
in providing our full truckload linehaul service  we often engage railroads to transport shipments between major cities 
in such an arrangement called intermodal service  loaded trailers are transported to a rail facility and placed on flat cars for transport to their destination 
on arrival  we will pick up the trailer and deliver the freight to the consignee 
intermodal service is generally less costly than using one of our own trucks for such movements  but other factors also influence our decision to utilize intermodal services 
during and  the number of intermodal full truckload shipments increased by and  each as compared to the immediately preceding year  as many of our normally full truckload trucks were occupied in providing other services such as ltl and dedicated fleet activities 
these factors contributed to our increase of intermodal services in the transport of full truckload freight 
purchased transportation expenses related to our intermodal services providers continued to increase during  having expanded by million and million during and  respectively 
purchased transportation expense for full truckload linehaul service has remained substantially unchanged since this reflects an industry wide shortage of trucks provided by independent contractors 
due in part to that shortage  we have increased our reliance on intermodal providers to transport freight that might otherwise have been hauled by independent contractor provided equipment

this practice added million  million and million  respectively  to our purchased transportation expense during  and when we book an order in our brokerage  we arrange for an unaffiliated licensed trucking company to haul the freight 
we set the price to be paid by the customer and bear the risk should the customer fail to pay us for the shipment 
we determine which trucking company will haul the load and negotiate with them the fee we will pay  which represents freight brokerage purchased transportation expenses 
purchased transportation expense associated with our freight brokerage increased by million and declined by million during and  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
those changes resulted from corresponding changes in the amounts of freight brokerage revenue 
fuel fuel expense increased by million during and million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year 
fuel expenses represent purchases of fuel we make in connection with company operated equipment 
independent contractors see purchased transportation are responsible for all of their own operating expenses  including fuel

the following table summarizes and compares the relationship between fuel expense and freight linehaul revenue during each of the years in the three year period ended december  dollar amounts in millions total linehaul and dedicated fleet revenue fuel expense fuel expense as a percent of total linehaul and dedicated fleet revenue fuel expense depicts the cost of purchasing fuel to transport freight with company operated equipment 
a significant percentage of our freight is transported with equipment provided by independent contractors 
the cost of independent contractors fuel is not included in our fuel expense 
the amounts we pay independent contractors are classified as purchased transportation expense 
in times when fuel prices are high  to the extent we are able to obtain fuel surcharges from our customers  we compensate independent contractors on a load by load basis for their increased fuel expense 
such additional compensation is also classified as purchased transportation expense 
accordingly our fuel expenses exclude the fuel expense incurred by our independent contractor provided fleets 
most of the increases in our fuel expense were related to the price of diesel fuel for our company operated fleet of tractors and trailers 
during  our average price per gallon of diesel fuel increased by about  as compared to during and  the average price of diesel fuel increased by an additional and  respectively  over the level  for a cumulative three year increase of 
because fuel adjustment charges do not fully compensate us or our independent contractors for the increased fuel costs  fuel price volatility impacts our profitability 
we have in place a number of strategies that mitigate  but do not eliminate  the impact of such volatility 
pursuant to the contracts and tariffs by which our freight rates are determined  those rates in most cases automatically fluctuate as diesel fuel prices rise and fall because of the fuel adjustment charges 
factors that prevent us from fully recovering fuel cost increases include the presence of deadhead empty miles  tractor engine idling and fuel to power our trailer refrigeration units 
such fuel consumption often cannot be attributable to a particular load and  therefore  there is no revenue to which a fuel adjustment may be applied 
also  our fuel adjustment charges are computed by reference to federal government indices that are released weekly for the preceding week 
when prices are rising  the price we incur in a given week is more than the price the government reports for the preceding week 
accordingly  we are unable to recover the excess of the current week s actual price over the preceding week s indexed price 
with regard to fuel expenses for company operated equipment  we attempt to further mitigate the impact of fluctuating fuel costs by operating more fuel efficient tractors and aggressively managing fuel purchasing 
we use computer software to optimize our routing and fuel purchasing 
the software enables us to select the most efficient route for a trip 
it also assists us in deciding on a real time basis how much fuel to buy at a particular fueling station

with regard to our newer tractors  during we have incurred significantly higher expenses to maintain tractor engines than was the case in prior years 
such engines use anti pollution devices that cause the engine to run at higher temperatures  which creates more stress and results in higher maintenance expenses 
we are working with the manufacturers of the engines and the tractors to find a solution to these problems 
tire expense increased by million during and declined by million during  each as compared to the immediately preceding year

during and  we engaged the services of independent actuaries to help us improve the process by which we estimate the amount of our work related and public liability claims reserves 
such estimates address the amount of the claims settlements as well as legal and other fees associated with attaining such settlements 
as a result of the actuarial studies  during  we increased our reserves for such claims by approximately million 
about half of s increase in per mile insurance costs was due to this study 
the study did not significantly add to our insurance costs 
during and the first several months of  we retained the risk for liability claims up to million 
from june  through may  we retained the first million of our liability risk  our insurance company assumed the risk in full above our million deductible to million  and the insurance company and we shared the risk equally between million and million for each occurrence

losses between million and million are shared by us and by the insurer 
we are fully insured for losses for each occurrence between million and million 
we have accrued for our estimated costs related to our liability claims

as additional information becomes available  adjustments are made 
accrued claims liabilities include all reserves for over the road accidents  work related injuries  self insured employee medical expenses and cargo losses 
employee related insurance costs are included in salaries  wages and related expenses in our statements of income 
the actuarial reports issued to us during provided us with factors we will continue to use to estimate expected costs associated with claims development and claims handling expenses 
it is probable that the estimates we have accrued for at any point in time will change in the future 
claims and insurance expenses can vary significantly from year to year 
the amount of open claims is significant 
there can be no assurance that these claims will be settled without a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations 
other and miscellaneous expense gains on the disposition of equipment were million in the year ended december  such gains were million during and million during the periodic amount of such gains depends primarily upon conditions in the market for previously owned equipment and on the quantity of retired equipment sold 
we usually pre arrange the retirement sales value when we accept delivery of a new tractor 
fluctuations in the market value of our leased equipment do not impact the pre arranged retirement value of tractors presently in our fleet  but softness in the market for used equipment could diminish future pre arranged retirement values 
that may require us to increase the amount of depreciation and rental expense we incur in and beyond 
we do not expect used equipment market prices to alter our current depreciation or rental expense related to trailers  but changes in the trailer market values could impact the amount of gains on sale of trailers in future periods 
miscellaneous expenses were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
during and  respectively  we incurred approximately million and million in expenses and professional fees associated with our efforts to comply with the internal control provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of non freight operation during  we sold the principal operating assets of our former non freight business to the management of that business 
in connection with that transaction  we provided financial assistance to the buyers and we retained ownership in the buyer s entity 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we continue to consolidate the financial statements of the buyer

our marginal tax rate for federal and state taxes has been about since  but our effective income tax rate provision for income taxes as a percent of pre tax income was  and for  and  respectively 
this rate is impacted by the presence of non taxable income and non tax deductible costs in our pre tax income 
non taxable income reduces the effective tax rate and non deductible costs will increase the effective rate 
during  we had a non taxable gain from the sale of a life insurance policy of nearly million  but the downward impact of that gain on our effective tax rate was more than offset by the upward impact of non deductible expenses 
the largest of our non deductible expenses are associated with travel expenses and per diem travel allowances for our employee drivers 
liquidity and capital resources certain amounts for have been restated or reclassified from the amounts previously reported 
for a complete description of the amounts that were restated or reclassified  please see note to the financial statements included as item to this report 
debt and working capital cash from our freight revenue is typically collected between and days after the service has been provided 
we continually seek to accelerate our collection of accounts receivable to enhance our liquidity and minimize our debt 
our freight business is highly dependent on the use of fuel  labor  operating supplies and equipment provided by owner operators 
we are typically obligated to pay for these resources within seven to fifteen days after we use them  so our payment cycle is a significantly shorter interval compared to our collection cycle 
this disparity between cash payments to our suppliers and cash receipts from our customers can create significant needs for borrowed funds to finance our working capital  especially during the peak time of our fiscal year 
our primary needs for capital resources are to finance working capital  expenditures for property and equipment and  from time to time  acquisitions 
working capital investment typically increases during periods of sales expansion when higher levels of receivables occur 
during  we entered into a new credit agreement with two banks 
the credit agreement was amended during december  june  august  april  march and may it expires on june  we expect to renew or replace the agreement and extend the expiration date during debt may be secured by our revenue equipment  trade accounts receivable and inventories 
as of december   we were using none of the credit facility for borrowed funds  but were using million of the facility as security for letters of credit  for a total utilization of million of the million available to us 
accordingly  our remaining availability was million at the end of as amended  the credit agreement contains several restrictive covenants  including the ratio of our annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rental and any non cash expenses from stock option activity ebitdar to the amount of our annual fixed charges may not be less than fixed charges generally include interest payments  rental expense  taxes paid and any portion of long term debt presently due but not paid 
the ratio of our funded debt to ebitdar may not exceed funded debt generally includes the amount borrowed under the credit agreement or similar arrangements  letters of credit secured by the credit agreement and the aggregate minimum amount of operating lease payments we are obligated to pay in the future 
the yearly sum of our income plus taxes and non recurring or extraordinary expense as defined in the credit agreement must be a positive amount 
our tangible net worth tnw must remain an amount greater than million plus of the positive amounts of our quarterly net income for each fiscal quarter which ends after june  tnw is generally defined as our net shareholders equity  minus intangible and certain other assets plus of any cash we receive from the issuance of equity securities 
we may not enter into a merger or acquire another entity without the prior consent of our banks 
the annual amount of our net expenditures for property and equipment may not be more than million after taking into account the amounts we receive from the sale of such assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants and we project that our compliance will remain intact during such terms include a provision that we provide the banks with audited financial statements within days of the end of each year 
december  statements would have been due by march  during march of  it became apparent that we would be unable to meet that requirement

as compared to  factors contributing to the improvement in operating cash flows included s higher net income  higher depreciation and amortization expense  higher deferred income tax expense  higher liability for accounts payable and s higher accrued payroll liability 
the decline in operating cash flows between and was primarily due to higher accounts receivable and lower accounts payable  which were offset by an improvement in net income and other components of cash flows from operating activities 
as of december   our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million  as compared to million as of december  this change  which was mostly related to higher accounts receivable at december   is the principal reason behind s lower year to date cash flows provided by operating activities 
accounts receivable increased by million between december  and  due to a increase in revenue between the quarters ended on those dates 
regarding cash flows from investing activities  expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in  million in and million during cash proceeds from the sale of retired equipment were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in addition  we financed  through operating leases  the addition of revenue equipment valued at approximately million in  million in and million during during  much of our cash flow from operating activities was used to pay down our debt  from million to million 
that resulted in s net cash used in financing activities to be million  as compared to s million 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock or re issuance of treasury stock both in connection with the exercise of stock options also served to reduce net cash used in financing activities during the twelve months of during  we expended million for repurchases of our common stock  as compared to million during obligations and commitments the table below sets forth information as to the amounts of our obligations and commitments as well as the year in which they will become due in millions payments due by year total after long term debt and letters of credit purchase obligations operating leases for rentals residual guarantees accounts payable accrued payroll deferred compensation phantom stock rabbi trust total our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of a variable interest entity vie from which we lease tractors 
the vie is under the control of our chairman and chief executive officer 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap require such consolidation for financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  our financial statements reflect the debt of the vie as a financial obligation of the company and the notes to our consolidated financial statements omit from our commitments note the rent payable to the vie

return to table of contents as of december  our debt was zero and letters of credit issued by us for insurance purposes were million 
as of december   we had contracts for construction of a new terminal and to purchase tractors and trailers totaling million during we expect to lease many of the tractors and trailers assets when they are placed into service 
we lease equipment and real estate 
rentals are due under non cancelable operating leases for facilities  tractors and trailers 
our minimum lease payments and residual guarantees do not exceed of the leased asset s cost  the lease terms are for fewer years than of the leased asset s economic life  the leases do not convey ownership to us at the end of the term of the lease and the leases do not contain bargain purchase arrangements 
accordingly  the leases are accounted for as operating leases and rentals are recorded as rent expense over the term of the leases 
facility and trailer leases do not contain guaranteed residual values in favor of the lessors 
most of the tractors we leased prior to and a minority of the tractors we leased since are leased pursuant to agreements under which we have partially guaranteed the assets end of lease term residual value 
tractor leases entered into before typically have month terms  and tractor leases entered into after have either or month terms 
the portions of the residuals we have guaranteed vary from lessor to lessor 
gross residuals are about of the leased asset s historical cost  of which we have guaranteed the first to 
the lessors remain at risk for up to of the remainder of such leased asset s historical cost 
because our lease payments and residual guarantees do not exceed of the tractor s cost  the leases are accounted for as operating leases and rentals are recorded as rent expense over the term of the leases 
offsetting our lease residual guarantees  when our tractors were originally leased  the tractor manufacturer conditionally agreed to repurchase the tractors at the end of the term of the lease 
factors which may limit our ability to recover the amount of the residual guaranty from the manufacturer include specifications as to the physical condition of each tractor  their mechanical performance  each vehicles accumulated mileage  and whether or not we order replacement and additional vehicles from the same manufacturer 
the price to be paid by the manufacturer is generally equal to the full amount of the lessor s residual 
in addition to residual values  our tractor leases contain fair value purchase options 
our agreement with the tractor manufacturer enables  but does not require  us to sell the tractors back to the manufacturer at a future date  should we own them at such time  at a predetermined price 
in order to avoid the administrative efforts necessary to return leased tractors to the lessor  we typically purchase such tractors from the lessor by paying the residual value and then sell the tractors to the manufacturer 
there is no gain or loss on these transactions because the residual value we pay to the lessor is generally equal to the manufacturer s purchase price 
at december   the amount of our obligations to lessors for residual guarantees did not exceed the amount we expect to recover from the manufacturer 
as of december   our lease commitments for and beyond included million for rentals of tractors owned by our chairman and chief executive officer as well as our former executive vice president and chief operating officer 
for a discussion of such related party leases  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements at item and item of this form k 
depending upon the availability of qualified drivers and the level of customer demand for our services  we may add up to tractors to our company operated fleet during in addition  approximately of our oldest company operated tractors are expected to be replaced during these expenditures will be financed with internally generated funds  borrowings under available credit agreements and leasing 
we expect these sources of capital to be sufficient to finance our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet arrangements 
like many other trucking companies  we often utilize non cancelable operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
as of december   we leased  tractors and  trailers under operating leases with varying termination dates ranging from january to august vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments for such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item revenue equipment rent expense 
our rental expense related to operating leases involving vehicles during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
other we own a life insurance policy with a death benefit of million on the life of one of our founding shareholders 
the insured is years old 
the policy s cash surrender value of million as of december  is included in other assets on our balance sheet 
in the event that a benefit becomes payable under the policy  we would record as income the difference between the benefit and the cash surrender value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we held no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
for purposes other than trading  we held the following market risk sensitive instruments as of december  description discussion rabbi trust investment in  shares of our stock  million our consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities of a rabbi trust established to hold the investments of participants in our k wrap plan 
among such investments at december  were  shares of our common stock 
to the extent that the trust assets are invested in our stock  our future compensation expense and income will be impacted by fluctuations in the market price of our stock 
cash surrender value of life insurance policies  million the cash surrender value of our life insurance policies is a function of the amounts we pay to the insurance companies  the insurance charges taken by the insurance companies and the investment returns earned by or losses incurred by the insurance company 
changes in any of these factors will impact the cash surrender value of our life insurance policies 
insurance charges and investment performance have a direct effect on the value of our life insurance assets and on our net income 
we had no other material market risk sensitive instruments for trading or non trading purposes that would involve significant relevant market risks  such as equity price risk 
accordingly  the potential loss in our future earnings resulting from changes in such market rates or prices is not significant
