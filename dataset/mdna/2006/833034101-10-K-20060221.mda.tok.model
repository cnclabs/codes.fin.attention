michaels was elected chairman  president and chief executive officer of snap on  after having previously served as a member of snap on s board of directors since shortly thereafter  snap on announced near term priorities to improve operating efficiencies  respond to customer needs and market changes more quickly  address performance issues in its commercial and industrial businesses  and generally accelerate the pace of change towards achieving long term profitable growth 
during  measurable progress in each of these areas was realized 
significant improvement was made in first time fill rates an important element of manufacturing effectiveness and in tracking service to customers and franchisees 
as of year end  fill rates in the snap on dealer group improved 
prior year fill rates had been adversely impacted by the disruption caused from the closure of two us hand tool plants in initiatives to improve organizational alignment and working capital  reduce complexity and lower costs were launched early in these efforts  coupled with the introduction of rapid continuous improvement rci  resulted in a basis point increase in operating earnings margin for the year  largely from the improvement achieved in the commercial and industrial group and a increase in sales per associate year over year  despite the lower sales volume in operating earnings margin as a percent of revenue increased to in  as compared to in  despite a slight decline in total revenue from prior year levels 
additionally  rci is now becoming a part of the snap on culture and is helping ensure that progress continues towards further improving manufacturing efficiencies and reducing costs 
while this progress is encouraging  the company believes more must be done to improve snap on s operating performance 
our strategic priorities and plans for continue to build on the improvement initiatives already underway in the commercial and industrial and the diagnostics and information groups  while expanded efforts are being launched to strengthen the operating and financial performance of the snap on dealer group 
these priorities and plans are aimed at enabling us to continue the progress made in achieving our long term goals of profitably growing sales  further lowering costs  and maintaining strong cash flow 
significant progress has been made in improving the operating performance of the commercial and industrial group 
snap on rationalized brands and the group s operating footprint  moved toward lower cost sourcing and manufacturing  and created an integrated pan european marketing presence 
investments have also been made to support advanced technology products  such as snap on s next generation tire and wheel service equipment introduced in the last two years  and to establish an operating presence in emerging growth markets such as china  india and eastern europe 
as a result  snap on is seeing improved levels of customer service  market penetration and profitability 
while year over year segment revenue grew slightly from billion in to billion in  operating earnings grew to million from million in snap on s plans for the commercial and industrial group builds on this success and on the following strategic priorities continue to invest in emerging market growth initiatives  increase market share in industrial tools through continued improvements in fill rates and product innovation  and by reaching new customers  continue to invest in productivity enhancing products that utilize advanced technology  and continue to rationalize the group s operating footprint and move toward lower cost sourcing and manufacturing 
in the diagnostics and information group  significant accomplishments have been made during the past three years as a result of our strategic focus on creating an integrated instrumentation with information business 
two thirds of the group s engineering development is now concentrated on high value added data stream applications  complexity and structural costs were reduced and faster product development cycles achieved  and investments were made to support better business to business initiatives that include development and distribution of essential diagnostics and tools  and facilitation services for vehicle manufacturers and their dealership networks 
for  the diagnostics and information group s segment revenue declined to million from million in  reflecting the comparison against the successful global launch of new  snap on brand diagnostics products in the prior year  as well as the impact of lower original equipment manufacturer oem facilitation sales year over year 
notwithstanding the lower sales  operating margin improved to in as compared to in the prior year 
strategic priorities for the diagnostics and information group in will continue to emphasize process improvements and new products  such as the recent launch of the new mitchell customer service programs 
snap on also expects to leverage its market leading capabilities to capitalize on the growing need for products and services related to advanced diagnostics  vehicle interface and data stream communications 
in the snap on dealer group  total revenue declined to million in from billion in the prior year  largely due to a decrease in the average number of us franchise dealer vans in operation compared with the prior year 
despite the year over year revenue decline  operating earnings were million in compared with million in during  considerable effort was made in the snap on dealer group to evaluate and analyze marketplace data  the existing franchise business and its growth potential 
these efforts reaffirmed the growth opportunities available to snap on  as well as the competitive strengths of the company namely  the snap on brand  the company s mobile van tool distribution system  which is the preferred distribution system for the automotive service industry  and the substantial breadth and experience of snap on s franchisees 
to fully capitalize on these strengths  the snap on dealer group also concluded that more investment would enhance the company s responsiveness to its franchisees and customers  and identify better ways to assist franchisees in strengthening their businesses 
accordingly  snap on s strategic priorities to increase sales and profitability for the snap on dealer group are focused on the following continue on the company s existing path to improve and transform manufacturing and the supply chain into a market demand based replenishment system  with lower costs  continue to improve service and value to franchisees and customers  further enhance the sales and profitability of snap on s franchisees  and extend the group s brand and product lines into targeted niche markets that are currently underdeveloped 
specific initiatives in each of these areas are underway 
snap on believes that by executing on these focus areas  along with a continued commitment to new innovative products and rci to drive lower costs  the company and its franchisees will realize stronger growth and profitability 
in  snap on also continued its emphasis on improving cash flow

snap on is and has been engaged in the handling  manufacture  use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies 
the company believes that  as a general matter  its handling  manufacture  use and disposal of these substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations 
it is possible  however  that future knowledge or other developments  such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies  could bring into question the company s handling  manufacture  use or disposal of these substances

depending upon future developments and circumstances in these matters  snap on will continue to pursue all available strategies from dispositive class motions to settlement 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal matters due  in part  to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings  including the absence of precedents and clear procedures regarding class proceedings in arbitration 
new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are generally based on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
snap on considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
allowances for doubtful accounts snap on s accounts receivable are reported net of estimated bad debt allowances  which are regularly evaluated by management for adequacy 
the evaluations take into consideration various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay 
these factors may include customers financial condition  collateral  debt servicing capacity  past payment experience and credit bureau information 
snap on regularly reviews the allowance estimation process and adjusts the allowances as appropriate 
it is possible  however  that the accuracy of snap on s estimation process could be adversely impacted if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate 
the company does not believe that accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas 
inventory valuation snap on values its inventory at the lower of cost or market and adjusts for the value of inventory that is estimated to be excess  obsolete or otherwise unmarketable 
inventory adjustments for raw materials are largely based on analysis of raw material age and actual physical inspection of raw material for fitness for use 
as part of evaluating work in progress and finished goods  management reviews individual product stock keeping units skus by product category and product life cycle 
cost adjustments for each product category product life cycle state are generally established and maintained based on a combination of historical experience  forecasted sales and promotions  technological obsolescence  inventory age and other actual known conditions and circumstances 
should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from management estimates  further adjustments to inventory allowances may be required 
warranty accruals snap on provides product warranties for specific product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty costs in the period in which the sale is recorded 
snap on calculates its accrual requirements based on historic warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience  including the timing of claims during the warranty period and actual costs incurred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of snap on s warranty accrual 
pension benefits the calculation of snap on s pension expense and projected benefit obligation requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of snap on s control and can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in the financial statements 
snap on believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
for a discussion of the development of snap on s pension plans and expected return on plan assets assumption  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected rate of return assumption for snap on s domestic pension plan assets by would increase snap on s domestic pension expense by approximately million 
at year end  snap on s domestic plan assets comprised approximately of snap on s worldwide pension plan assets 
snap on establishes the discount rate using the current rates earned on long term bonds with a moody s aa rating 
pension expense and projected benefit obligation both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering snap on s domestic discount rate assumption by would increase snap on s domestic pension expense and projected benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively 
at year end  snap on s domestic projected benefit obligation comprised approximately of snap on s worldwide projected benefit obligation 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
outlook snap on expects to improve its current operating margin to or greater over the next three years  as it continues making progress towards a targeted long term goal of a mid teens operating margin 
snap on believes its end customer markets will grow at rates approximating gross domestic product gdp  and that the successful achievement of its plans and initiatives should improve the company s market share over time 
for  snap on expects  on a consolidated basis  continued improving performance in the commercial and industrial and the diagnostics and information groups to be offset by a higher level of spending in the snap on dealer group  particularly in the first two quarters of  as it implements certain initiatives to improve its franchise system  resulting in an expected decline in dealer segment operating earnings year over year in on a consolidated basis  this is expected to result in modestly lower year over year net earnings in the first two quarters of  snap on expects a recovery in its net earnings performance to occur in the second half of and to make steady progress into consolidated net sales in are expected to grow at a low single digit rate year over year  reflecting increased sales in all segments except the snap on dealer group  where sales are expected to remain flat for the full year 
in the commercial and industrial and the diagnostics and information business segments  snap on expects that the realization of its strategic priorities will result in increased operating earnings in over the level of tempering this growth in will be an expected million to million of higher operating spending to continue the company s expansion in asia and other emerging growth markets  and to support innovative new  information based diagnostics products 
in the snap on dealer segment  the company expects to incur approximately million of incremental costs in to increase field support and to support other franchise system initiatives 
an additional million to million of investment spending will be necessary in to support customer service and supply chain initiatives  and to support important new marketing programs to increase market share 
it is expected that the benefits of these programs will reduce inventories  increase the number of technicians being served and lower costs 
snap on also expects to realize million of annual cost savings in associated with ongoing initiatives to further improve its manufacturing facilities 
the company will invest an additional million to million of capital expenditures to upgrade us manufacturing plants 
additionally  as part of ongoing initiatives aimed at integrating the company s global operating footprint and lowering its cost structure  snap on expects to incur restructuring costs of approximately million in  consistent with levels 
in the financial services segment  snap on expects results to continue to be under pressure from rising interest rates  although not as significantly as in snap on also anticipates that the impact of adopting new stock option accounting rules  at current and anticipated grant levels  will reduce consolidated operating income in by approximately million to million 
as a result of retiring million of its debt in october  snap on expects lower interest expense for snap on believes its effective tax rate will approximate  compared with the incurred in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market  credit and economic risks market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
snap on is exposed to market risk from changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
snap on monitors its exposure to these risks and attempts to manage the underlying economic exposures through the use of financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
snap on does not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
snap on s broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 
snap on s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
foreign currency risk management snap on has significant international operations and is subject to certain risks inherent with foreign operations that include currency fluctuations and restrictions on movement of funds 
foreign exchange risk exists to the extent that snap on has payment obligations or receipts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
to manage these exposures  snap on identifies naturally offsetting positions and then generally purchases hedging instruments to protect the residual net anticipated exposures 
snap on s financial position and results of operations have not been materially affected by such events to date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of foreign currency risk management 
interest rate risk management snap on s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential earnings volatility that could arise from changes in interest rates 
through the use of interest rate swaps  snap on aims to stabilize funding costs by managing the exposure created by the differing maturities and interest rate structures of snap on s assets and liabilities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of interest rate risk management 
snap on utilizes a value at risk var model to determine the potential one day loss in the fair value of its interest rate and foreign exchange sensitive financial instruments from adverse changes in market factors 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a confidence level 
snap on s computations are based on the inter relationships among movements in various currencies and interest rates variance co variance technique 
these inter relationships were determined by observing interest rate and foreign currency market changes over the preceding quarter 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model  at december   was million on interest rate sensitive financial instruments and million on foreign currency sensitive financial instruments 
the var model is a risk management tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by snap on  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms 
prior to granting credit  each customer is evaluated  taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition  collateral  debt servicing capacity  past payment experience  credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation 
loans that have been granted are typically monitored through an asset quality review process that closely monitors past due accounts and initiates collection actions when appropriate 
in addition to its direct credit risk exposure  snap on also has credit risk exposure for certain soc loan originations with recourse provisions against snap on primarily for dealer van loans 
at december   million of loans originated by soc have a recourse provision to snap on if the loans become more than days past due 
for additional information on soc  refer to the section entitled consolidated joint venture in this management s discussion and analysis and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel and energy sources such as natural gas and electricity 
the company is also a purchaser of components and parts that are integrated into the company s end products  as well as the purchaser of certain finished goods  all of which may contain various commodities including steel  aluminum and others 
snap on s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers 
snap on experienced higher pricing related to certain grades and alloys of steel in and due to global demand for these materials 
the company generally buys these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not anticipate experiencing any significant pricing or availability issues with regards to raw material steel purchases 
several of the company s distribution channels  particularly the mobile dealer van channel  can be significantly impacted by increases in gasoline and fuel prices 
as these costs rise  dealers may limit their driving  resulting in fewer customer calls and generally lower product sales 
snap on also experienced higher fuel surcharges on material and product shipments in as a result of the increase in gasoline and fuel prices 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing agreements with its suppliers  the company may experience margin declines to the extent that it is not able to increase the selling prices of its products
