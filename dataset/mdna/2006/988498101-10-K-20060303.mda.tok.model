item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview yum brands  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to as yum or the company comprises the worldwide operations of kfc  pizza hut  taco bell  long john silver s ljs and a w all american food restaurants a w collectively the concepts and is the world s largest quick service restaurant qsr company based on the number of system units 
ljs and a w were added when yum acquired yorkshire global restaurants  inc ygr on may  yum is the second largest qsr company outside the us with over  units 
yum became an independent  publicly owned company on october  the spin off date via a tax free distribution of our common stock the distribution or spin off to the shareholders of our former parent  pepsico  inc pepsico 
through its concepts  yum develops  operates  franchises and licenses a system of both traditional and non traditional qsr restaurants 
traditional units feature dine in  carryout and  in some instances  drive thru or delivery services 
non traditional units  which are typically licensed outlets  include express units and kiosks which have a more limited menu and operate in non traditional locations like malls  airports  gasoline service stations  convenience stores  stadiums  amusement parks and colleges  where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 
the retail food industry  in which the company competes  is made up of supermarkets  supercenters  warehouse stores  convenience stores  coffee shops  snack bars  delicatessens and restaurants including the qsr segment  and is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price  service  convenience  location and concept 
the industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional or local economic conditions  currency fluctuations  demographic trends  traffic patterns  the type  number and location of competing food retailers and products  and disposable purchasing power 
each of the concepts compete with international  national and regional restaurant chains as well as locally owned restaurants  not only for customers  but also for management and hourly personnel  suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 
our business consists of three reporting segments united states  the international division and the china division 
the china division includes mainland china china  thailand and kfc taiwan and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations 
the company s key strategies are building dominant restaurant brands in china driving profitable international expansion improving restaurant operations multibranding category leading brands the company is focused on five long term measures identified as essential to our growth and progress 
these five measures and related key performance indicators are as follows china division and international division expansion china division and international division system sales growth local currency number of new china division and international division restaurant openings net china division and international division unit growth multibrand innovation and expansion number of multibrand restaurant locations number of multibrand units added number of franchise multibrand units added portfolio of category leading us brands us blended same store sales growth us system sales growth global franchise fees new restaurant openings by franchisees franchise fee growth strong cash generation and returns cash generated from all sources cash generated from all sources after capital spending restaurant margins our progress against these measures is discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis md a 
throughout the md a  the company provides the percentage change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
these amounts are derived by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates 
we believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year to year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations 
this md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements on pages through and the cautionary statements on page all note references herein refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements on pages through tabular amounts are displayed in millions except per share and unit count amounts  or as otherwise specifically identified 
factors affecting comparability of results to results and results to results international reporting changes in  we began reporting information for our international business in two separate operating segments as a result of changes to our management reporting structure 
the china division includes mainland china china  thailand and kfc taiwan  and the international division includes the remainder of our international operations 
while this reporting change did not impact our consolidated results  segment information for previous periods has been restated to be consistent with the current period presentation 
beginning in  we also changed the china business reporting calendar to more closely align the timing of the reporting of its results of operations with our us business 
previously our china business  like the rest of our international businesses  closed one month or one period for certain of our international businesses earlier than yum s period end date to facilitate consolidated reporting 
to maintain comparability of our consolidated results of operations  amounts related to our china business for december have not been reflected in our consolidated statements of income and net income of the china business of million for the one month period ending december  was recognized as an adjustment directly to consolidated retained earnings in the year to date ended december  our consolidated results of operations for the year to date ended december  include the results of operations of the china business for the months of january  through december  our consolidated results of operations for the years to date ended december  and december  continue to include the results of operations of the china business for the months december  through november  and december  through november   respectively  as previously reported 
adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment in the fourth quarter  the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas  supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas r are similar to those of sfas  however  sfas r requires all new  modified and unvested share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost over the service period based on their fair value on the date of grant 
compensation cost is recognized over the service period on a straight line basis for the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we adopted sfas r using the modified retrospective application transition method effective september   the beginning of our fourth quarter 
as permitted by sfas r  we applied the modified retrospective application transition method to the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption our fiscal year 
as such  the first three fiscal quarters of are required to be adjusted to recognize the compensation cost previously reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures under the provisions of sfas however  years prior to have not been restated 
the adoption of sfas r in resulted in the reduction of operating profit of million million in payroll and employee benefits and million in general and administrative expense  a reduction of net income of million net of tax benefits of million  a reduction of both basic and diluted earnings per share of per share  a reduction of million in cash flows from operating activities and an increase of million in cash flows from financing activities 
the following table shows the quarterly after tax effect of adoption of sfas r on the previously reported first three quarters of first quarter second quarter third quarter net income diluted eps net income diluted eps net income diluted eps reported results prior to sfas r adoption impact of sfas r adoption results subsequent to sfas r adoption we also have included the following tables detailing the additional expense by quarter  by segment and by financial statement line item of the impact of adoption of sfas r as well as the related decrease in operating profit  income tax benefit and decrease in net income 
the numbers as presented have been rounded to accommodate our financial statement presentation conventions 
however  unrounded expense by segment is relatively consistent throughout all quarters relative to actual number of days in the quarter 
quarter ended march  us international china unallocated total payroll and employee benefits general and administrative operating profit income tax benefit net income impact quarter ended june  us international china unallocated total payroll and employee benefits general and administrative operating profit income tax benefit net income impact quarter ended september  us international china unallocated total payroll and employee benefits general and administrative operating profit income tax benefit net income impact quarter ended december  us international china unallocated total payroll and employee benefits general and administrative operating profit income tax benefit net income impact year ended december  us international china unallocated total payroll and employee benefits general and administrative operating profit income tax benefit net income impact prior to  all stock options granted were accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb and its related interpretations 
accordingly  no stock based employee compensation expense was reflected in the consolidated statements of income for stock options  as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
had the company applied the fair value provisions of sfas to stock options in and  net income of million and million  respectively  would have been reduced by million and million  respectively  to million and million  respectively 
additionally  both basic and diluted earnings per common share would have decreased per share for both and extra week in our fiscal calendar results in a rd week every five or six years 
fiscal year includes a rd week in the fourth quarter for the majority of our us businesses as well as our international businesses that report on a period  as opposed to a monthly  basis 
in the us  we permanently accelerated the timing of the kfc business closing by one week in december  and thus  there was no rd week benefit for this business 
additionally  all china division businesses report on a monthly basis and thus did not have a rd week 
the following table summarizes the estimated increase decrease of the rd week on revenues and operating profit us international division unallocated total revenues company sales franchise and license fees total revenues operating profit franchise and license fees restaurant profit general and administrative expenses equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates operating profit mainland china issues our kfc business in mainland china was negatively impacted by the interruption of product offerings and negative publicity associated with a supplier ingredient issue experienced in late march  as well as consumer concerns related to avian flu in the fourth quarter of as a result of the aforementioned issues  the china division experienced system sales growth in of excluding foreign currency translation which is below our ongoing target of at least 
during the year to date ended december   we entered into an agreement for a partial recovery of our losses related to the supplier ingredient issue with the supplier 
as a result of the agreement  we recognized approximately million in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  sale of an investment in unconsolidated affiliate during the second quarter of  we sold our fifty percent interest in the entity that operated almost all kfcs and pizza huts in poland and the czech republic to our then partner in the entity  principally for cash 
concurrent with the sale  our former partner completed an initial public offering ipo of the majority of the stock it then owned in the entity 
prior to the sale  we accounted for our investment in this entity using the equity method 
subsequent to the ipo  the new publicly held entity  in which yum has no ownership interest  is a franchisee as was the entity in which we previously held a fifty percent interest 
this transaction generated a one time gain of approximately million for yum as cash proceeds net of expenses of approximately million from the sale of our interest in the entity exceeded our recorded investment in this unconsolidated affiliate 
as with our equity income from investments in unconsolidated affiliates  the approximate million gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statements of income 
the sale did not have a significant impact on our subsequently reported results of operations in nor is it expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations going forward 
hurricane katrina during the third quarter of  hurricane katrina caused significant damage to several company and franchised stores 
this storm resulted in approximately million of one time costs being recorded in the full year from property damage and asset write offs related to company restaurants 
additionally  during mid september  hurricane rita caused further damage to company and franchised stores  though to a lesser extent than hurricane katrina 
we estimate that lost operating profits in as a result of stores being closed due to the effects of these hurricanes was approximately million 
we do not expect insurance recoveries  if any  related to the hurricanes to be significant 
in the fourth quarter  we experienced utility costs in the us that were approximately million higher than in the prior year  which we believe were at least partially attributable to these hurricanes 
we expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of with year over year utility inflation of approximately percent or approximately million 
sale of puerto rico business our puerto rico business was held for sale beginning the fourth quarter of and was sold on october  for an amount approximating its then carrying value 
company sales and restaurant profit decreased million and million  respectively  franchise fees increased million and general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  company sales and restaurant profit decreased million and million  respectively  franchise fees increased million and general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  income tax impact of repatriating qualified foreign earnings the american jobs creation act of the act  which became law on october   allows a dividends received deduction of of repatriated qualified foreign earnings in fiscal year we recorded million in income tax expense during the year ended december  as a result of our then determination to repatriate approximately million in which will be eligible for the act s dividends received deduction 
in accordance with fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of  we continued to evaluate in whether we would repatriate other undistributed earnings from foreign investments as a result of the act 
during the second quarter of  we determined that we would repatriate additional qualified foreign earnings of approximately million in fiscal year which will be eligible for the act s dividends received deduction for a total repatriation of qualified earnings of approximately million 
as a result of this determination  approximately million of additional tax expense was recognized in fiscal no additional amounts beyond the approximately million as discussed above are eligible for the act s dividends received deduction 
lease accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an adjustment to correct instances where our leasehold improvements were not being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the term of the lease  including options in some instances  over which we were recording rent expense  including escalations  on a straight line basis 
the cumulative adjustment  primarily through increased us depreciation expense  totaled million million after tax 
the portion of this adjustment that related to was approximately million 
as the portion of our adjustment recorded that was a correction of errors of amounts reported in our prior period financial statements was not material to any of those prior period financial statements  the entire adjustment was recorded in the consolidated financial statements and no adjustment was made to any prior period financial statements 
amendment of sale leaseback agreements on august  we amended two sale leaseback agreements assumed in our acquisition of ygr such that the agreements now qualify for sale leaseback accounting 
restaurant profit decreased by million in versus as a result of the two amended agreements being accounted for as operating leases subsequent to the amendment 
the decrease in restaurant profit was largely offset by a similar decrease in interest expense 
canada unconsolidated affiliate dissolution on november   we dissolved our unconsolidated affiliate that previously operated restaurants in canada 
we owned of this unconsolidated affiliate prior to its dissolution and accounted for our interest under the equity method 
of the restaurants previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate  we now operate the vast majority of pizza huts and taco bells  while almost all kfcs are operated by franchisees 
as a result of operating certain restaurants that were previously operated by the unconsolidated affiliate  our company sales  restaurant profit and general and administrative expenses increased and our franchise fees decreased in versus additionally  on a full year basis other income increased as we recorded a loss from our investment in the canadian unconsolidated affiliate in as a result of the dissolution of our canadian unconsolidated affiliate  company sales increased million  franchise fees decreased million  restaurant profit increased million  general and administrative expenses increased million and other income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the impact on net income was not significant 
commodity inflation higher commodity costs  particularly in cheese and meat prices  negatively impacted us restaurant margins as a percentage of sales by approximately basis points for the year ended versus the year ended wrench litigation we recorded income of million and million in and  respectively  and expense of million in see note for a discussion of the wrench litigation 
ameriserve and other charges credits we recorded income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see note for a detailed discussion of ameriserve and other charges credits 
store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where their expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of key us and international markets 
such refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
the following table summarizes our refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pre tax refranchising net gains  pre tax in addition to our refranchising program  from time to time we close restaurants that are poor performing  we relocate restaurants to a new site within the same trade area or we consolidate two or more of our existing units into a single unit collectively store closures 
store closure costs income includes the net of gains or losses on sales of real estate on which we are not currently operating a company restaurant  lease reserves established when we cease using a property under an operating lease and subsequent adjustments to those reserves  and other facility related expenses from previously closed stores

liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our franchise operations  which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last four fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
these cash flows have allowed us to fund our discretionary spending  while at the same time reducing our long term debt balances 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
though a decline in revenues could adversely impact our cash flows from operations  we believe our operating cash flows  our ability to reduce discretionary spending  and our borrowing capacity will allow us to meet our cash requirements in and beyond 
during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  on an annual basis  the company is targeting an annual payout ratio of to of net income 
our primary bank credit agreement comprises a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in september the credit facility is unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries and contains financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  level of cash dividends  aggregate non us investment and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december  under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or to over an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
additionally  on november   we executed a five year revolving credit facility the international credit facility or icf on behalf of three of our wholly owned international subsidiaries 
the total facility amount is million  with separate sublimits for each of the three subsidiaries 
the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum and by yum s principal domestic subsidiaries and contains covenants substantially identical to those of the credit facility 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december there were borrowings of million and available credit of million outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or to over a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
the remainder of our long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  included in short term borrowings at december  are million in senior unsecured notes with an april maturity date 
the remaining billion in senior unsecured notes comprise the majority of our long term debt 
we estimate that in capital spending  including acquisitions of our restaurants from franchisees  will be approximately million 
we also estimate that in refranchising proceeds  prior to taxes  will be approximately million  employee stock options proceeds  prior to taxes  will be approximately million and sales of property  plant and equipment will be approximately million 
in november  the board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of the company s outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees to be purchased through november at december   we had remaining capacity to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock excluding applicable transaction fees under the november program 
in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet under gaap total contractual obligations a excludes a fair value adjustment of million deducted from debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to approximately  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plan s funded status 
the pension plan s funded status is affected by many factors including discount rates and the performance of plan assets 
based on current funding rules  we are not required to make minimum pension funding payments in  but we may make discretionary contributions during the year based on our estimate of the plan s expected september  funded status 
during  we made a million discretionary contribution to our funded plan  none of which represented minimum funding requirements 
our postretirement plan is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made postretirement benefit payments of million in also excluded from the contractual obligations table are payments we may make for workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses as well as employee healthcare and long term disability claims for which we are self insured 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee health  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we had provided approximately million of partial guarantees of two franchisee loan pools related primarily to the company s historical refranchising programs and  to a lesser extent  franchisee development of new restaurants at december  in support of these guarantees  we posted letters of credit of million 
we also provided a standby letter of credit of million  under which we could potentially be required to fund a portion of one of the franchisee loan pools 
the total loans outstanding under these loan pools were approximately million at december  any funding under the guarantees or letters of credit would be secured by the franchisee loans and any related collateral 
we believe that we have appropriately provided for our estimated probable exposures under these contingent liabilities 
these provisions were primarily charged to net refranchising loss gain 
new loans added to the loan pools in were not significant 
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
restaurants held and used are evaluated for impairment on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant or an offer to refranchise a restaurant or group of restaurants for less than the carrying value 
our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the restaurant  which can be for a period of over years  and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate used is our cost of capital  adjusted upward when a higher risk is believed to exist 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and  therefore  perform such impairment evaluations at the group level 
forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds less applicable transaction costs 
expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates we record impairment charges related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate whenever events or circumstances indicate that a decrease in the value of an investment has occurred which is other than temporary 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment when they have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our impairment measurement test for an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is similar to our semi annual test for impairment of our restaurants except that we use discounted cash flows after interest and taxes instead of discounted cash flows before interest and taxes as used for our restaurants 
the fair values of our investments in each of our unconsolidated affiliates are currently significantly in excess of their carrying values 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated by discounting expected future cash flows from the reporting unit over twenty years plus an expected terminal value 
we have recorded intangible assets as a result of business acquisitions 
these include trademark brand intangible assets for kfc  ljs and a w 
we believe the value of a trademark brand is derived from the royalty we avoid  in the case of company stores  or receive  in the case of franchise stores  due to our ownership of the trademark brand 
we have determined that the kfc trademark brand has an indefinite life and therefore it is not being amortized 
our impairment test for the kfc trademark brand consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
anticipated sales are the most important assumption in determining the fair value of the kfc trademark brand 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units and the kfc trademark brand  we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth  margin and other factors impacting the fair value calculation to those that are supportable based upon our plans 
for  there was no impairment of goodwill or the kfc trademark brand 
we have certain intangible assets  such as the ljs and a w trademark brand intangible assets  franchise contract rights and favorable operating leases  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
we base the expected useful lives of our favorable operating leases on the remaining lease term 
our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the amortizable intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
allowances for franchise and license receivables lease guarantees we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 
such guarantees are subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
if payment on the guarantee ever becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans was amended in such that employees hired after september  are not eligible to participate 
as of our september  measurement date  these plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of million  an accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and a fair value of plan assets of million 
as a result of the million underfunded status of the plans relative to the abo at september  and an additional million contribution to the plans made subsequent to the measurement date but prior to december   we have recorded a cumulative million charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax of million as of december  the pbo and abo reflect the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees 
the pbo incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels while the abo reflects only current compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo and abo are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
we measured our pbo and abo using a discount rate of at september  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more high quality corporate debt instruments with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately million at september  conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately million at september  the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at september  in total  we expect pension expense to increase approximately million to million in the increase is primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial loss of million in a basis point change in our discount rate assumption of at september  would impact our pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rate of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return was lowered to from in connection with our september  valuation 
we believe this revision was appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon  including those experienced in calendar year this change did not impact our reported pension expense for but will increase our expense by approximately million 
the losses our plan assets have experienced  along with the decrease in discount rates  have largely contributed to an unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our plans as of september  for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of unrecognized actuarial loss 
we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial loss in given no change to the assumptions at our september  measurement date  actuarial loss recognition will remain at an amount near that to be recognized in over the next few years before it begins to gradually decline 
see note for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans 
income tax valuation allowances and tax reserves at december   we have a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of million and our other deferred tax assets to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in many state and foreign jurisdictions and have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage 
the estimation of future taxable income in these state and foreign jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
stock option expense compensation expense for stock options is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  under sfas r we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we determined that it was appropriate to group our stock option grants into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected life and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock option plans 
historically  approximately of total options granted have been made under the rgm plan 
we have traditionally used six years as the expected term of all stock option grants 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r and the increasing amount of historical data we now possess with regard to stock option exercise activity  we revaluated our expected term assumptions 
based on historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior  we determined that the expected life for options granted under the rgm plan was five years 
for options granted to our above store executives  we determined that an expected life of six years was appropriate 
prior to the adoption of sfas r we have traditionally based expected volatility on company specific historical stock data over the expected term of the option 
we are in the process of revaluating expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas r in the fourth quarter of were not significant 
prior to our adoption of sfas r we recorded reductions in expense due to pre vesting forfeitures as they occurred 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all options granted under the rgm plan  which typically vest on a cliff basis after four years  will be forfeited while approximately of options granted to above store executives  which typically vest per year over four years  will be forfeited 
an insignificant transition adjustment was recorded upon the adoption of sfas r for the difference between actual and estimated forfeitures for the first three quarters of which we restated under the modified retrospective transition method 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the united states 
we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of debt 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  the americas and europe 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is eliminated 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements as well as  on a limited basis  commodity future and option contracts 
commodity future and option contracts entered into for the fiscal years ended december   and december   did not significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cautionary statements from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements  we present forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the statements include those identified by such words as may  will  expect  project  anticipate  believe  plan and other similar terminology 
these forward looking statements reflect our current expectations regarding future events and operating and financial performance and are based upon data available at the time of the statements 
actual results involve risks and uncertainties  including both those specific to the company and those specific to the industry  and could differ materially from expectations 
accordingly  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
company risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  changes in effective tax rates  potential unfavorable variances between estimated and actual liabilities  our ability to secure distribution of products and equipment to our restaurants on favorable economic terms and our ability to ensure adequate supply of restaurant products and equipment in our stores  unexpected disruptions in our supply chain  effects and outcomes of any pending or future legal claims involving the company  the effectiveness of operating initiatives and marketing and advertising and promotional efforts  our ability to continue to recruit and motivate qualified restaurant personnel  the ongoing financial viability of our franchisees and licensees  the success of our refranchising strategy  the success of our strategies for international development and operations  volatility of actuarially determined losses and loss estimates  and adoption of new or changes in accounting policies and practices including pronouncements promulgated by standard setting bodies 
industry risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  economic and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate  including effects of war and terrorist activities  new legislation and governmental regulations or changes in laws and regulations and the consequent impact on our business  new product and concept development by us and or our food industry competitors  changes in commodity  labor  and other operating costs  changes in competition in the food industry  publicity which may impact our business and or industry  severe weather conditions  volatility of commodity costs  increases in minimum wage and other operating costs  availability and cost of land and construction  consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the products of the company and or our competitors  spending patterns and demographic trends  political or economic instability in local markets and changes in currency exchange and interest rates  and the impact that any widespread illness or general health concern may have on our business and or the economy of the countries in which we operate
