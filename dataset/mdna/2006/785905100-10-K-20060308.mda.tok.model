business trends the following trends represent what management believes are the most significant challenges and opportunities that are currently impacting our business and industry 
the discussion also includes management s best assessment of what effects these trends are having on our business 
potential effects of the following trends are discussed in item a risk factors 
transaction volumes 
for the year ended december   sabre travel network experienced transaction growth of compared to the year ended due primarily to an increase in non traditional transactions 
see item business sabre travel network changing our sabre travel network revenue model 
sabre travel network has performed well in an industry faced with economic downturn  travel security concerns  channel shift and continued pressures on the gds booking fee 
sabre travel network annual transactions and transaction revenue have remained relatively stable since with a compounded decrease in annual transactions processed through the sabre system 
sabre travel network has been able to achieve this in part due to long term content agreement with key suppliers in exchange for discounted booking fees 
we believe that this has contributed in reducing the rate at which transactions leave the gds channel for supplier controlled channels  including individual airline websites and call centers  and other third party controlled distribution points 
for the three years ended december   travelocity has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues due to our continued growth in north america and expansion into the european market with the acquisitions of lastminute 
com and travelocity europe which contributed to the growth in bookings made through our websites and contact centers  and increased yields and transaction volumes stimulated by increased net rate activity and improved packaging of offerings 
although travelocity was negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above and by declining internet advertising revenue  the growth in the internet travel business combined with the travelocity net rate model and packaging initiatives and market expansion into europe offset the negative impacts 
sabre airline solutions has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues for the three years ended december  although sabre airline solutions and its customers were negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above  we were able to grow revenues in each of the past two years 
this increase in revenues is the result of increased sales of decision support products and services  consulting and web enabled solutions that offer cost savings and more efficient operations to our customers 
additionally  this increase was driven by growth in airline reservation hosting revenues 
supplier efforts to control travel distribution 
airlines have been working aggressively for several years to divert transactions away from gds networks and towards alternative travel distribution channels  including websites that they control and online travel agencies that book directly with those airlines 
see item a risk factors travel suppliers are pursuing distribution options the efforts of suppliers to divert transactions away from independent distributors such as online and conventional travel agencies using our sabre gds towards supplier direct channels such as supplier controlled websites and call centers are referred to as channel shift 
over the last several years we have experienced channel shift in air transactions at an annualized rate of approximately two percentage points 
alternative distribution systems 
travelers are being offered many systems that enable travel shopping  booking and purchasing 
established and start up search engine companies are attempting to enter the travel marketplace by aggregating travel search results across supplier  travel agent and other websites 
many alternative distribution systems offer lower costs to suppliers  but they are not global and offer travelers a limited subset of transactions from a limited subset of suppliers in one market segment 
the systems often must rely on the scale and functionality of a gds such as our sabre system for a complete travel distribution solution for suppliers and travel agencies 
they do not offer comprehensive functionality and do not have the infrastructure to adequately service and support travel management companies or corporations 
they require the integration of a new  stand alone system into most existing agency or corporate booking tool workflows 
many of these alternative travel distribution channels  including limited travel distributors or ltds  are well financed but are in start up or developing mode  and have yet to fully define their functionality and costs 
these alternative travel distribution systems may have the effect of diverting customers from our online sites and our sabre gds  putting pressure on our revenues  pricing and operating margins 
see item a risk factors travel suppliers are pursuing distribution options additional business trends 
for a discussion of additional business trends  please refer to the following sections of item business the sabre global distribution system travel supplier participation and pricing options sabre travel network changing our sabre travel network revenue model travelocity investments in travelocity travelocity net rate program cost reductions and expense savings 
as part of our cost leadership strategy  we are  as a standard practice  evaluating efficiency opportunities across the company to ensure that we optimally manage our operational costs 
some of these cost saving opportunities have involved and may continue to involve globally sourcing some of our operations either by contracting with companies that work for us  such as through the opening of call centers we operate abroad  or by expanding our own operations abroad 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of various costs saving initiatives 
we are also developing programs to reduce the growth rate of incentive payments to travel agencies

revenues 
the compounded annual growth rate of revenues by segment for the three years ended december  was a reduction of for sabre travel network  and growth of for travelocity and for sabre airline solutions 
each of our business segments have benefited from generally good economic conditions  stronger demand for travel products and acquisitions 
however  each of our business segments have been negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors during this period including the war and continued conflict in iraq  ongoing travel security concerns  and fear of potential terrorist attacks and infectious diseases such as sars 
these negative impacts to the general economy and the travel industry impacted each of our business segments 
sabre travel network has performed well in an industry faced with economic downturn  travel security concerns  channel shift and continued pressures on the gds booking fee 
sabre travel network annual transactions and transaction revenue have remained relatively stable since with a compounded decrease in annual transactions processed through the sabre system 
sabre travel network has been able to achieve this in part due to long term content agreements with key suppliers in exchange for discounted booking fees 
we believe that this has contributed in reducing the rate at which transactions leave the gds channel for supplier controlled channels  including individual airline websites and call centers  and other third party controlled distribution points 
for the three years ended december   travelocity has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues due to our continued growth in north america and expansion into the european market with the acquisitions of lastminute 
com and travelocity europe which contributed to the growth in bookings made through our websites and contact centers  and increased yields and transaction volumes stimulated by increased net rate activity and improved packaging of offerings 
although travelocity was negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above and by declining internet advertising revenue  the growth in the internet travel business combined with the travelocity net rate model and packaging initiatives and market expansion into europe offset the negative impacts 
sabre airline solutions has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues for the three years ended december  although sabre airline solutions and its customers were negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above  we were able to grow revenues in each of the past several years 
this increase in revenues is the result of increased sales of decision support products and services  consulting and web enabled solutions that offer cost savings and more efficient operations to our customers 
additionally  this increase was driven by growth in airline reservation hosting revenues 
expenses 
our primary operating expenses consist of salaries  benefits  other employee related costs  data processing costs  communication costs  advertising and subscriber incentives  representing approximately  and of total operating expenses in  and  respectively 
we have seen a decline in our expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives across our organization 
however  since  we have realized a compounded increase in our operating expenses of approximately due primarily to the acquisition of lastminute 
com in july of sabre travel network hardware and communications costs have decreased as a result of the migration to lower cost solutions and the adoption of third party solutions by subscribers 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in sabre travel network technology spending due to the phased implementation and continuing expansion of new functionality that requires running legacy systems as well as the new technology  and increases in sabre travel network subscriber incentives 
other increases in expenses have resulted from investments in various new businesses such as our synxis hotel reservations system 
travelocity cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses have increased due to growth in the business 
significant acquisitions during this period  including lastminute 
com in and travelocity europe in  have contributed to the growth in expenses 
we increased our expenditures for advertising in order to drive additional travelers to travelocity s websites  and expenses have increased as a result of increases in transaction volumes for our growing net rate offerings 
our technology infrastructure related expenses have also increased in order to support our growth and new offerings 
sabre airline solutions operating expenses have generally grown at a rate commensurate with the growth in revenues during the to period

we may also use our funds  as well as external sources of funds  to retire debt as appropriate  based upon market conditions and our desired liquidity and capital structure 
risk factors that could possibly affect the availability of our internally generated funds include  among other things margin pressure from increased subscriber incentives in our sabre travel network business  changes in our sabre travel network business model  including new pricing options offered to travel suppliers upon expiration of the dca year option agreements  diversion of transactions away from our distribution offerings and other competitive pressures  and increased spending to fund growth in travelocity and the integration of lastminute

financing arrangements bridge financing arrangement on may   we entered into an million  unsecured bridge loan agreement the bridge facility that matures on august   in order to provide short term financing in connection with the lastminute 
com acquisition and to satisfy legal requirements for certainty of funding for the acquisition 
on july   we entered into an amendment to the bridge facility whereby all the rights and obligations of sabre inc under the bridge facility were assumed by sabre holdings and sabre inc was discharged from its obligations thereunder 
effective august   we borrowed million under the bridge facility in order to fund a portion of the lastminute 
com acquisition 
the interest rate on borrowings under the bridge facility is variable  based at our discretion on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus a borrowing spread or the prime rate  and is sensitive to our credit rating 
the libor spread at our current credit rating is  which at december  equated to a borrowing rate of 
we may prepay all or any part of the bridge facility without prepayment penalties  other than any breakage costs associated with the early repayment of loans bearing interest based upon libor 
we would be required to repay borrowings under the bridge facility with net cash proceeds we receive from i the issuance of capital stock and indebtedness for money borrowed with a maturity in excess of one year excluding  among other things  borrowings under our existing revolving credit agreement and ii asset sales with proceeds of more than million 
the bridge facility contains other covenants  representations  terms and conditions that are typical for a bridge credit facility of this type which  among other things  restricts our ability to incur additional debt and limits our ability to pay in excess of million during the term of the bridge facility as dividends or as repurchases of our stock 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the bridge facility including the following financial covenants covenant requirement level at december  consolidated leverage ratio debt to ebitda to to consolidated net worth billion billion on february   we prepaid million of the million acquisition bridge facility from our available cash and marketable securities 
we will be required to repay or refinance the remaining million of the bridge facility prior to its expiration on august  we are evaluating choices for repaying and refinancing the bridge facility  including using additional cash  borrowing under our revolving credit agreement and accessing public and private markets for debt 
the timing and choice of refinancing options will be subject to market conditions  but we expect to repay or refinance the bridge facility during the first half of revolving credit agreement on july   in order to facilitate the consummation of the lastminute 
com acquisition and to provide additional liquidity and flexibility in our capital structure  we entered into certain amendments to our current revolving credit agreement credit facility 
under the amendments  sabre holdings assumed all of the rights and obligations of sabre inc under the credit facility and sabre inc 
was discharged from its obligations thereunder 
the amendments also include  among other things i amendments to certain financial and negative covenants including amendments to provide us more flexibility under the consolidated leverage ratio covenant  as shown in the table below  and amendments that place additional restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness  ii amendments that prohibit us from using proceeds from the credit facility to repay the bridge facility to the extent such proceeds represent more than of the then aggregate committed amount of the lenders under the credit facility  iii amendments that increase the aggregate amount committed by those lenders to million  and iv amendments that allow us to request a future increase of the aggregate amount committed by the lenders under the credit facility to as much as million 
as of december   there are no borrowings outstanding under this agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this agreement including the following financial covenants covenant requirement level at december  consolidated leverage ratio debt to ebitda to maximum to consolidated net worth billion billion our covenants under the amended revolving credit agreement are as follows as amended on july  requirement consolidated leverage ratio debt to ebitda for the quarters ended july  through march  to maximum june  through september  to maximum december  through march  to maximum june  and thereafter to maximum public notes in august  we issued through sabre holdings corporation million in senior unsecured notes notes  bearing interest at and maturing august   in an underwritten public offering resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately million 
the notes include certain non financial covenants  including restrictions on incurring certain types of debt or entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements under the notes 
in conjunction with these notes  we have entered into two interest rate swaps through for a total of million  which pay us and on which we pay a variable rate based on a six month libor plus basis points 
capital lease obligation in june  sabre inc entered into a ten year master lease for our corporate headquarters facility in southlake  texas  which is accounted for as a capital lease 
the interest rate on the capital lease financing is fixed at 
at the inception of the lease  we recorded an asset of approximately million  along with a liability of approximately million  representing the present value of the minimum lease payments due under the lease and the residual value guarantee discussed below 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to terminate the lease and purchase the properties for approximately million  plus a make whole amount  if applicable 
we also have the option at any time up to one year prior to lease expiration to cause the properties to be sold 
if this sell option is exercised  we have guaranteed that proceeds on a sale will be at least approximately million  and we are responsible for the first dollar loss up to approximately million due to a decrease in the value of the property below approximately million 
if the sales proceeds exceed approximately million plus any sales related expenses  we retain the excess 
in conjunction with this lease  we have entered into a million interest rate swap which pays us and on which we pay a variable rate based on a six month libor plus basis points 
under the lease agreement  we are subject to certain covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this agreement including the following financial covenant covenant requirement level at december  consolidated net worth billion billion cash flows in thousands year ended december  cash provided by operating activities    cash used for investing activities    cash provided by used for financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  total cash increase    operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million which resulted from net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items of million 
this was offset by unfavorable changes in our working capital of million 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million in the year ended december  compared to the same period a year ago 
this decrease was primarily driven by a million reduction in our net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
another factor that contributed significantly to the reduction in cash flow from operating activities was the timing of the acquisition of lastminute 
com in the third quarter of which  along with the fourth quarter is historically the slowest from a cash generation perspective 
lastminute 
com generates most of its positive cash flows during the first part of the year  from which we were unable to benefit in therefore  we expect that this trend will be reversed in the first half of  but this trend is seasonal with the booking of travel and will fluctuate accordingly 
other factors contributing to the reduced cash flow from operating activities include collection of a million receivable in related to the cancellation of two subscriber contracts and higher payouts of variable compensation due to positive financial results 
other changes are primarily due to timing differences 
cash provided by operating activities during year ended december  was million  which was primarily from net earnings of million adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities includes favorable changes in working capital of million 
cash flows from operations increased million in the year ended december  from the same period a year ago 
this increase was primarily driven by an increase of million in our net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
in we also received million related to the cancellation of two subscriber contracts 
in addition  expedited collections in our merchant model due to changing service providers provided approximately million in additional cash 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million and was primarily from net earnings of million including non cash and non operating items as well as favorable changes in working capital items 
non cash and non operating adjustments to net earnings of million for the year ended december  included depreciation and amortization of million  a million impairment of an intangible asset related to our agreement with a former hotel supplier  million in losses from asset disposals  a million charge relating to the termination of our syndicated lease facility  and stock compensation expense of million  offset by deferred taxes of million 
investing activities the million increase in cash used for investing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the year ago period primarily results from a  million increase in acquisitions net of cash acquired which results primarily from our acquisition of lastminute 
com 
additionally  capital expenditures increased million 
offsetting these cash uses for investing activities are the million increase in net sales of our portfolio of marketable securities primarily used in the purchase of lastminute 
com and million of proceeds from the sale of our investments in karavel and trx 
the million decrease in cash used for investing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the year ago period primarily results from an million net increase in sales of marketable securities for our short term investment portfolio 
the net increase in sales of marketable securities is partially offset by million in investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and million in loans to business partners during the year ended december  compared to a net use of million for similar activities in the same period a year ago 
in addition  during the year ended december  we utilized million  net of cash acquired  for acquisitions compared to million in financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to a use of cash of million for the same period a year ago 
this was primarily due to the million in proceeds from our bridge facility that we used to acquire lastminute 
com 
additionally  a reduction in the number of shares of our common stock that we repurchased under our board authorized stock repurchasing plans resulted in a million reduction in cash outflows 
offsetting this decrease in shares of common stock repurchased was an increase in dividends paid of million due to an increase in our dividend rate from 
per share in to 
per share in proceeds from the issuance of common stock decreased million due to fewer employee stock option exercises resulting from a generally lower price of our common stock 
the million increase in cash used for financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the same period a year ago was mainly due to dividends of million paid in compared to million for and million used to repurchase our common stock during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in as compared to increased million due to a generally higher stock price 
in  million was used related to the termination of our syndicated lease facility on our headquarters buildings 
for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities of million related to common stock repurchases differs from the comparable change in stockholder s equity of million due to timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant relationships or agreements as of december  that would be considered an off balance sheet arrangement as defined by item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ 
we have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our audit committee 
although we believe these policies to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses each of our significant accounting policies 
booking fee cancellation reserve our sabre travel network sm segment records revenue for airline travel reservations processed through the sabre system at the time of the booking of the reservation 
however  if the booking is canceled in a later month  the booking fee must be refunded to the customer less a small cancellation fee 
therefore we record revenue net of an estimated amount reserved to account for future cancellations 
this reserve is calculated based on historical cancellation rates 
in estimating the amount of future cancellations that will require us to refund a booking fee  we assume that a significant percentage of cancellations are followed immediately by a new reservation  without loss of revenue 
this assumption is based on historical rates of cancellations that resulted in a new reservation and has a significant impact on the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected cancellation rates or changes in booking behavior  our estimates of future cancellations could be increased by a material amount and our revenue decreased by a corresponding amount 
at both december  and  our booking fee cancellation reserves were million 
in  the cancellation reserve remained the same due to immaterial changes in the rate per booking and flat booking levels for airline reservations 
this reserve is sensitive to changes in booking levels and the number of bookings priced under the terms of the dca year pricing option agreements 
for example  if booking volumes had been lower or the weighted average booking fee rate had been lower  the reserve balance would have been reduced by approximately million 
car and hotel commission reserves our travelocity segment receives commissions from travel suppliers for air travel  hotel rooms  car rentals  vacation packages and cruises booked through our travelocity websites 
commissions from air travel providers are recognized at the time of booking the reservations except for lastminute 
com entities that recognize revenue related to air travel at the time of departure 
the revenue recognition method used by lastminute 
com will be changed to conform to the remainder of our travelocity segment when adequate historical data on cancellations is developed 
commissions from car and hotel travel providers are recognized upon the scheduled date of travel consumption 
we record car and hotel commission revenue net of an estimated reserve for no shows 
if circumstances should change such that the cancellation rates are significantly higher than expected  it could have a significant impact on the amount reserved 
at december  and our reserve for car and hotel commissions was approximately million and million  respectively 
software revenue recognition our sabre airline solutions segment develops software that is generally sold as part of agreements which also require us to provide customization and implementation services 
such agreements are accounted for using contract accounting under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenue from license fees  when software is sold without associated customization or implementation services  is recognized when the software is delivered  fees are fixed and determinable  no undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered software and collection is probable 
at times  determining if all of these elements have been met requires judgment 
fees for software maintenance are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
the fees for software maintenance included in initial software license agreements is based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the services determined using actual renewal rates for software maintenance services 
the process of allocating fees based on vendor specific evidence of fair value can require judgment 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  failure to pay amounts due to us or others  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past write off history average percentage of receivables written off historically and the length of time the receivables are past due 
several of our airline customers are experiencing financial difficulty  some including united air lines  inc  us airways  inc 
and ata holdings corporation have sought bankruptcy protection and still others may consider bankruptcy relief 
we believe that we have appropriately considered the effects of these factors  as well as any other known customer liquidity issues  on the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
however  if demand for commercial air travel softens  due to prevailing economic conditions  terrorist acts  war or other incidents involving commercial air transport  or other factors  the financial condition of our customers may be adversely impacted 
business combinations during  and  we completed a number of acquisitions of other companies using the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
the fair values were determined by our management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets  including goodwill 
goodwill and long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or if impairment indicators exist 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  as generally estimated using a discounted future net cash flow projection  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
we evaluate five reporting units under sfas  which include sabre travel network  travelocity  sabre airline solutions  synxis and emerging businesses 
our synxis and emerging businesses reporting units are included with sabre travel network for segment reporting purposes 
the fair values used in our sfas evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of assumptions  including risk adjusted discount rates  future booking and transaction volume levels  future price levels  rates of growth in our consumer and corporate direct booking businesses and rates of increase in operating expenses 
we believe that the assumptions we have made in projecting future cash flows for the evaluations described above are reasonable 
however  if future actual results do not meet our expectations  we may be required to record an impairment charge  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires impairment testing whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist for an amortizable intangible asset  the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if our projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset  no impairment charge is recorded 
if our projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the intangible asset to its fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million on technology related assets 
in  we wrote off an intangible asset of approximately million associated with a supplier agreement that was terminated early 
no other significant impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets have been recorded 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets  the annual rate of increase in compensation for plan employees  the increase in costs of health care benefits and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
see note  employee benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assumptions used and for changes in the accrued benefit 
income and non income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves significant judgment and evaluation of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax laws 
as a result  we have established reserves for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
regarding value added taxes  we have established reserves regarding the collection of refunds which are subject to audit and collection risks in various regions of europe 
tax reserves are reviewed regularly pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies 
tax reserves are adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes and associated interest  such as the expiration of statutes of limitation  conclusion of tax audits  identification of additional exposure based on current calculations  identification of new issues  or the issuance of statutory or administrative guidance or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue 
the amount of our liability for taxes could exceed our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
seasonality the travel industry is seasonal in nature 
travel bookings for our sabre travel network business  and the revenue we derive from those bookings  decrease significantly each year in the fourth quarter  primarily in december 
customers generally book their november and december holiday leisure travel earlier in the year  and business travel declines during the holiday season 
travel bookings for our travelocity business decrease each year in the fourth quarter  primarily in december 
customers generally book their holiday leisure travel earlier in the year 
travelocity revenues are also impacted by the seasonality of travel bookings  but to a lesser extent since commissions from car and hotel travel providers and net rate revenue for vacation packages and hotel stays are recognized upon date of consumption 
in  the seasonal variations described above did continue  however  our revenues did not decline in the fourth quarter due to the acquisition of lastminute 
com 
we believe that the acquisition of lastminute 
com will cause revenues and net earnings to become more significant in the second and third quarters for the travelocity segment due largely to european travel patterns 
the following table sets forth our quarterly financial data unaudited  in thousands  except per share data 
gross profit has been adjusted for all quarters in order to conform to the reclassification of amortization of purchased technology to cost of revenues from selling  general and administrative expenses

revised  share based payments sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized on the income statement based on their fair values 
we are adopting sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method and  as a result  we will begin expensing options in with no restatement of prior periods 
all options granted prior to adoption will continue to be expensed using the fair value previously determined using the black scholes option pricing model and included in our pro forma disclosures  however  options granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas r will be valued using a lattice model which we believe provides us with a more reliable fair value 
stock option expenses will be recorded on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
sfas r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  as required under the current guidance 
we cannot estimate what the impact of this will be on our financing cash flows as it will depend on the future exercise behavior of option holders 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will impact pre tax income by approximately million or 
per share in although this amount may change based on the level of future grants of options  unforeseeable changes in our assumptions used in the lattice model such as our stock volatility and actual forfeiture rates not matching our current estimates 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the standard requires changing the accounting and reporting requirements of voluntary and mandatory unless the pronouncement provides other transition requirements changes in accounting principle by requiring retroactive application of the change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements  unless it is not practical to do so  rather than recording a cumulative catch up adjustment in net income in the year of the change 
reporting error corrections will be handled similar to a change in accounting principles 
the standard is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  this new accounting standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our interest rate swaps and interest on our bridge facility which is variable  based at our discretion on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus a borrowing spread or the prime rate  and is sensitive to changes in our credit rating 
offsetting some of this exposure is interest income received from our marketable securities portfolio 
the objectives of our marketable securities are preservation of principal  liquidity and yield 
as such  our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed or variable rate obligations issued by the us treasury  government agencies and municipalities  mutual funds  asset backed securities issued by banks  corporations  and bankruptcy remote trusts 
if short term interest rates average lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would decrease by approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if short term interest rates averaged lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our average marketable securities invested during and at december   we had obligations under our million bridge facility  fixed rate notes of million notes and a million capital lease obligation 
we have entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps related to million of the outstanding notes  effectively converting million of the million fixed rate notes into floating rate obligations 
we also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap that effectively converts million of the capital lease obligation into a floating rate obligation see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on the swaps 
if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our floating rate borrowings balance  including the bridge facility  at december  if our mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities changes significantly  we may enter into additional derivative transactions to manage our net interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk we have various operations outside of the united states  primarily in north america  south america  europe  australia and asia 
as a result of these business activities  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
during times of volatile currency movements this risk can materially impact our earnings 
to reduce the impact of this earnings volatility  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts on our three largest foreign currency exposures 
these forward contracts  totaling million at december  and million at december   represent obligations to purchase foreign currencies at a predetermined exchange rate to fund a portion of our expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
we also enter into short dated forward contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure related to lastminute 
com s travel supplier liability payments denominated in a foreign currency 
in december  we purchased foreign currency denominated government bonds to function as a hedge of a portion of our foreign currency exposure 
to protect these bond investments from foreign currency risk  we purchased put options on the currencies in which the government bonds are denominated 
these options gave us the right to sell the foreign currencies at predetermined prices 
there were no bonds or options outstanding as of december  the result of an immediate percent appreciation of the us dollar in from december  levels relative to our primary foreign currency exposures would result in a negative us dollar impact of approximately million in  net of hedge instruments outstanding 
this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projections of our primary foreign currency denominated expenses and foreign currency forwards as of december  report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal controls over financial reporting the board of directors and stockholders sabre holdings corporation we have audited management s assessment  included in the accompanying management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls  that sabre holdings corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria

because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

com  which is included in the consolidated financial statements of the company and constituted  million and  million of total assets and net assets  respectively  as of december  and million and million of revenues and net loss  respectively  for the year then ended 
management did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at lastminute
