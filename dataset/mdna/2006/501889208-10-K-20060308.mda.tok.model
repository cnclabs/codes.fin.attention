item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide replacement systems  components  and parts needed to repair light vehicles cars and light trucks 
buyers of light vehicle replacement products have the option to purchase from primarily three sources new products produced by original equipment manufacturers oems  which are commonly known as oem products  new products produced by companies other than the oems  which are sometimes referred to generically as aftermarket products  and recycled products originally produced by oems  which we refer to as recycled oem products 
we participate in the market for recycled oem products as well as the market for collision repair aftermarket products 
we obtain aftermarket products and salvage vehicles from a variety of sources  and we dismantle the salvage vehicles to obtain a comprehensive range of vehicle products that we distribute into the light vehicle repair market 
we are not involved in the manufacture of automotive products and do not maintain any manufacturing or remanufacturing operations 
our revenue  cost of goods sold  and operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
factors that may affect our operating results include  but are not limited to fluctuations in the pricing of new oem replacement products  the availability and cost of inventory  variations in vehicle accident rates  competition in the vehicle replacement parts industry  changes in state or federal laws or regulations affecting our business  changes in the types of replacement parts that insurance carriers will accept in the repair process  our ability to integrate and manage our acquisitions successfully  fluctuations in fuel prices  changes in the demand for our products and the supply of our inventory due to severity of weather and seasonality of weather patterns  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the maintenance and expansion of our business  operations  and infrastructure  and declines in the value of our assets 
due to the foregoing factors  our operating results in future periods can be expected to fluctuate 
accordingly  our historical results of operations may not be indicative of future performance 
acquisitions since our inception in we have pursued a growth strategy of both organic growth and acquisitions 
we have pursued acquisitions that we believe will help drive profitability  cash flow and stockholder value 
our principal focus for acquisitions is companies that will expand our geographic presence and our ability to provide a wider choice of alternative light vehicle replacement products and services to our customers 
during  we acquired three automotive recycling businesses located in upstate new york  california and nevada  respectively  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  million in notes issued and  redeemable shares of our common stock 
these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new market areas 
during  we acquired six businesses five in the recycled oem automotive parts business and one in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  million in notes issued and  shares of our common stock 
these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets  expand our presence in certain markets  become a significant provider of aftermarket automotive replacement parts and become a provider of self service retail automotive parts 
one of the acquisitions had operations in guatemala and costa rica 
the revenue of the central american businesses is not material  but we are using these facilities as a platform to sell certain types of products into central america from our us based recycled oem automotive replacement parts facilities 
during  we acquired eight businesses four in the recycled oem automotive parts business and four in the aftermarket automotive parts business for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  million in notes issued and million contingently payable based on the achievement of certain future financial results 
these business acquisitions enabled us to serve new markets and expand our presence in existing markets 
in the first quarter of  we completed an acquisition in the wheel refurbishment and distribution business  with four locations for the refurbishment and distribution of wheels and two additional distribution locations 
this acquisition allows us to expand our product offerings to our customers 
we also acquired three recycled oem automotive parts businesses two in the self serve retail business in the first quarter 
these business acquisitions enable us to expand our presence in existing markets and serve new market areas 
sources of revenue since  our revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products and related services has ranged between and of our total revenue 
we sell the majority of our light vehicle replacement products to collision repair shops and mechanical repair shops 
our light vehicle replacement products include  for example  engines  transmissions  front ends  doors  trunk lids  bumpers  hoods  fenders  grilles  valances  headlights  and taillights 
we sell extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products 
these contracts cover the cost of parts and labor and are sold for periods of six months  one year  or two years 
we defer the revenue from such contracts and recognize it ratably over the term of the contracts 
the demand for our products and services is influenced by several factors  including the number of vehicles in operation  the number of miles being driven  the frequency and severity of vehicle accidents  availability and pricing of new parts  seasonal weather patterns  and local weather conditions 
additionally  automobile insurers exert significant influence over collision repair shops as to how an insured vehicle is repaired and the cost level of the products used in the repair process 
accordingly  we consider automobile insurers to be key demand drivers of our products 
we provide insurance companies services that include the review of vehicle repair order estimates  as well as direct quotation services to their adjusters 
there is no standard price for recycled oem products  but rather a pricing structure that varies from day to day based upon such factors as product availability  quality  demand  new oem replacement product prices  the age of the vehicle being repaired  and competitor pricing 
the pricing for aftermarket products is determined based on a number of factors  including availability  quality  demand  new oem replacement product prices  and competitor pricing 
since  approximately to of our revenue has been obtained from other sources 
these include bulk sales to mechanical remanufacturers  scrap sales  and sales of damaged vehicles that we sell to vehicle repairers 
when we obtain mechanical products from dismantled vehicles and determine they are damaged  or when we have a surplus of a certain mechanical product type  we sell them in bulk to mechanical remanufacturers 
the majority of these products are sorted by product type and model type 
examples of such products are engine blocks and heads  transmissions  starters  alternators  and air conditioner compressors 
after we have recovered all the products we intend to resell  the remaining materials are crushed and sold to scrap processors 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold for recycled oem products includes the price we pay for the salvage vehicle and  where applicable  auction  storage  and towing fees 
our cost of goods sold also includes labor and other costs we incur to acquire and dismantle such vehicles 
since  our labor and labor related costs related to acquisition and dismantling have accounted for approximately of our cost of goods sold for vehicles we dismantle 
the acquisition and dismantling of salvage vehicles is a manual process and  as a result  energy costs are not material 
our cost of goods sold for aftermarket products includes the price we pay for the parts  freight  and other inventoried costs such as other costs to acquire  including import fees and duties  where applicable 
our aftermarket products are acquired from a number of vendors located primarily overseas  with the majority of our overseas vendors located in taiwan 
in the event we do not have a recycled oem product or suitable aftermarket product in our inventory  we attempt to purchase the part from a competitor 
we refer to these parts as brokered products 
since  the revenue from brokered products that we sell to our customers has ranged from to of our total revenue 
the gross margin on brokered product sales as a percentage of revenue is generally less than half of what we achieve from sales of our own inventory because we must pay higher prices for these products 
some of our mechanical products are sold with a standard six month warranty against defects 
we record the estimated warranty costs at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 
our warranty activity during and was as follows in thousands balance as of january  warrant expense warranty claims balance as of december  warranty expense warranty claims balance as of december  we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products 
the expense related to extended warranty claims is recognized when the claim is made 
expenses our facility and warehouse expenses primarily include our costs to operate our processing  redistribution  self service  and warehouse facilities 
these costs include labor for both plant management and facility and warehouse personnel  facility rent  property and liability insurance  utilities  and other occupancy costs 
our distribution expenses primarily include our costs to deliver our products to our customers 
included in our distribution expense category are labor costs for drivers  local delivery and transfer truck rentals and subcontractor costs  vehicle repairs and maintenance  insurance  and fuel 
our selling and marketing expenses primarily include our advertising  promotion  and marketing costs  salary and commission expenses for sales personnel  sales training  telephone and other communication expenses  and bad debt expense 
since  personnel costs have accounted for approximately of our selling and marketing expenses 
most of our recycled oem product sales personnel are paid on a commission basis 
the number and quality of our sales force is critical to our ability to respond to our customers needs and increase our sales volume 
our objective is to continually evaluate our sales force  develop and implement training programs  and utilize appropriate measurements to assess our selling effectiveness 
our general and administrative expenses include primarily the costs of our corporate and regional offices that provide corporate and field management  treasury  accounting  legal  payroll  business development  human resources  and information systems functions 
seasonality our operating results are subject to quarterly variations based on a variety of factors  influenced primarily by seasonal changes in weather patterns 
during the winter months we tend to have higher demand for our products because there are more weather related accidents 
in addition  the cost of salvage vehicles tends to be lower as more weather related accidents occur generating a larger supply of total loss vehicles 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  warranty costs  inventory valuation  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill impairments  self insurance programs  contingencies  asset impairments  and taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and our recognition of revenue 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize and report revenue from the sale of light vehicle replacement products when they are shipped and title has transferred  subject to a reserve for returns  discounts  and allowances that management estimates based upon historical information 
a replacement product would ordinarily be returned within a few days of shipment 
our customers may earn discounts based upon sales volumes or sales volumes coupled with prompt payment 
allowances are normally given within a few days following product shipment 
we analyze historical returns and allowances activity by comparing the items to the original invoice amounts and dates 
we use this information to project future returns and allowances on products sold 
we also sell separately priced extended warranty contracts for certain mechanical products 
revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
warranty reserves we issue a standard six month warranty against defects on some of our mechanical products 
we record an accrual for standard warranty claims at the time of sale using historical warranty claim information to project future warranty claims activity and related expenses 
we analyze historical warranty claim activity by referencing the claims made and aging them from the original product sale date 
we use this information to project future warranty claims on actual products sold that are still under warranty at the end of an accounting period 
a increase in our historical annual warranty claims would result in an additional annual expense of approximately million 
inventory accounting salvage inventory 
salvage inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
our salvage inventory cost is established based upon the price we pay for a vehicle  and includes buying  dismantling  and  where applicable  auction  storage  and towing fees 
inventory carrying value is determined using the average cost to sales percentage at each of our facilities and applying that percentage to the facility s inventory at expected selling prices 
the average cost to sales percentage is derived from each facility s historical vehicle profitability for salvage vehicles purchased at auction or from contracted rates for salvage vehicles acquired under direct procurement arrangements 
aftermarket inventory 
aftermarket inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
our aftermarket inventory cost is based on the average price we pay for parts  and includes expenses incurred for freight and buying  where applicable 
for items purchased from foreign sources  import fees and duties and transportation insurance are also included 
for all inventory  our carrying value is reduced regularly to reflect the age and current anticipated demand for our products 
if actual demand differs from our estimates  additional reductions to our inventory carrying value would be necessary in the period such determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  and our historical experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was approximately million  which represents of gross receivables 
if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our allowance for doubtful accounts may be insufficient to cover the uncollectible receivables  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period of occurrence 
a change in the annual write off rate would result in a change in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable is limited because we have a large number of small customers that are generally geographically dispersed 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  credit limits  and monitoring policies 
we also have certain customers that pay for products at the time of delivery 
goodwill impairment we record goodwill as a result of our acquisitions 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we refer to as sfas  requires us to analyze our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events may indicate that an impairment exists 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
we utilize outside professionals in the valuation industry to validate our assumptions and overall methodology used to determine the fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment testing 
as of december   we had million in goodwill subject to future impairment tests 
if we were required to recognize goodwill impairments in future periods  we would report those impairment losses as part of our operating results 
we determined that no adjustments were necessary when we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  and a decrease in the fair value estimates used in the fourth quarter of impairment test would not have changed this determination 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if our review indicates that the carrying value of long lived assets is not recoverable  we reduce the carrying amount of the assets to fair value 
we have had no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in   or self insurance programs we self insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program 
we also self insure a portion of automobile  general liability  and workers compensation claims 
we have purchased stop loss insurance coverage that limits our exposure to both individual claims as well as our overall claims 
the cost of the stop loss insurance is expensed over the contract periods 
we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits  automobile  general liability  and workers compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims 
if actual claims are higher than what we anticipated  our accrual might be insufficient to cover our claims costs  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
if we were to incur claims up to our aggregate stop loss insurance coverage during the open policy years  we would have an additional expense of approximately million 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business resulting from litigation  claims and other commitments  and from a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we determine the amount of reserves  if any  with the assistance of our outside legal counsel 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether the accruals should be adjusted 
if the amount of an actual loss were greater than the amount we have accrued  the excess loss would have an adverse impact on our operating results in the period that the loss occurred 
if the loss contingency is subsequently determined to no longer be probable  the amount of loss contingency previously accrued would be included in our operating results in the period such determination was made 
accounting for income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and we determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based upon various estimates and assumptions 
in the normal course of business we will undergo tax audits by various tax jurisdictions 
such audits often require an extended period of time to complete and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
although we have recorded all probable income tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  these accruals represent estimates that are subject to the inherent uncertainties associated with the tax audit process  and therefore include contingencies 
we record a provision for taxes based upon our expected annual effective income tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we expect is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider historical taxable income  expectations  and risks associated with our estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we had a valuation allowance of million  million  and million at december  and and  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends arb  chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage must be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
under the standard  companies will no longer be able to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
instead  sfas r requires the adoption of a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas r is effective for us as of january  we have historically accounted for stock based compensation to employees under apb no 
s intrinsic value method and accordingly  have generally not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective method  in which prior periods are not restated and compensation expense for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized prospectively based upon the requirements of sfas r and compensation expense for all unvested share based payments as of january  that were issued subsequent to our initial public offering in october is recognized prospectively based on sfas in applying the fair value concepts of sfas r  we will be required to choose among alternative valuation models and other assumptions 
our current estimates concerning indicate we will recognize equity based compensation expense of approximately per diluted share 
this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize our assumptions  including the amount of future awards and forfeiture rates 
sfas r also requires us to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies that arise subsequent to adopting sfas r the apic pool 
we are currently evaluating the acceptable methods for calculating our apic pool 
sfas r further requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized book compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow item as opposed to an operating cash flow item 
we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on  among other things  future employee stock option exercises and the price of our stock if and when such exercises occur 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirements an interpretation of sfas no 
fin 
fin clarifies that uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation 
we have adopted fin and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas requires retrospective application of the direct effect of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements where it is practicable to do so 
sfas also redefines the term restatement to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  unless adopted early 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  except to the extent that the statement subsequently requires retrospective application of a future item 
segment reporting over of our operations are conducted in the us during  we acquired a recycled oem products business with locations in guatemala and costa rica 
revenue generated and properties located outside of the us are not material 
we manage our operations geographically 
our light vehicle replacement products operations are organized into nine operating segments  eight for recycled oem products and one for aftermarket products 
these segments are aggregated into one reportable segment because they possess similar economic characteristics and have common products and services  customers  and methods of distribution

as a result  we saw our gross margin improve in the fourth quarter compared to our third quarter 
facility and warehouse expenses 
facility and warehouse expenses increased  from million in to million in our acquisitions accounted for million of the increase 
our remaining facility and warehouse expenses increased primarily due to higher wages resulting from increased headcount and higher repairs and maintenance expenses

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of ongoing liquidity are cash flow from our operations and our credit facility 
at december   we had cash and equivalents amounting to million  and we had million outstanding under our million unsecured bank credit facility 
we generated million in cash flow from operating activities in and based on our current plans  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operating activities for we believe that cash flow from operating activities and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our short term liquidity needs 
our liquidity needs are primarily to fund working capital requirements and expand our facilities and network 
the procurement of inventory is the largest operating use of our funds 
we normally pay for salvage vehicles acquired at salvage auctions and under some direct procurement arrangements at the time that we take possession of the vehicles 
we normally pay for aftermarket parts purchases at the time of shipment or on standard payment terms  depending on the manufacturer and payment options offered 
we acquired approximately   and  wholesale salvage vehicles in   and  respectively 
in addition  we acquired approximately  and  salvage vehicles for our self service retail operations in and  respectively 
our purchases of aftermarket parts totaled approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we completed the sale of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a public offering in october  as adjusted for our january two for one stock split 
this resulted in approximately million of cash proceeds to us  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses of the offering 
in connection with the offering  certain members of management exercised stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock  resulting in approximately million of proceeds to us 
we used all of the proceeds from the offering and the option exercises to pay down our then outstanding bank debt and invested the remaining proceeds in short term cash equivalents until we used them for general corporate purposes  which included three acquisitions completed by the end of the year 
we intend to continue to evaluate markets for potential growth through the internal development of redistribution centers  processing facilities  and aftermarket warehouses  through further integration of aftermarket and recycled oem product facilities  and through selected business acquisitions 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the costs and timing of our internal development efforts and the success of those efforts  the costs and timing of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  and the costs and timing of future business acquisitions

the percentage added to ibor is dependent upon our total funded debt to ebitda ratio for the trailing four quarters 
we may in the future borrow additional amounts under our credit facility or enter into new or additional borrowing arrangements 
we anticipate that any proceeds from such new or additional borrowing arrangements will be used for general corporate purposes  including to develop and acquire businesses and redistribution facilities  to further the integration of our aftermarket  wheel refurbishing and recycled oem product facilities  to expand and improve existing facilities  to purchase property  equipment  and inventory  and for working capital

the counterparty to the agreement was a member of our bank group

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are included in current period earnings  as the agreement had not been designated as a hedging instrument

the notes bear interest at annual rates of to  and interest is payable at maturity 
we also assumed certain liabilities in connection with a business acquisition  which included a promissory note with a remaining principal balance of million 
the annual interest rate on that note is we estimate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million  excluding business acquisitions 
we expect to use these funds for four major facility expansions  improvement of current facilities  consolidation of two wholesale recycling operations and conversion of one to a self service operation  real estate acquisitions and systems development projects 
we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities for will be approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our current operating and capital requirements 
however  we may  from time to time  raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships  or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  or refinancing of our credit facility  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital if and when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our results of operations are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  where interest rates are tied to either the prime rate or ibor 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
our previous secured credit facility required that we enter into an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate our interest rate risk on a portion of the balance outstanding 
we do not however  as a matter of policy  enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the swap agreement  which expired on august   had a notional amount of million under which we paid a fixed rate of interest of and received payments based upon variable rates 
the swap agreement was not designated as a hedging instrument and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the swap agreement were included in current period earnings 
we recorded non cash credits of  and  during and  respectively  related to the change in fair value of the interest rate swap agreement 
based upon our variable rate debt at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately million 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations with respect to the purchase of aftermarket parts in taiwan 
while all transactions with manufacturers based in taiwan are conducted in us dollars  changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar might impact the purchase price of aftermarket parts 
we might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers 
under our present policies  we do not attempt to hedge this currency exchange rate exposure 
our investment in our central american operations is not material  and we do not attempt to hedge our foreign currency risk related to such operations
