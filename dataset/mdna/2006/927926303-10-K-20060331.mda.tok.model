item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
reference to note to the consolidated financial statements should be made for a discussion of differences between canadian and united states gaap and their effect on the financial statements 
all amounts stated herein are in us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
overview we are engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects with the aim of adding value to the projects 
our approach to acquisitions of gold projects has generally been to seek projects within political jurisdictions with well established mining  land ownership and tax laws  which have adequate drilling and geological data to support the completion of a third party review of the geological data and to complete an estimate of the mineralized material 
in addition  we look for opportunities to improve the value of our gold projects through exploration drilling or introducing technological innovations 
we expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition and improvement will continue in the future 
our holdings include the maverick springs  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills and wildcat projects and the hycroft mine  all in nevada  the long valley project in east central california  the yellow pine project in idaho  the paredones amarillos and the guadalupe de los reyes projects in mexico  the amayapampa project in bolivia  the awak mas project in indonesia  and properties acquired in connection with the december acquisition of f 
w 
lewis  inc  which includes patented and unpatented mining claims on properties in nevada and three properties in colorado 
we also own several exploration claims in canada and approximately of the shares of zamora gold corp  a company exploring for gold in ecuador 
effective march   we agreed to purchase the mt 
todd gold mine in northern territory  australia see consolidated financial statements note 
outlook gold prices started at per ounce and finished the year at per ounce as quoted on the london exchange 
this rise of approximately during the year reflected factors such as rising oil prices  global instability  real and threatened terrorism activities  the war in iraq  and the rise and demand for investment and jewelry 
current prices are at a year high and no assurance can be given that such prices will be sustained 
at the end of  we owned or controlled twelve properties containing mineralized material 
we expect that emphasis on gold project acquisition will continue in the future 
in addition  through exploration drilling and engineering studies  we believe that additional value can be added to most of the projects by advancing them closer to a production decision 
we do not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained gold prices  we expect to generate revenues and cash flows in the future 
we may generate revenues and cash flows from our portfolio of gold projects by several means  including but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sales for cash and or royalties  or project development and operation 
with respect to our current property holdings  aggregate expenditures for purchase installments  to maintain options and conduct exploration activities are currently anticipated being approximately  in and  in at present  we would anticipate raising funds to meet these long term obligations through equity private placements  or joint venture efforts or sale of properties currently controlled 
in subsequent years  we anticipate that we will need to raise additional capital to meet property purchase installment obligations and scheduled payments on those properties that we decide to retain under option 
further  additional capital would be necessary to acquire properties and conduct exploration drilling and re engineering studies on current and newly acquired properties 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in efforts to raise additional capital 
results from operations summary our consolidated net loss was million or per share compared to the consolidated net loss of million or per share for a net decrease of million 
the decrease of million in is primarily due to decreased stock based compensation expense of million resulting from fewer stock option grants during as compared to and increased interest income of million due to increased investment in our liquid savings account  partially offset by increased exploration and property evaluation costs of million and increased general and administrative costs of million 
as compared to a consolidated net loss of million or per share in  the consolidated net loss increased by million 
the increase in includes a stock option charge of million resulting from the adoption of the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica standard  cica which requires the fair value of stock compensation for employees to be expensed  an increase of million for exploration  property evaluation and holding costs  increased general and administrative costs of million  and increased investor relations costs of million 
gold production and revenue the hycroft mine is on care and maintenance 
mining activities were suspended at hycroft in and  as expected  gold production has ceased 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine and reporting the associated sales proceeds as revenue was no longer warranted 
accordingly  gold revenues in  and therefore were nil 
gold production costs  which were offset by proceeds received from gold sales of million in are no longer recorded as production costs  but are accounted for as exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
recorded  and production costs are therefore nil 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased approximately million from million in to million in exploration costs increased million from million in to million in hycroft holding costs decreased slightly  from million in to million in other property holding costs associated with the care and maintenance of paredones amarillos and minera nueva vista increased slightly  from million in to million in exploration  property evaluation and holding costs increased approximately million from million in to million in exploration costs increased by million in the increase in net holding costs for the hycroft mine of approximately million primarily contributes to the overall increase noted 
actual holding costs for the hycroft mine did not in fact increase from the prior year  but rather  gold recovery from the heap leach pads decreased from resulting in the net increase in costs 
corporate administration and investor relations corporate administration and investor relations was million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million 
this increase reflects the continuation of our comprehensive investor relations program which  in  included a mass marketing campaign of million 
corporate administration and investor relations costs were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million 
this increase is the result of a more comprehensive investor relations program  the cost of which increased million from  and a million increase in general expenses and payroll costs with the addition of personnel and the use of consultants during the year 
depreciation and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization were approximately million in each of  and in each case  there was no significant change in the depreciation  depletion and amortization costs from the previous year 
other income and expenses provisions for reclamation and mine closure costs during  there were no costs associated with mine closure costs or reclamation provisions 
during  we increased our accrued mine closure costs by  for employee severance accruals 
with consideration given to this increase  the accrued reclamation obligation and mine closure costs at year end was million as compared to million in as previously noted  effective january   we have adopted the new accounting standard for asset retirement obligations  cica we regularly review the fair value of reclamation obligation estimates where any increase in the fair value of the estimate will be recorded in the period in which the increase is incurred 
the application of this standard did not result in an increase in the reclamation obligations during the year stock based compensation on january   we retroactively adopted  without restatement of prior years  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  cica this standard requires that we record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock option grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the adoption of the fair value method resulted in a cumulative increase of  to the opening deficit at january  and increases of  and  to common share capital and stock options  respectively  at january  previously we recorded only those expenses associated with stock options granted to non employees based upon the fair value on the earlier date of completion of performance or vesting of the options granted 
we did not record any compensation cost on grants of stock options to employees and directors prior to january  during the twelve months ended december    stock options  vesting over a period of two years  in each year  were issued to employees of vista gold and have been recorded  using the black scholes option pricing model  at an estimated fair market value of  of this amount   represents the fair market value of the  options immediately vested and  represents the amortization during of the  options vesting over time 
in addition  compensation expense of  was recognized during  for options granted in prior years and vesting over time 
also  during  stock options granted to employees in november were cancelled before they were fully vested 
amortization of  that was originally recorded as stock based compensation expense has been reversed  accordingly 
during the twelve months ended december  we did not grant any stock options to non employee consultants 
during the twelve months ended december   we granted  stock options to directors  officers and employees valued  using the black scholes option pricing model  at  also  during  compensation expense of  was recognized for options granted in prior years and vesting over time 
during  we granted  stock options to non employees valued at  compared to  options granted to non employees in valued at  we valued the granted options in both and using the black scholes model 
loss gain on disposal of marketable securities in  we realized a gain on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a loss of  in in  we realized a loss on disposal of marketable securities of  compared to a gain of  in in march of  a  write down to fair market value was made to reflect an estimated  fair market value of our  common shares of golden phoenix minerals  inc gpmi received in in connection with our facilitation of the usf g settlement that year

gain on disposal of assets net gains of  on disposal of assets were recorded in as compared to net gains of  in  in both cases resulting from the sale of equipment at the hycroft mine 
we did not realize any net gains or losses on asset sales in loss on foreign currency translation foreign currency translation losses of  were incurred in compared to no losses or gains in  and a loss of  in the decrease of  is related to property obligation accruals and payments in these transactions include the accrual of a cdn  liability for the purchase of the paredones amarillos project in and the subsequent payment of the liability in interest income and expense during   and  we did not incur any interest expense as we had no commercial debt during these years 
during  we realized  in interest income as compared to  in and  in the increase of  in is primarily attributable to interest earned on the hycroft mine restricted cash account see consolidated financial statements note of  in as compared to  in and nil in also contributing to the increase in interest income are carryover balances from the equity private placement completed in september which raised approximately million

see the consolidated financial statements note acquisition of mt 
todd gold mine  northern territory  australia as previously reported  effective march   vista gold corp 
and its subsidiary vista gold australia pty ltd 
entered into agreements with ferrier hodgson  the deed administrators for pegasus gold australia pty ltd 
pegasus  the government of the northern territory of australia and the jawoyn association aboriginal corporation jaac and other parties named therein  subject to regulatory approvals  to purchase the mt 
todd gold mine also known as the yimuyn manjerr gold mine in the northern territory  australia 
under these agreements  vista gold corp 
is guarantor of the obligations of its subsidiary vista gold australia pty ltd 
vista australia and with vista gold corp  referred to as vista gold in summaries of agreement terms herein 
as part of the agreements  vista gold has agreed to pay pegasus approximately  and receive a transfer of the mineral leases and certain mine assets  and pay the northern territory s costs of management and operation of the mt 
todd site up to a maximum of approximately  during the first year of the term initial term is five years  subject to extensions  and assume site management and pay management and operation costs in following years 
additionally  vista gold corp 
is to issue its common shares with a value of cdn 
million amounting to  common shares as consideration for the jaac entering into the agreement and for rent for the use of the surface overlying the mineral leases until a decision is reached to begin production 
other agreement terms provide that vista gold will undertake a technical and economic review of the mine and possibly form one or more joint ventures with the jaac 
we anticipate that the transactions contemplated under the agreements will be completed and effective by july the amounts set forth above have been transferred to escrow accounts and will be released at that time 
see the consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant areas requiring the use of estimates include mine closure and reclamation obligations  useful lives for asset depreciation purposes  impairment of mineral properties and stock based compensation 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
mineral properties mineral property acquisition costs and exploration costs are recorded at cost and are deferred until the viability of the property is determined 
general overhead  administrative and holding costs to maintain a property on a care and maintenance basis are expensed in the period they are incurred 
if a project would be put into production  capitalized costs would be depleted on the unit of production basis 
option payments and reimbursements received are treated as a recovery of mineral property costs 
option payments are at the discretion of the optionee and accordingly are accounted for on a cash basis or when receipt is reasonably assured 
management of the corporation regularly reviews the net carrying value of each mineral property 
where information and conditions suggest impairment  estimated future cash flows are calculated using estimated future prices  proven and probable reserves  weighted probable outcomes and operating capital and reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis 
if it is determined that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  a write down to the estimated fair value is made with a charge to loss for the period 
where estimates of future net cash flows are not available and where other conditions suggest impairment  management assesses if carrying values can be recovered 
asset retirement obligation and closure costs the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
stock based compensation and other stock based payments on january   the corporation retroactively adopted  without restatement of prior years  the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  cica this standard requires that the corporation record compensation expense on the granting of all stock based compensation awards  including stock options grants to employees  calculated using the fair value method 
the adoption of the fair value method resulted in a cumulative increase of  to the opening deficit at january   and increases of  and  to common share capital and stock options  respectively  at january  previously  the corporation recorded only those expenses associated with stock options granted to non employees and directors prior to january  when an employee or non employee exercises stock options  then the fair value of the options on the date of the grant is transferred to common stock 
when options are forfeited then the vested fair value balance of the stock options is transferred to contributed surplus  while any unvested portions are reversed out accordingly 
when options expire  the related fair value is transferred to contributed surplus 
deferred stripping costs in october  the cica emerging issues committee eic issued for comment a draft abstract  eic d accounting for deferred stripping costs in the mining industry 
if adopted  this eic would require stripping costs to be accounted for as variable production costs to be included in inventory unless the stripping activity can be shown to be a betterment of the mineral property  in which case the stripping costs would be capitalized 
a betterment occurs when stripping activity increases future output of the mine by providing access to additional sources of reserves 
capitalized stripping costs would be amortized on a units of production basis over the proven and probable reserves to which they relate 
as of december  the corporation did not have any deferred stripping costs 
should eic d be adopted  the corporation will continue to defer stripping costs of major mine expansions which allow the corporation to mine reserves not previously included in the reserve base 
in  the corporation does not expect to defer any costs associated with mine expansion 
non monetary transactions cica handbook section non monetary transactions will be applicable to the corporation commencing with the financial year 
reporting of the corporation s results is not expected to be materially effected by this standard 
derivative instruments in january  the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica issued three new standards relating to financial instruments 
these standards are applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after october  the corporation is currently reviewing the impact of these new standards 
these standards are as follows financial instruments recognition and measurement  section this standard prescribes when a financial asset  financial liability  or non financial derivative is to be recognized on the balance sheet and whether fair value or cost based measures are used 
it also specifies how financial instrument gains and losses are to be presented 
hedges  section this standard is applicable when a company chooses to designate a hedging relationship for accounting purposes 
it builds on the existing accounting guideline acg hedging relationships  and section foreign currency translation  by specifying how hedge accounting is applied and what disclosures are necessary when it is applied 
comprehensive income  section this standard introduces new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income 
comprehensive income  which is currently reported under us gaap  is the change in shareholders equity net assets of an enterprise during a reporting period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non owner sources 
it includes changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners 
these items include minimum pension liability adjustments  holding gains and losses on certain investments  gains and losses on certain derivative instruments and foreign currency gains and losses related to self sustaining foreign operations cumulative translation adjustment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition of gold projects and related activities including exploration engineering  permitting and the preparation of feasibility studies 
the value of our properties is related to gold price and changes in the price of gold could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of gold projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for  and supply of  gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time 
because we have several exploration operations in north america and south america and in asia  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in currency hedging to offset any risk of currency fluctuations as insignificant monetary amounts are held for immaterial land holding costs related to the properties owned 
we have no debt outstanding  nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time
