overview overall demand for our products and services is driven by investments in manufacturing capacity  including upgrades  modifications  and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities  and the creation of new manufacturing facilities  our customers needs for greater productivity  cost reduction  quality  and overall global competitiveness  industry factors that include our customers new product introductions  trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services  and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate  levels of global industrial production  regional factors that include local political  social  regulatory and economic circumstances  and the seasonal capital spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting processes and their working schedules 
u

industrial economic trends in  sales in the us accounted for more than percent of our total sales 
the trend of improving conditions in the us manufacturing economy during and continued into the first half of and moderated somewhat in the second half 
the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets include industrial equipment spending  which is an economic statistic compiled by the bureau of economic analysis bea 
this statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad us industrial economy  which includes our primary customer base 
this measure  over the longer term  has proven to have reasonable predictive value  and to be a good directional indicator of our growth trend 
capacity utilization  which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the federal reserve 
historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their manufacturing base 
the purchasing managers index pmi  published by the institute for supply management ism  which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the us according to the ism  a pmi measure above indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below indicates that it is generally contracting 
the table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in us industrial equipment spending and capacity utilization  and the sustained strength in the pmi since december while we still expect moderate growth in  we are planning for a deceleration to a more sustainable level of growth in the us economy in industrial equipment capacity spending utilization in billions percent pmi fiscal september june march december fiscal september june march december fiscal september june march december note economic indicators are subject to revisions by the issuing organizations 
non us regional trends outside the us  demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets 
these customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies 
recent strength in demand has  in part  been driven by investment in infrastructure in developing economies  in basic materials production capacity in response to higher end product pricing and in expanding consumer markets 
we continue to see strong demand in china  india and latin america 
we also saw considerable growth in europe during the second half of  following nearly two years of little or no growth 
in  our european operations benefited from our targeted growth investments in customer facing resources as well as improving macro economic conditions 
we expect strong growth in latin america  europe and the emerging economies in asia pacific will continue into revenue by geographic region the table below presents our actual sales for the year ended september  by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended september  in millions  except percentages change excluding the effect of changes change vs

see supplemental sales information for information on this non gaap measure 
industry views we serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products  transportation  basic materials  and oil and gas 
during we benefited from growing demand in most of the industries we serve 
our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage  home  health and beauty  and life sciences industries 
these customers needs include global expansion  incremental capacity from existing facilities  an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance 
in addition  these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors 
as a result  consumer products customers capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of heavy manufacturing customers 
in transportation  factors such as plant closings  customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales 
while our global automotive revenue was flat in  our traditional north american automotive installed base experienced a significant slowdown during the second half of the year 
this had a negative impact on sales and operating earnings in our control systems business  primarily on sales of our logix and plc products 
our plan for does not anticipate any recovery 
our customers in basic materials industries  including mining  aggregates  metals  forest products and cement  all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials  both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries 
as energy prices rise  customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity 
during  high energy prices contributed to strong growth in resource and energy based industries 
in addition  higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider investing in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies  such as intelligent motor controls 
outlook for the following is a summary of key objectives for successfully complete the divestiture of the principal businesses of our power systems operating segment  execute our cost productivity initiatives  continue our globalization efforts with a particular focus on emerging markets  and sustain the growth of our integrated control and information architecture by accelerating the proliferation and adoption rate  enhancing features and functionality  and by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market 
our key objectives assume a certain amount of cost productivity in our cost productivity initiatives will likely include workforce reductions and facility rationalization 
these actions are consistent with the planned divestiture of most of our power systems operating segment and our globalization and cost productivity efforts 
costs associated with these actions will be recorded when the relevant recognition criteria have been met 
our outlook for is based on expected demand and assumes sustained momentum outside of north america with slower rates of growth in the us and canada than in the previous three years 
our outlook also assumes sustained momentum across most industrial end markets 
the actual growth reported in any particular quarter may out perform or lag that trend 
this oscillation of performance around a trend is attributed to the inherent variability in our business with short lead times and minimal backlog in our non project businesses 
extrapolation of growth rates or levels of profitability from any one quarter can lead to incorrect conclusions about future performance 
as of the date of filing this report  based upon current economic conditions and business trends  we expect to grow revenue in by to percent  consistent with our long term growth trend 
as of the date hereof  we also expect full year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average about percent for the full year  excluding the effect of acquisitions  divestitures or other items separately reported net of their related tax effects 
this tax rate assumes continued execution of our globalization strategy 
we also plan to generate free cash flow approximately equal to net income 
this guidance does not incorporate the impact of future acquisitions or divestures  including the planned divestiture of our dodge mechanical and reliance electric motors and motor repair services businesses

sales of our logix offering grew by more than percent compared to  which was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by logix 
growth in sales of our logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded addressable market 
our intelligent motor control products also delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extraction based and heavy industrial customers 
higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to the strong demand from these customers 
operating earnings segment operating earnings increased by percent compared to the increase in segment operating earnings is due to higher volume  cost productivity and favorable pricing that was somewhat offset by inflation

in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas r see note in the financial statements  which requires that we report excess tax benefits related to share based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow 
we have added this benefit back to our operating cash flow to present free cash flow on a basis that is consistent with our historical presentation 
in our opinion  free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments  service of debt principal  dividends and share repurchases 
we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies 
free cash flow was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september  free cash flow in includes voluntary contributions to our us pension plan of million compared to million of such contributions in in addition  increased capital spending and working capital in resulted from the operating growth and growth investments that occurred during the year 
commercial paper is our principal source of short term financing 
commercial paper borrowings outstanding at september  were million 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was percent 
at september   and throughout  we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding due to our cash position 
in october  we contributed million to our us qualified pension trust 
we funded the contribution with a combination of cash on hand and million of commercial paper borrowings 
in november  we sold owned properties in a sale leaseback transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately million 
we used the cash proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings 
in september of we received million of cash from the sale of our investment in rsc 
in  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock of which million shares did not settle until october the total cost of these shares was million  of which million was recorded in accounts payable at september  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million in we anticipate repurchasing stock in  the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions  stock price and other cash requirements 
at september  we had authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to approximately million additional shares through september  on november   we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to divest the principal businesses included in our power systems operating segment for billion  comprised of billion in cash and million in common stock of the acquirer 
the divestiture is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to close in our second fiscal quarter 
we expect to use a significant portion of the after tax cash proceeds to repurchase common stock  to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances  or to pursue growth opportunities 
we expect future significant uses of cash to include repurchases of common stock  repayments of short term borrowings  dividends to shareowners  capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans 
we expect capital expenditures in to be about million 
we expect to fund each of these future uses of cash with existing cash balances  cash generated by operating activities  commercial paper borrowings  divestures of businesses  a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  we have access to existing financing sources  including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at september  and percent at september in october  we entered into a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing million unsecured credit facilities 
in september we entered into a day million unsecured revolving credit facility 
both credit facilities remain in effect and we had not drawn down under either of them at september  or borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding 
the terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio was to exceed percent 
we were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at september  and in addition to our million and million credit facilities  short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately million at september  were available to foreign subsidiaries 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook standard poor s a a stable moody s p a positive fitch ratings f a stable among other uses  we can draw our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
this access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper 
under our current policy with respect to these ratings  we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facilities  if any  to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow  if needed  to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures 
if our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding 
in such event  the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings 
cash dividends to shareowners were million per share in and million per share in although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors  we expect to pay quarterly dividends in of per outstanding share 
certain of our contractual cash obligations at september  are payments by period total thereafter long term debt and interest a minimum operating lease payments b purchase obligations c total a the amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates 
the amounts include interest  but exclude the amounts to be received under an interest rate swap  the million fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap as permitted by sfas no

c this item includes long term obligations under agreements with various service providers 
we sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees 
see note in the financial statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans 
supplemental sales information we translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the united states using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
therefore  changes in currency rates affect our reported sales 
we believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  which is a non gaap financial measure  provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates 
we use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance 
we determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period s sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year 
we attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination 
the following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions year ended september  year ended september  sales sales excluding excluding the effect the effect of changes of changes in currency in currency currency exchange currency exchange sales translation rates sales translation rates us and canada europe  middle east and africa asia pacific latin america total company sales the following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our control systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in millions year ended september  year ended september  sales sales excluding excluding the effect the effect of changes of changes in currency in currency currency exchange currency exchange sales translation rates sales translation rates us and canada europe  middle east and africa asia pacific latin america total control systems sales critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management 
retirement benefits pension benefits pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts  including the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  the assumed annual compensation increase rate  the retirement rate  the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate 
changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods 
our global pension expense in was million compared to million in approximately percent of our global pension expense relates to our us qualified pension plan 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine our us pension expense included the following discount rate of percent compared to percent for  expected rate of return on plan assets of percent compared to percent for  and an assumed compensation increase rate of percent compared to percent for 
in  we made voluntary contributions of million to our primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to million in the pension protection act of was signed into law in august we are currently evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions 
we estimate our pension expense will be approximately million in  a decrease of approximately million from our estimated pension expense reflects the net cost related to changes in actuarial assumptions in the us pension plan and the benefit of the million contribution in october for  changes in actuarial assumptions include an increase in our discount rate to percent from the percent rate used in the discount rate is set as of our june th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 
our assumed rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to percent  compared to the percent assumed rate of return used in we considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption 
we intend  over time  to change the us plan s mix of investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities 
we have assumed a compensation increase rate of percent in compared to percent used in we established this rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension eligible earnings 
the following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of basis points in the assumptions for our us pension plans in millions pension benefits change in change in projected benefit net periodic benefit obligation cost discount rate rate of return additional information regarding pension benefits  including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment  is contained in note in the financial statements 
other postretirement benefits we estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions  including the discount rate and  for plans other than our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program  expected trends in the cost for healthcare services 
changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods 
the discount rate used to calculate our other postretirement benefits expense was percent compared to percent in 
for  the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will increase to percent 
the discount rate is set as of our june th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans 
effective october   we amended our primary us postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services 
as a result of this amendment to our primary us program  there is no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of january  net periodic benefit cost in was million compared to million in we expect net periodic benefit cost in of approximately million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate million 
the decreases are due primarily to the increase in the discount rate by basis points to percent and our transition of all eligible retirees to a more efficient medicare advantage plan 
additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in note in the financial statements 
revenue recognition we record sales of products and services  representing approximately percent of our consolidated sales  when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred  as may be required according to contract terms  or services have been rendered 
we recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting 
we record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable  we use the completed contract method for all others 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either i the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or ii units of delivery 
under the percentage of completion method  we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified 
we record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale 
we use shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
returns  rebates and incentives our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing oem customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product 
we also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates  account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria 
certain distributors are offered a right to return product  subject to contractual limitations 
we record accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience 
adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual 
a critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed 
if the time period were to change by percent  the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately million 
returns  rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided 
accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or  where a right of set off exists  as a reduction of accounts receivable 
the accrual for customer returns  rebates and incentives was million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
we use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
to determine fair value  we must make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates 
we perform our annual impairment test on non amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year 
as of the second quarter of  the estimated fair value of our reliance trademark exceeded its million net book value 
either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our electrical business group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value 
litigation  claims and contingencies we record liabilities for litigation  claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation 
we also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party 
at third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified  we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties 
at environmental sites where we are the only responsible party  we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation 
we do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value 
environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup 
to the extent that remediation procedures change  additional contamination is identified  or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected  the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change 
effective september   we adopted fin  which clarifies the guidance included in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
under fin  companies must accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition  construction  development or the normal operation of the long lived asset 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional 
identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities 
we estimated conditional asset retirement obligations using site specific knowledge and historical industry expertise 
the application of fin resulted in a charge  net of tax  of million included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended september  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
our reserve for environmental matters  net of related receivables  was million at september  and million at september  the reserve in includes million recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at september  resulting from our adoption of fin  see note in the financial statements for additional information 
during  we recorded adjustments totaling million  excluding the adoption of fin  to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to adjustments of million 
our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us legacy businesses for which we retained the responsibility to remediate 
the nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low 
as a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters  we expect that gradually  over a long period of time  our environmental obligations will decline 
however  changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations 
various lawsuits  claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business  including those pertaining to product liability 
as described in item legal proceedings  we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago 
see item for further discussion 
our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount 
claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers 
we estimate the reserve for product liability claims  excluding asbestos  using our claims experience for the periods being valued 
adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims 
the reserve for product liability claims was million at september  and million at september  additional information regarding litigation  claims and contingencies is contained in note in the financial statements 
income taxes we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various us federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
additionally  we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years 
our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
while we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns  taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions 
cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products  services  and or intellectual property as well as various us state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures 
we regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  according to the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we have recorded an accrual of million at september  and million at september  that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits  which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
a final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets in the amount of million at september  and million at september  related to non us net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards carryforwards based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction 
the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the carryforward amount will be realized 
our income would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more carryforwards than currently expected 
at the end of each interim reporting period  we estimate a base effective tax rate  which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income  permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies 
we use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year to date basis  excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects 
we recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk in addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities  we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 
our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
at september   we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of million at a weighted average interest rate of percent  we had no commercial paper or significant bank borrowings outstanding at september  or during the weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper borrowings was percent 
changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations 
in and  a percent increase in average market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations 
at september  we had million of unsecured commercial paper obligations outstanding with maturities of three days 
as these obligations mature  we issued  and anticipate continuing to issue  additional short term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings 
we had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was million at september  and million at september  the potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
we currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity 
in september  we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our million aggregate principal amount of notes  payable in  to floating rate debt based on six month libor 
the floating rate was percent at september  a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
in addition  we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars 
a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
we recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value in earnings immediately 
at september  and  we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro  british pound sterling  south korean won and swiss franc 
the use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations 
the following table indicates the total us dollar equivalents of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to short long contracts outstanding by currency september  euro british pound south korean won swiss franc other total all of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future 
we designated certain of these contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through november as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our consolidated balance sheet
