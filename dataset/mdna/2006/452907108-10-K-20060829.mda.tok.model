overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes issued patents in the us and approximately other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 

table of contents we have transitioned our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates 
consistent with our de emphasis on our diagnostic business  we no longer commercialize cea scan 
leukoscan will continue to be manufactured and commercialized by us in territories where regulatory approvals have been granted 
furthermore  as of june   research and development into diagnostic product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
from inception in until june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and have never earned a profit 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
research and development as of june   we employed professionals in our research and development departments and professionals in our pre clinical and clinical research departments 
in addition to salaries and benefits  the other costs associated with research and development include the costs associated with producing biopharmaceutical compounds  laboratory equipment and supplies  the costs of conducting clinical trials  legal fees and expenses associated with pursuing patent protection  as well as facilities costs 
we have spent approximately million  million and million in the aggregate for the fiscal years ended june   and respectively on research and development expenses 
with the completion in fiscal year of the manufacturing expansion to support our research and development efforts and prepare for future commercialization of our product candidates  we believe that our facilities are adequate to support our research and development activities for the next few years without the need for any material capital expenditures 

table of contents at any one time our scientists are engaged in the research and development of multiple therapeutic compounds 
because we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation  but rather aggregate research and development costs for accounting purposes  it is not possible for investors to analyze and compare the expenses associated with unsuccessful research and development efforts for any particular fiscal period  with those associated with compounds that are determined to be worthy of further development 
this may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and future prospects 
therapeutics we believe that each of our antibodies has therapeutic potential either when administered alone or when conjugated with therapeutic radioisotopes radiolabeled  chemotherapeutics or other toxins to create unique and potentially more effective treatment options 
the attachment of various compounds to antibodies is intended to allow the delivery of these therapeutic agents to tumor sites with greater precision than conventional radiation therapy or chemotherapeutic approaches 
this treatment method is designed to reduce the total exposure of the patient to the therapeutic agents  which ideally minimizes debilitating side effects 
we are currently focusing our efforts on unlabeled  or naked antibodies and antibodies conjugated with drugs or toxins  and to lesser extent on the use of radioisotopes  such as yttrium  sometimes referred to as y  and iodine  sometimes referred to as i epratuzumab our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  immu  is an unlabeled humanized antibody which targets an antigen  known as the cd marker  found on the surface of b lymphocytes  a type of white blood cells 
since b lymphocytes are involved in the production of autoantibodies  we reasoned that epratuzumab might show activity in the treatment of autoimmune diseases by affecting b cell levels and function 
our humanized cd antibody has been shown not to evoke any substantial anti epratuzumab antibodies in nhl patients  even after repeated dosing  making it a good candidate for treating patients with a chronic  non malignant disease 
in october  updated clinical results of epratuzumab in patients with sle were presented at the th annual scientific meeting of american college of rheumatology association of rheumatology health professionals 
the objective of this open label  single center study was to evaluate the safety  tolerability  lack of immunogenicity and early evidence of efficacy of epratuzumab  which was administered as a single agent every other week  for a total of four doses 
a scoring system called bilag british isle lupus assessment group was used to measure the level of disease activity in these patients prior to  and  at several time points  post administration of epratuzumab 
patients with mild to moderate systemic lupus erythematosus sle activity defined by global bilag scores of prior to treatment were enrolled 
a high bilag score indicates increased disease activity 
sle assessments after treatment demonstrated consistent clinical improvement  with decreased global bilag scores for all fourteen enrolled patients compared to the pre therapy scores 
specifically  nine out of fourteen patients had lowered their global bilag scores by or more twenty four hours post therapy 
furthermore  six of the seven patients who had returned for their six month check up retained clinical benefit 
in all patients  the treatment was well tolerated with infusions completed in about one hour  and no evidence of reactions or immunogenicity 
based on these positive results  we submitted an application with the us food and drug administration fda for fast track designation and in january  received notice from the agency granting epratuzumab fast track product designation for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe sle 
the fast track programs of the fda are designed to facilitate drug development and to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions  and that 
table of contents demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
as such  the fast track designation allows for close and frequent interaction with the agency 
a designated fast track drug may also be considered for priority review with a shortened review time  rolling submission  and accelerated approval if applicable 
in may  we initiated two pivotal phase iii clinical trials to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of epratuzumab for the treatment of patients with moderate and severe sle 
these pivotal trials are randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled  multi center studies using the bilag index to monitor and assess disease activity 
the trials have been named alleviate or alleviate lupus affliction with epratuzumab and validate its autoimmune safety and efficacy 
one trial  alleviate a  is for patients with severe sle flares  and the second trial  alleviate b  is for patients with moderately active sle 
with the consummation of the ucb agreement  future costs incurred related to these clinical trials are the responsibility of ucb 
sle is a serious autoimmune disease affecting approximately million americans  according to the lupus foundation of america 
in the us  women with sle outnumber men by a ratio of nine to one  and of female patients develop lupus between the ages of and at present  there is no cure for lupus and no new lupus drug has been approved in the us for nearly years 
lupus most often results in chronic inflammation and pain affecting various parts of the body  especially the skin  joints  blood  and kidneys 
the disease can be serious and life threatening 
current treatments used in medical practice include corticosteroids  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  immunosuppressives  and antimalarials 
another autoimmune indication that we are targeting with epratuzumab is sj gren s syndrome  a disease that currently affects between to million americans 
we presented results from our open label  non randomized  two center phase i ii trial in june   at the european league against rheumatism eular annual european congress of rheumatology 
fifteen patients with primary sj gren s syndrome were enrolled in this study to assess feasibility  safety  and early evidence of efficacy 
over an eight week period  patients received mg m of epratuzumab every two weeks for a total of four doses 
fourteen patients received all four infusions without reactions with a median infusion time of fifty minutes 
one patient discontinued the third infusion due to an acute infusion reaction  but completed the fourth infusion with no further reaction 
patients reported improvements in their clinical signs and symptoms that include dry eyes  dry mouth  fatigue  tender joints  tender points  tear and salivary flow 
specifically  twenty four hours after the last treatment  symptomatic improvements ranging from of patients experiencing tender joints to of patients with salivary flow were observed 
moreover  when these patients were evaluated twelve weeks post therapy  of patients who showed tender joints improvement retained clinical benefit  as did of patients with increased salivary flow 
a final evaluation is planned for six months after the last epratuzumab dose 
epratuzumab seems to show activity without causing a drastic drop in the number of circulating b lymphocytes  thus perhaps reducing the risk of infection 
consistent with our past clinical experience with the antibody  we have found a reduction of to in circulating b cells in the patients enrolled in both the sle and sj gren s syndrome trials 
this data suggests that b cell modulation may be the primary mechanism of action of epratuzumab  and that complete depletion of b cells is not necessary to provide a clinical benefit 
immu has also demonstrated good safety  tolerability  and clinical efficacy in more than patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma  resulting in reports published in the journal of clinical oncology and clinical cancer research 

table of contents while the clinical results to date have been encouraging  we are not able to determine when  if ever  epratuzumab will be approved for sale in the us or anywhere else 
even if it is approved  there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful or that we will ever receive revenues equal to our financial investment in this product candidate 
other therapeutic product candidates we also have in development a solid tumor therapeutic product candidate that targets an antigen known as carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea 
the cea antigen is abundant at the site of virtually all cancers of the colon and rectum and is associated with many other solid tumors  such as breast and lung cancers 
a phase ii trial has been completed in europe for immu hcea i in patients with proven or suspected metastatic colorectal cancer who failed chemotherapy 
we believe that the initial results with immu are encouraging 
this phase i ii trial with immu hcea y has completed enrollment in the united states and in europe in patients with advanced colorectal and pancreatic cancers 
we are not currently conducting clinical trials with our cea antibody  however  we are providing clinical supplies for an investigator sponsored phase ii clinical trial in germany  evaluating repeat dosing with immu we also are commencing clinical trials with immu anti cd for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases 
we are currently conducting clinical trials in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma with immu  and we are conducting clinical trials with immu for use in targeting anti muc antibody for pancreatic cancer therapy 
in addition to these three product candidates  we have several others in pre clinical development 
diagnostics we have transitioned our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates 
consistent with our de emphasis on our diagnostic business  we no longer commercialize cea scan 
we will continue to manufacture and commercialize leukoscan in territories where regulatory approvals have been granted 
furthermore  as of june   research and development into diagnostic product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 

table of contents we have concluded that the ucb agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and are amortizing the million payment received over the expected obligation period which is currently estimated to end in november if the obligation period estimate should change in the future  whether due to delays or acceleration of the ucb s clinical trials  this may affect the amortization period estimated to end in november contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue is recognized for royalties based on license sales of our product cea scan in japan and in europe 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms when royalty from licenses can be reliably measured and collectablity is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks since immunomedics operates in countries outside of the us  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks that arise from the nature of the contracts immunomedics executes with its customers  since  from time to time  contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular immunomedics subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by our foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers and affiliates under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  immunomedics recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in immunomedics receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by us as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  for intercompany transactions for which settlement is planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  the related foreign currency transaction gains or losses  as applicable  are reported in other expenses income in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our 
table of contents consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to the company s consolidated financial position 
stock based compensation prior to july   we granted stock options to our employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying shares of common stock at the date of grant and accounted for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
however  for purposes of disclosure only  we estimate the fair value of stock options through the use of option pricing models 
in determining the values to use in our option pricing model  we make several subjective estimates about the characteristics of the underlying stock and the expected timing of option exercise 
change to these estimates can change the fair value disclosures in our financial statements 
our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding stock options as of june   primarily to avoid stock based compensation charges upon the adoption of sfas r on july  this total additional compensation cost would have been approximately  the exercise price of all stock options was above market value of the common stock at the time of the accelerated vesting 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal year includes compensation cost for all share based compensation granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
due to the accelerated vesting prior to the adoption of sfas r noted above  the impact on the statement of operations for the year ended june  is not material 
the non vested share based compensation that is outstanding as of june  is  which is expected to be recognized over the next four fiscal years 
the results of adopting sfas r for the prior periods have not been restated 
impairment of assets immunomedics reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
make whole interest derivative liability the holders of the notes who convert their notes will also receive on the date of conversion a payment equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid interest  less interest actually previously paid or provided for  up to and including the maturity date of the notes  known as the make whole interest payment 
the make whole interest payment is considered a bifurcated derivative since the embedded call option can accelerate the settlement of the interest component of the debt cost at the holder s option 
changes in the fair value of the make whole interest payment are recorded in current period operations 
the fair value of this instrument was recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as 
table of contents derivative interest liability 
the initial value of the derivative interest liability associated with the make whole interest provision of  is recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the notes 
the value of this derivative liability is based on various inputs and assumptions such as the price of our stock at each balance sheet date and the stock s volatility 
although we expect the value of this liability to be zero upon maturity of the notes  changes in these inputs and assumptions  particularly the price of our common stock  will impact the value of this derivative liability at each balance sheet date 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or  primarily due to the impact of the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue from the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa ucb agreement  partially offset by lower product sales 
product sales were  lower in europe primarily due to a lack of saleable leukoscan product earlier in the year 
on january  approval was received from the european regulatory agency to market leukoscan for the revision to our manufacturing process 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year increased to  from  for the same period in  primarily from the recognition of a portion of the deferred revenue earned under the ucb agreement 
total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year declined by  to  from  in fiscal year due to the transfer of the sle clinical trials over to ucb as part of the ucb agreement  reduced spending for outside toxicity testing associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials and a concerted effort to limit spending to conserve cash during the year 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to lower sales of diagnostic kits 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  the decline in marketing expenses was due to de emphasis of the diagnostic product line 
general and administrative costs for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  this increase was primarily due to a charge of  for fees associated with the ucb agreement 
interest and other income for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to higher interest rates and increased level of cash available for investment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulting from the ucb agreement 
interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the  of senior convertible notes sold in april this increase included the amortization of a portion of the expenses associated with the debt issuance costs  the mark to market value adjustment of the debt discount  the change in the market value of the make whole derivative interest liability  and the make whole interest payment regarding the conversion of the senior convertible notes due may notes into shares of common stock 
in september a patent infringement suit with cytogen  inc and cr bard was settled for an undisclosed amount without any admission of fault or liability 
in connection with the settlement  we settled legal fees associated with the suit with the attorneys representing it in the case 
we recorded a litigation settlement gain in other income in the amount of  which includes the reversal of legal fees previously accrued for this patent suit 
the specific amount of the settlement  however  is undisclosed in accordance with the terms of the parties settlement agreement 

table of contents on august  at a special meeting of stockholders a majority of holders of our common stock approved an amendment to the certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized from million to million shares 
in addition  the shareholders voted to authorize shares of common stock for conversion if required  into common stock for the senior convertible notes and the warrants 
the notes and warrants were therefore no longer restricted as to conversion into shares of common stock 
the liability for the warrants was increased by  to reflect our common stock valuation 
this increase in the liability for the warrants was reflected in the statement of operations 
the warrants were reclassified to permanent equity during the first quarter  a reduction to the liability of 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
these tax benefits were partially offset by income tax provisions of  in for state tax purposes and  in for our european subsidiary

product sales were  lower in europe primarily due to a lack of saleable leukoscan product  as current production was waiting for submission to the european regulatory authorities 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period in  primarily due to the complete recognition of revenues associated with the development and license agreement with amgen  inc amgen agreement which declined from  in to in total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to the beginning of the phase iii trials for epratuzumab for the treatment of sle  as well as increased research and development efforts including outside toxicity testing associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to lower sales of in vitro diagnostic kits and other imaging products 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  the decline in marketing expenses was due to de emphasis of our diagnostic product line

interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this increase resulted primarily from the  of notes sold in april also included in interest expense in is amortization expense associated with the debt issuance costs  and the debt discount 

table of contents in september a patent infringement suit with cytogen  inc and cr bard was settled for an undisclosed amount without any admission of fault or liability 
in connection with the settlement  the company settled legal fees associated with the suit with the attorneys representing it in the case 
the company recorded a litigation settlement gain in other income in the amount of  which includes the reversal of legal fees previously accrued for this patent suit 
the specific amount of the settlement  however  is undisclosed in accordance with the terms of the parties settlement agreement 
at june  the liabilities outstanding related to the warrants from the notes were revalued based on our common stock price 
the valuation of the liability for these warrants was adjusted as of june  due to the decline in our common stock from per share on april  to per share 
as such  the gain from the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of  was recorded in the statement of operations 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
these tax benefits were partially offset by income tax provisions of  and  primarily from our european subsidiary for and  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our products in development were  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses decreased by  in or as compared to research and development expenses increased by  in or as compared to we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple products at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consists of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  research costs product development costs total 
table of contents research costs research costs in total decreased for the year ended june  by  or as compared to research costs increased by  in or as compared to the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following animal studies conducted by outside organizations in were  a decrease of  or from  as testing for toxicity studies for compounds in the preclinical stage were reduced based on the current status of product development 
the increase in over was  or a increase  was for testing for toxicity studies for compounds in the preclinical stage of development for epratuzumab for sle indications 
personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to this decline resulted primarily from employee attrition and cost savings efforts during the year 
for the fiscal year personnel costs decreased by  or over due to employee attrition and the increased focus to product development as compounds proceeded further in clinical trials 
facility costs decreased  in over levels  or 
this decrease was a result of a reduction in depreciation expense as assets acquired in previous years became fully depreciated 
product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by  or as compared to product development costs in total increased by  in or as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs in were  a decrease of  or as compared to this decrease was primarily due to employee attrition  a reduction in recruitment fees and other cost control efforts partially offset by salary increases 
personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to this small increase was primarily attributed to salary increases offset by employee attrition and cost control efforts in the manufacturing and clinical monitoring areas 
clinical trial expenses in were  an increase of  or over this increase is primarily the result of investigator expenses for enrollment at clinical sites  particularly for epratuzumab for the treatment of sle of approximately  clinical trial expenses in were  an increase of  or over this increase is primarily the result of the beginning of the phase iii clinical trials for epratuzumab for the treatment of sle  which incurred approximately  of expenses in patent expenses for were  a decrease of  or over  due to efforts to reduce professional fees incurred for patent filings and support 
for the fiscal year patent expenses were  an increase of  or over the increase for patent expenses in was primarily attributed to increased applications of patents in foreign locations and vigorous defense of existing patents 
facility costs in were  a decrease of  or from  due to lower maintenance and repairs expense 
facility costs in were  an increase of  or 
table of contents over the increases in facility costs in primarily relates to increased investment in our manufacturing facility and equipment that took place during the fiscal year 
as a result depreciation  utilities  maintenance and related expenses have increased 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or over this was a result of delayed production of clinical antibodies as part of cost control efforts and lower demand of the clinical trials in process 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or over this increase resulted from the increased production levels of the new manufacturing facility and growth needed for clinical trial demands in completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials the duration of patient follow up in light of trials results the number of clinical sites required for trials and the number of patients that ultimately participate liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities  revenue earned under licensing agreements and  to a lesser degree  from sales of cea scan and leukoscan  research grants from various sources and investment income 
at june   we had working capital of  representing an increase of  from  at june  the increase in working capital is a result of the may ucb agreement  partially offset by our loss on operations of  the increase of current liabilities as of june  was primarily due to  for deferred revenues relating to the recognition of revenue under the ucb agreement over the next fiscal year 
at june   we had long term debt  net of discounts and current portion  of  senior convertible notes due  and the new jersey economic development authority  and deferred revenues under the ucb agreement of  to be recognized after the fiscal year 
on may  we entered into the ucb agreement providing ucb an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  market and sell epratuzumab for the treatment of all autoimmune disease indications 
under the terms of the ucb agreement  we retained the rights to develop epratuzumab in the field of oncology  and ucb has an option to acquire development and commercialization rights to epratuzumab with respect to cancer indications at anytime prior to the first commercial sales thereof

however  there can be no assurance as to the amount of revenues  if any  these imaging products will provide 
we expect to have adequate cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations for at least the fiscal year 
cash requirements are expected to be at a lower level than in the fiscal year due to decreased spending for clinical trials  as ucb is assuming the expenses for conducting the sle phase iii clinical trials 
however  we do not believe that we will have adequate cash at the expected spending level to complete our other research and development programs 
as a result  we will require additional financial resources after we utilize our current liquid assets in order for us to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of our product candidates and regulatory filings 
additional financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable  if at all  and the terms of such financing may cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research and development programs 
if we obtain funds through collaborative partnerships  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements
