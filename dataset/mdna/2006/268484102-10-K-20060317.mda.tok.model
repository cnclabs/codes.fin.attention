revenues for air freight and ocean freight consolidations indirect shipments include reimbursements from customers for the cost of transporting such freight 
revenues for air freight and ocean freight agency or direct shipments  customs brokerage and other services  include only the fees or commissions for these services 
we believe that a comparison of gross revenues by product best measures the relative importance of our principal services  while a comparison of net revenue margins net revenues as a percent of gross revenues best measures the performance of each product line 
a comparison of operating expenses as a percent of net revenues considers the relationship between operating expenses and operating revenues

the increase is mainly associated with additional or larger replacement facilities to accommodate increased operations 
a portion of the increase in facility expense is due to a million net increase in facility accruals mainly covering north america 
in north america  we consolidated three facilities into our new facility in miami  which was completed in late we suble ased one of the north american facilities for less than our remaining obligation and accrued the net amount of lease payments we expect to pay over the remaining lease term 
during the year  we accrued additional lease expense in north america and europe on two vacant facilities due to unfavorable market conditions near the facilities 
we subsequently released these accruals as we decided to utilize the north america facility for increased operations and the facility in europe was subleased earlier than assumed in the previous accrual 
we also released a million accrual originally recorded in prior years for a facility in houston  texas as we decided to utilize this facility for increased operations

liquidity and capital resources general our ability to satisfy our debt obligations  fund working capital and make capital expenditures depends upon our future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we achieve significant near term revenue growth  we may experience a need for increased working capital financing as a result of the difference between our cash collection cycles and the timing of our payments to vendors 
historically we have generated cash flow from operations in the first half of the year higher than in the second half of the year reflecting the seasonality of our business 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs primarily ocean and customs duties for which the customer is the primary obligor 
the billings to customers for these disbursements  which are several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions  are not recorded as revenues and expenses on our statement of income  rather  they are reflected in our trade receivables and trade payables 
growth in the level of this activity or lengthening of the period of time between incurring these costs and being reimbursed by our customers for these costs may negatively affect our liquidity 
as primarily a non asset based freight forwarder  we do not have the same level of capital expenditures that would be required of an asset based forwarder 
we believe our anticipated capital expenditures for will be in the range of to million  including approximately to million expected on information systems expenditures 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available borrowing capacity on our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements through december  however  future changes in our business could cause us to consume available resources before that time 
additionally  funds may not be available when needed and even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  and the extent and timing of hiring additional personnel 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all

release of restricted cash 
in february  in response to a joint motion filed by egl and the eeoc  a us district court ordered the return of million to us of million previously held in an established fund to resolve potential claims in connection with a consent decree see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the joint motion and subsequent order resulted in million in income in the first quarter of capital expenditures 
we are in the process of developing and implementing computer system solutions for operational  human resources and financial systems

share repurchase program 
on april   our board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to million in value of our outstanding common stock depending on market conditions and other factors with an expiration date of august  on may   the board of directors approved an increase in the maximum dollar amount of shares to be repurchased from million to million and extended the expiration date to september  as of september   we had repurchased a total of million shares at an average price of per share for approximately million 
on august   the board of directors authorized a modified dutch auction self tender offer to purchase up to  shares up to million of its common stock  representing approximately of its approximately million outstanding shares as of august  the tender offer commenced on tuesday  august  and expired on wednesday  september  in the tender offer  shareholders had the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price not less than per share or more than per share  net to the seller in cash  without interest 
on october   we announced the final results of the tender offer 
an aggregate of  shares were properly tendered and not withdrawn at or below a price of 
because shareholders tendered less than  shares  there was no proration of tendered shares 
we financed the tender offer with the use of cash on hand and borrowings of million under both the new million line of credit facility and the million bridge loan that was refinanced by the issuance of million of floating rate senior secured notes due in october see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we accepted for purchase and paid approximately million for all  shares at a price of per share 
any shares received in the tender offer that were not tendered properly were returned to the tendering shareholders 
the shares purchased pursuant to the tender offer represented approximately of egl s outstanding shares as of september  in february and march  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in value of our outstanding common stock depending on market conditions and other factors

stock options 
as of december   we had outstanding non qualified stock options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the dates of grant prices ranging from to 
at the time a non qualified stock option is exercised  we will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal and state income tax purposes equal to the difference between the fair market value of the common stock on the date of exercise and the option price 
as a result of non qualified stock option exercises in and to purchase an aggregate of million and million shares of common stock  we are entitled to a federal and state income tax deduction of approximately million and million  respectively 
we have recognized a red uction of our federal and state income tax obligations of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
accordingly  we recorded an increase to additional paid in capital and a reduction to current taxes payable 
any exercises of non qualified stock options in the future at exercise prices below the then fair market value of the common stock may also result in tax deductions equal to the difference between those amounts 
there is uncertainty as to whether the exercises will occur  the amount of any deductions  and our ability to fully utilize any tax deductions 
off balance sheet arrangements as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our significant off balance sheet arrangements include liabilities associated with guarantees secured by letters of credit  surety bonds and security time deposits and non cancelable operating leases 
we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing arrangements through special purpose entities 
guarantees 
we guarantee certain financial liabilities  the majority of which relate to our freight forwarding operations 
in the normal course of our business  we are required to guarantee certain amounts related to customs bonds and services received from airlines 
these types of guarantees are usual and customary in the freight forwarding industry 
we operate as a customs broker and prepare and file all formal documentation required for clearance through customs agencies  obtain customs bonds  facilitate the payment of import duties on behalf of the importer and arrange for payment of collect freight charges 
we also assist the importer in obtaining the most advantageous commodity classifications  qualifying for duty drawback refunds and arranges for surety bonds for importers 
we secure these guarantees primarily by three methods a million standby letter of credit sub facility included within our amended and restated credit agreement  surety bonds and security time deposits 
security time deposits are restricted as to withdrawal for a specified timeframe and are classified on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding 
we also issue iata international air transportation association related guarantees  customs bonds and other working capital credit line guarantees in the normal course of business 
iata related guarantees and customs bonds are issued to facilitate the movement and clearance of freight 
working capital credit line guarantees include  but are not limited to  guarantees associated with insurance requirements and certain potential tax obligations 
generally  guarantees have one year or two year terms and are renewed upon expiration 
as of december   total iata related guarantees  customs bonds and other working capital credit line guarantees were approximately million 
approximately million of guarantees  customs bonds and borrowings against credit line guarantees were outstanding  including guarantees of our trade payables and accrued transportation costs and borrowings against our international credit facilities of million  which were recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
leases 
we enter into operating lease agreements  principally for freight operation facilities and office space 
these leases are non cancelable and expire on various dates through certain of our lease agreements contain renewal options and rent escalation clauses 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease payment for use of facilities  rather than purchasing the facilities 
rent expense for operating leases was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which is net of sublease income of million  million and million  respectively 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for more details regarding our outstanding leases

certain relationships and related party transactions aircraft usage payments james r 
crane  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  held interests in two entities one of which is owned and one of which is wholly owned by mr 
crane that lease passenger aircraft to us 
from time to time  our employees use these aircraft in connection with travel associated with our business  for which we make payments to those entities 
during the years ended december  and  we reimbursed mr 
crane million and  respectively  for actual hourly usage of the aircraft 
in january  we purchased from an unrelated third party an aircraft that was previously leased by an entity controlled by mr 
crane for million to be utilized for business travel  eliminating the use of mr 
crane s aircraft and reimbursement thereof 
on july   the compensation committee of the board of directors of egl approved  in lieu of incremental cash compensation  an arrangement to provide mr 
crane  or his designees  with up to an aggregate of hours per year of personal use of our aircraft without reimbursement by mr 
crane 
mr 
crane actually used hours in on march   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the hours of overage and reduced the amount allowed for personal usage in by hours to hours 
we intend to include usage of hours in mr 
crane s taxable income for as required by current us federal income tax regulations 
the us federal income tax regulations also restrict the amount of corporate tax deductions for operating costs and tax depreciation attributable to personal use of the company plane 
the amount of non deductible personal use expense is reduced by the imputed income recognized by the employee 
on august   the board of directors of egl approved  in lieu of additional director cash compensation that would make the existing compensation package more competitive  an arrangement to provide the independent members of the board of directors with limited personal usage of our aircraft  without reimbursement by the directors 
personal usage of the aircraft by the directors is subject to availability  with priority given to our usage  and the cumulative number of hours allowed for all directors may not exceed hours per year 
we will record the number of hours utilized by each director and include in such director s yearly taxable income the amount required by then current us federal income tax regulations 
in  the directors did not utilize the company plane 
shared employees certain of our employees also perform services for companies owned by mr

seasonality historically  our operating results have been subject to a limited degree to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
typically  our first fiscal quarter is weaker when compared to our other fiscal quarters of the corresponding year 
the seasonality of our business is a result of a variety of factors  including holiday seasons  consumer demand  economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors  nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor 
as a result  there can be no assurance that historical patterns  if any  will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate operational and financial accounting policies and controls  and in developing the assumptions that are used in the preparation of these financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
among the factors  but not fully inclusive of all factors that may be considered by management in these processes are the range of accounting policies permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management s understanding of the company s business both historical results and expected future results  expectations of the future performance of the economy domestically  globally and within various sectors that serve our principal customers and suppliers of goods and services  expected rates of change  sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates  and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends 
the estimation process often times may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an amount that lies within that range of reasonable estimates which may result in the selection of estimates that may be viewed as conservative or aggressive by others based upon the quantity  quality and risks associated with the variability that might be expected from the future outcome and the factors considered in developing the estimate 
management attempts to use its business and financial accounting judgment in selecting the most appropriate estimate  however  actual amounts could and will differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition domestic revenues and most domestic operating costs are recognized when shipments are picked up from the customer 
international revenues and freight consolidation costs are recognized in the period when shipments are tendered to a carrier for transport to a foreign destination 
this is one of the permissible methods under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
this method generally results in recognition of revenues and gross profit earlier than methods that do not recognize revenues until a proof of delivery is received 
this method of revenue and cost recognition does not result in a material difference than if revenues and costs were recognized upon delivery 
customs brokerage and other revenues are recognized upon completing the documents necessary for customs clearance or completing other fee based services 
revenues recognized as an indirect air carrier or an ocean freight consolidator include the direct carrier s charges to egl for carrying the shipment 
revenues recognized in other capacities include only the commissions and fees received 
we report the costs of certain reimbursed incidental activities on a gross basis in revenues and cost of transportation 
we derive our revenues from three principal sources air freight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  and customs brokerage  import and logistics services 
air and ocean freight forwarding 
as primarily a non asset based carrier  we do not own transportation assets 
instead  we generate the majority of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and reselling those services to our customers as an indirect carrier 
additionally  we generate air freight and ocean freight forwarding revenues to a lesser extent as an authorized cargo sales agent 
as an indirect carrier  we obtain shipments from our customers  consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination  determine the routing  select the direct carrier and tender each consolidated lot as a single shipment to the direct carrier for transportation to a distribution point 
we issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage 
in turn  when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier  we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for air freight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments 
we are the direct point of contact for service fulfillment and resolving any service failures or claims for lost or damaged freight resulting from either our or the direct carriers actions 
in addition  if we do not collect from our customers  we are still responsible for paying the direct carrier 
due to the high volume of freight we manage  we generally obtain lower rates from the direct carriers than the rates we charge our customers for individual shipments 
this rate differential is the primary source of our air and ocean freight net revenues 
we have complete discretion in selecting the means  route and procedures to be followed in the handling  transportation and delivery of freight 
we select the direct carrier that will provide the most economical routing in an effort to maximize net revenues 
revenues related to shipments where we act as an indirect carrier are reported based on the gross amount billed to the customer and include the charges for carrying the shipments 
based upon the terms in the contract of carriage  revenues are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin 
costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this time 
as an authorized cargo sales agent of most airlines and ocean shipping lines  we also arrange for transportation of individual shipments and receive a commission from the airline or ocean shipping line for arranging the shipments 
when acting in this capacity  we do not consolidate shipments or have responsibility for shipments once they have been tendered to the carrier 
therefore  revenues include only the commissions and fees received 
these revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
customs brokerage and other services 
customs brokerage and import services involve providing services at destinations  such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation  calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery 
we also offer a range of logistics services  distribution and materials management services  international insurance services  global project management services and trade facilitation services 
revenues include the fees received for these services and are recognized upon completion of the services 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors based on the expected ultimate recovery of trade receivables 
we maintain a bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  general and specific economic trends  significant one time events and historical customer collection experience 
also  we record additional reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
trade receivables include disbursements made by us on behalf of our customers for transportation costs and customs duties 
as the billings to customers for these disbursements may be several times the amount of revenues and fees derived from these transactions  the inability to collect such amounts could result in losses greater than the revenues recognized when such billings were recorded 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts would be further adjusted 
computer software certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal use software during the application development stage are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
the following types of costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  ii payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project  iii interest costs incurred in developing software for internal use  and iv costs to develop or obtain software that allows for access or conversion of old data into new systems 
costs related to the preliminary project stage  data conversion and the post implementation operation stage of a software development proje ct are expensed as incurred 
on retirement or sale of assets  the cost of such assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss  if any  is credited or charged to income 
we have incurred substantial costs during the periods presented related to a number of information systems projects that were being developed over that time period 
inherent in the capitalization of those projects are the assumptions that after considering the technological and business issues related to their development  such development efforts will be successfully completed and that benefits to be provided by the completed projects will exceed the costs capitalized to develop the systems 
management believes that all projects capitalized at december  will be successfully completed and will result in benefits recoverable in future periods 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is a residual amount and is determined after numerous estimates are made regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities included in a business combination  and therefore  indirectly affected by management s estimates and judgments 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of est imated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the income approach  which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue  costs  cash flows and capital expenditures  and the timing thereof  appropriate discount rates  tax rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain assumptions to allocate shared assets  liabilities and overhead costs to calculate the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
impairment of assets substantial judgment is necessary in the determination as to whether an event or circumstance has occurred that may trigger an impairment analysis and in determination of the related cash flows from the asset 
estimating cash flows related to long lived assets is a difficult and subjective process that applies historical experience and future business expectations to revenues and related operating costs of assets 
should impairment appear to be necessary  subjective judgment must be applied to estimate the fair value of the asset  for which there may be no ready market  which oftentimes results in the use of discounted cash flow analysis and judgmental selection of discount rates to be used in the discounting process 
if we determine an asset has been impaired based on the projected undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or the business unit over the remaining amortization period  and if the cash flow analysis indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds related undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset or the present value of the expected future cash flows 
merger and restructuring we have engaged in merger and restructuring actions that require our management to utilize significant estimates related to future lease obligations for duplicate facilities  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs and costs for termination of joint venture agency agreements 
management makes significant estimates  including the amount of sublease income we will recover for future lease obligations on duplicate facilities 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could impact our effective tax rate 
we record valuation allowances to reserve deferred tax assets generated from certain jurisdictions 
we consider our historical performance  forecasted taxable income and other factors in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowance 
objective factors such as current year and previous year net operating loss utilization were given more weight than our earnings outlook for future realization of the losses 
we believe we should generate sufficient taxable income to utilize a substantial portion of our net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration 
we also have deferred tax assets for certain foreign and federal tax credits  which management believes will be fully realized in the future based on current year utilization of foreign tax credits and our outlook for future utilization 
in order to realize our deferred tax asset s  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the specific tax jurisdictions to realize the deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
if we later determine or are able to realize the deferred tax assets for the state or foreign net operating losses our valuation allowance could be reversed 
as discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  egl s us federal income tax returns from fiscal years to have been audited by the irs with the case currently at the appeals division for resolution 
the irs has proposed  among other items  to disallow various merger transaction costs and various software research and development expenditures taken as tax deductions 
if the proposed adjustments are upheld  we would be required to pay a total of approximately million in cash taxes  of which approximately million would impact the consolidated statement of income  plus accrued interest of approximately million through december  we are protesting the proposed adjustments to the appeals office of the irs 
we believe our us federal income tax returns were completed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and do not believe material adjustments to our tax returns are probable 
however  there is no assurance that the final outcome will not result in material adjustments which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
other critical accounting policies see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting policies and the judgment made in their application 
new accounting pronouncements we discuss new accounting pronouncements in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash flows and net income are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through operational actions 
we provide services to customers in locations throughout the world and  as a result  operate with many functional currencies including the key currencies of north america  latin america  asia  the south pacific and europe 
this diverse base of local currency costs serves to partially counterbalance the effect of potential changes in the value of our local currency denominated revenues and expenses 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are related primarily to intercompany transactions 
the duration of these exposures is minimized through the use of an intercompany netting and settlement system that settles the majority of inter company obligations two times per month 
we use short term foreign exchange forward contracts on a limited basis to minimize exposures to exchange rates on recorded receivables and payables 
the value of foreign exchange forward contracts was not significant at december  or in october  we issued million of floating rate  senior secured notes due in october the notes have a variable libor based interest rate 
see notes of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding under our line of credit 
our lease payments on certain financed facilities are tied to market interest rates 
at december   a rise in the base rate for these financing arrangements would not have a material impact on operating income in we have not purchased any material futures contracts nor have we purchased or held any material derivative financial instruments for trading purposes during in november  we entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement  which was designated as a cash flow hedge  to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our million of our libor based revolving credit facility or any substitutive debt agreements we enter into 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a loss of  of which  has been recognized as interest expense 
the interest rate swap expires in january
