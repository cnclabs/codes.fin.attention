table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reviews our financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview security bank corporation was incorporated on february  for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company 
we are subject to extensive federal and state banking laws and regulations  including the bank holding company act of and the bank holding company laws of georgia 
we own five subsidiary banks security bank of bibb county  security bank of houston county  security bank of jones county  security bank of north metro and rivoli bank trust 
we also own fairfield financial services  inc  an operating subsidiary of security bank of bibb county 
our subsidiaries are also subject to various federal and state banking laws and regulations 
like most financial institutions  our profitability depends largely upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses  non interest expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits  and occupancy expenses  and non interest income  such as mortgage loan fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
economic conditions  competition and federal monetary and fiscal policies also affect financial institutions 
for example  was characterized by continuing increases in the federal reserve s target federal funds rate to reduce inflationary pressures and  therefore  sustain the pace of economic growth 
lending activities are also influenced by regional and local economic factors  such as housing supply and demand  competition among lenders  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in our primary market area 
our balanced growth continued during  with increases in assets  deposits  shareholders equity  earnings per share and returns on average assets and equity 
the following chart shows our growth in these areas from december  to december  december  december  percent increase dollars in millions  except per share amounts diluted earnings per share total assets loans investment securities deposits shareholders equity return on average assets return on average equity a total increase in loan volume of million  million excluding our acquisitions  resulted from continued strong loan demand in our core markets and was the primary contributor to an increase in net income to million for approximately million of the total increase in deposits of million resulted from our acquisitions 
the remaining million increase in deposits in is the result of intensive marketing 
table of contents efforts aimed at increasing local low cost deposits and funding requirements driven by our loan growth 
we often met these funding needs with out of market deposits  which we can often acquire at targeted maturities to mitigate interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio increased million during excluding our acquisitions  investment securities increased million or  primarily in order to provide on balance sheet liquidity in support of strong loan demand 
the overall level of investment securities declined to of assets at the end of  as compared to of assets at the end of fairfield financial closed over million in residential mortgage loans during and posted approximately million in net income 
approximately of its gross revenue was a product of its traditional residential mortgage origination business  with the remaining being derived from its interim real estate and real estate development lending activities

in connection with the application of those principles  we have made judgments and estimates which  in the case of 
table of contents the determination of our allowance for loan losses all  goodwill and stock based compensation have been critical to the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses all our management assesses the adequacy of the all prior to the end of each calendar quarter 
this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance 
the all consists of two portions an allocated amount representative of specifically identified credit exposure and exposures that are readily predictable by historical or comparative experience  and  an unallocated amount representative of inherent loss that is not readily identifiable 
even though the all is composed of two components  the entire all is available to absorb any credit losses 
we establish the allocated amount separately for three tiers substandard loans with specific allocations based on collateral exposure  loans based on five different credit ratings watch list  other assets specifically mentioned  substandard  doubtful and loss with allocations based on historical losses per rating category  and the rest of the loan portfolio with allocations based on historical losses in the total portfolio 
we base the allocation for unique loans primarily on risk rating grades assigned to each of these loans as a result of our loan management and internal loan review processes 
we then assign each risk rating grade a loss ratio  which is determined based on the experience of management  discussions with banking regulators and our internal loan review process which is maintained at the holding company level 
the unallocated amount is particularly subjective and does not lend itself to exact mathematical calculation 
the unallocated amount represents estimated inherent credit losses  which may exist  but have not yet been identified  as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating the unallocated amount  we apply two stress factors 
the first stress factor consists of economic factors including such matters as changes in the local or national economy  the depth or experience in the lending staff  any concentrations of credit such as commercial real estate in any particular industry group  and new banking laws or regulations 
the second stress factor is based on the credit grade of the loans in our unsecured consumer loan portfolio 
after we assess applicable factors  we evaluate the aggregate unallocated amount based on our management s experience 
we then test the resulting all balance by comparing the balance in the all with historical trends and peer information 
our management then evaluates the result of the procedures performed  including the result of our testing  and makes a conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the balance of the all in its entirety 
the directors loan committee reviews the assessments prior to the filing of quarterly and annual financial information 
in assessing the adequacy of the all  we also rely on an ongoing independent credit administration review process 
we undertake this process both to ascertain whether there are loans in the portfolio whose credit quality has weakened over time and to assist in our overall evaluation of the risk characteristics of the entire loan portfolio 
our credit administration review process includes the judgment of management  the input of our internal loan review function  and reviews that may have been conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their usual examination process 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation management has elected to expense the fair value of stock options 
we utilize the black scholes model in determining the fair value of the stock options 
the model takes into account certain estimated factors such as the expected life of the stock option 
table of contents and the volatility of the stock 
the expected life of the stock option is a function of the vesting period of the grant  the average length of time similar grants have remained outstanding  and the expected volatility of the underlying stock 
volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period 
goodwill effective january   the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets was adopted 
in accordance with this statement  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives no longer are being amortized but will be subject to impairment tests in accordance with the pronouncement 
other intangible assets  primarily core deposits  will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in  the required impairment testing of goodwill was performed and no impairment existed as of the valuation date  as the fair value of our net assets exceeded their carrying value 
if for any future period we determine that there has been impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill balances  we will record a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income

average earning assets used in ratios as follows in thousands   and  compared to net interest income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was attributable to an increase of million  or  in interest income while interest expense only increased million during the net interest rate spread the yield on earning assets minus the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   while the net interest margin net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average earning assets increased basis point from to during the same period 
the decrease in the net interest rate spread in was primarily reflective of a basis point increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  while the yield on earning assets increased basis points 
we experienced significant increases in the costs of all deposits except for savings accounts as our average cost of interest bearing deposits increased to in from in meanwhile  the loan portfolio yield increased basis points as higher yielding fixed rate loans repriced at higher rates and variable rate loans with interest rate floors began to participate fully in rate increases during interest income 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  interest income on loans and investment securities increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average balance of million  of which 
table of contents million was attributable to the inclusion of seven months of loan balances acquired from southbank in may excluding the loan balances acquired from southbank  the million increase in average loans is attributable to continued strong loan growth in our core markets 
interest income on investment securities increased million as a result of an increase of million in average balance for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and an increase of basis point in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
excluding investment securities acquired from southbank  the average balance of investment securities increased million 
the primary reason for the increase in the average balance of investment securities of million was to maintain the level of investment securities as a percent of total assets  so that on balance sheet liquidity would keep pace with loan growth 
at december   investment securities equaled of assets  as compared to at december  overall  the yield on interest earning assets increased basis points from during the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase of million in interest expense on deposits 
excluding seven months of expense resulting from our acquisition of southbank  interest expense increased million and interest expense on deposits increased million 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits  the largest component of interest expense  increased by basis points and the average balance increased by million 
of the million increase in average balances  interest bearing now accounts increased million  money market accounts decreased million and savings accounts increased million 
the increase in the average balance for interest bearing now accounts is primarily due to the introduction of the premium select checking account  which offers a competitive interest rate and the benefits of a traditional checking account 
given the advantages and attractive interest rate offered with the premium select checking account  some of our customers transferred their deposits from our traditional money market account to the premium select checking account 
time deposits  the largest category of deposits  increased million  primarily due to the increase in brokered and internet based cd s to fund loan growth in the fairfield interim lending acquisition and development division 
the interest expense on borrowed funds in increased by million or when compared to this increase was caused by an increase of million or in the average balance of borrowed funds combined with an increase of basis points to in the average costs of borrowings 
compared to net interest income 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was attributable to an increase of million  or  in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest rate spread the yield on earning assets minus the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   while the net interest margin net interest income on a tax equivalent basis divided by average earning assets increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest rate spread and net interest rate margin in was primarily reflective of a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  while the yield on earning assets declined basis points 
although the average cost of interest bearing demand deposits and money market accounts was virtually unchanged  we were able to significantly reduce the costs of time deposits as longer term  higher rate time deposits matured in a lower rate environment and we were able to reprice the renewals at lower 
table of contents rates 
new time deposit money raised in the lower rate environment also reduced the weighted average cost of the total time deposit portfolio 
meanwhile  the loan portfolio yield declined basis points as higher yielding fixed rate loans repriced at lower rates and variable rate loans with interest rate floors did not participate fully in rate increases in the second half of interest income 
interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  interest income on loans and investment securities increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest income on loans for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in average balance of million  of which million was attributable to including in a full year of loan balances acquired from security bank of jones county in may the year ended december  included months of these balances 
interest income on investment securities increased million as a result of an increase of million in average balance for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and an increase of basis points in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
the primary reason for the increase in the average balance of investment securities of million was to maintain the level of investment securities as a percent of total assets  so that on balance sheet liquidity would keep pace with loan growth 
at december   investment securities equaled of assets  as compared to at december  overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended december  to for the year ended december  interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense resulted primarily from an increase of million in interest expense on deposits 
the average cost of interest bearing deposits  the largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points and the average balance increased by million 
of the million increase in average balances  interest bearing accounts increased million  money market accounts increased million and savings accounts increased million  primarily as a result of our increased marketing efforts to bring in low cost deposits 
time deposits  the largest category of deposits  increased million  primarily due to the increase in brokered and internet based cd s to fund loan growth in the fairfield interim lending acquisition and development division 
the interest expense on borrowed funds in was relatively unchanged when compared to a decline in the average balance in borrowed funds of million was offset by an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds of basis points  which resulted in a net increase in the cost of other borrowings of  when comparing to

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings taken to increase the allowance for loan losses 
the general nature of lending results in periodic charge offs of non performing loans  in spite of our continuous loan review process  credit standards  and internal controls 
during and  we factored into our provision for loan losses a subjective assessment of the economic downturn s effect on the cash flow of some of our borrowers 
we expensed million in  in  and million in for loan loss provisions 
the slight decrease in the provision for loan losses in was primarily due to a low level of net charge offs as compared to the company s five year average of net charge offs 
our net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were in  in  and in the level of net charge offs to average loans of was low compared to the five year average of 
amounts of net loans charged off during recent years are reasonable by industry standards and are below peer group institutions of similar asset size 
we incurred net charge offs of million in  compared to million during  and million during the allowance for loan losses on december  stood at of outstanding net loans and loans held for sale  down from at december  and at december  non interest income non interest income of million in represented an increase of or million from million recorded in service charges on deposit accounts  which constitute of non interest income  are the largest component of non interest income  generating million for  up from million in service charges on deposit accounts  which are primarily fees generated from our courtesy overdraft protection product  accounted for million  or of all service charges 
the courtesy overdraft product completed its fourth full year in  but its growth was enhanced by the success of the high performance checking program 
the increase in fees from our courtesy overdraft product is also attributable to the significant growth in deposits during the year of million or  excluding the impact of the southbank and rivoli bancorp acquisitions 
the second largest component of non interest income is mortgage banking income  which constituted of non interest income during mortgage banking income decreased  from million in to million in the decrease in mortgage banking income is attributable to the slow down in the refinance market resulting from increasing interest rates 
this decline was offset by commissions and fees generated by fairfield financial s interim lending division 
commissions and fees increased to million over amounts reported in non interest expense non interest expense was million for the year ended  up or million  from million in salaries and benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  constituting of non interest expense  increased million to million in from million in approximately million of the increase in salaries and benefits is related to the hiring of approximately twenty employees in connection with the acquisition of southbank 
the remainder of the increase is due to normal salary and benefit increases from merit increases and the hiring of new employees 
all other operating overhead increased by million or during excluding southbank s operating results for the seven months ended december   other operating overhead increased approximately  or 
the primary increases were due to the fees associated with and expenses incurred by the company in connection with the acquisitions of southbank and rivoli bancorp as well as increases in directors fees and audit and accounting fees primarily attributable to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of income tax expense our consolidated federal and state income tax expense increased to million in  up from million in and million in the effective tax rate was   and in  and

nonaccrual loans are those loans on which recognition of interest income has been discontinued 
restructured loans generally allow for an extension of the original repayment period or a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
loans  whether secured or unsecured  are generally placed on nonaccrual status when principal and or interest is days or more past due  or sooner if it is known or expected that the collection of all principal and or interest is unlikely 
other real estate owned is initially recorded at the lower of cost or estimated market value at the date of acquisition 
a provision for estimated losses is recorded when a subsequent decline in value occurs 
nonperforming assets at december  amounted to approximately million  or of total loans and other real estate 
this compares to approximately million in nonperforming assets or of total loans and other real estate at december  nonperforming assets at december  amounted to approximately million  which is essentially unchanged from the level at december  however  the level of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate at december  was down to from at december  the following table sets forth our nonaccrual  restructured and past due loans  along with other real estate owned at the end of the past five years  and the amount of interest foregone in on our nonperforming assets

at december  and december   there were no other loans classified for regulatory purposes as loss or doubtful that are not included in the table above  but there were other loans classified for regulatory purposes as substandard or special mention that are not included in the table above 
however  management is aware of no such substandard or special mention loans not included above which i represent or result from trends or uncertainties which management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or ii represent material credits about which any information causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
we have no loans in our portfolio to borrowers in foreign countries 
loan concentrations exist when large amounts of money are loaned to multiple borrowers who would be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
the loan portfolio is concentrated in various commercial  real estate and consumer loans to individuals and entities located in middle georgia  and to a lesser extent northern metropolitan atlanta and glynn county and in other georgia markets where fairfield financial operates loan offices 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate 
these loans are well collateralized and  in management s opinion  do not pose an unacceptable level of credit risk 
the company does make speculative loans to borrowers in that the collateral property has not been pre sold or pre leased 
while these loans are inherently riskier due to the fact that the borrower may not be able to sell or lease the property as intended  the company only makes these loans to established customers with a good history of prior developments 
at december   the company had outstanding speculative loans of approximately million 
the largest components of our loan portfolio are the construction and land development loans and mortgage loans secured by nonfarm  nonresidential properties 
real estate construction and development loans  which are of the loan portfolio  are made to finance land development and residential and commercial construction 
mortgage loans secured by nonfarm  nonresidential properties  which are of the portfolio  are loans made to finance the purchase or development of commercial properties such as hotels  motels  shopping centers  timber holdings  office buildings and convenience stores 
of the total  the largest collateral types are retail facilities and office facilities 
we have no other interest bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed as nonperforming assets if they were loans 

table of contents summary of loan loss experience the following table summarizes loans charged off  recoveries of loans previously charged off and additions to the allowance for loan losses that have been charged to operating expense ie provisions for loan losses for the periods indicated

the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be transferred to the allowance for loan losses to maintain a level that it considers adequate in relation to the risk of future losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
it is the policy of our subsidiary banks to provide for exposure to losses principally through an ongoing loan review process 
this review process is undertaken to ascertain any probable losses that must be charged off and to assess the risk characteristics of individually significant loans and of the portfolio in the aggregate 
this review takes into consideration the judgments of the responsible lending officers and the loan committees of our subsidiary banks boards of directors  and also those of the regulatory 
table of contents agencies that review the loans as part of their regular examination process 
during routine examinations of banks  the primary banking regulators may  from time to time  require additions to banks provisions for loan losses and allowances for loan losses if the regulators credit evaluations differ from those of management 
in addition to ongoing internal loan reviews and risk assessment  management uses other factors to judge the adequacy of the allowance  including current economic conditions  loan loss experience  regulatory guidelines and current levels of non performing loans 
management believes that the balances of million and million in the allowance for loan losses at december  and  respectively  were adequate to absorb known risks in the loan portfolio at those dates 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in our loan portfolio or that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb such unexpected losses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  management  considering current information and events regarding the borrowers ability to repay their obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan becomes impaired  management calculates the impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment and any subsequent changes are recorded  through a charge to earnings  as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
when management considers a loan  or a portion thereof  as uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
an allocation of the allowance for loan losses has been made to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional allowance amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the allowance for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table shows a five year comparison of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses based on loan categories

table of contents investment portfolio the investment securities portfolio is another major interest earning asset and consists of debt and equity securities categorized as either available for sale or held to maturity 
given our strong loan demand  the investment portfolio is viewed primarily as a source of liquidity  with yield as a secondary consideration

table of contents borrowed funds our interest bearing sources of borrowed funds at december  totaled million 
the major component was million in various advances from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb 
we borrow from the fhlb under two separate programs 
our first program is a blanket agreement for advances and security agreement with the fhlb  under which our banks have pledged residential first mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans and investment securities as collateral to secure available lines of credit totaling million 
at december   our lendable collateral value  which represents approximately of eligible collateral was million  million of which was available 
these advances have maturities in varying amounts through march and interest rates ranging from to

in connection with our acquisitions of southbank and rivoli bancorp  we assumed million in fhlb advances with maturities ranging from to for  fhlb advances averaged million with an average interest cost of we have a revolving line of credit with the bankers bank in atlanta  georgia totaling million 
the line is secured with the common stock of security bank of bibb county and indirectly the stock of fairfield financial as its subsidiary  security bank of houston county and security bank of jones county as collateral  and carries a floating interest rate of prime minus basis points on million and prime minus basis points on million 
we use the revolving line of credit primarily to provide capital injections as necessary to our subsidiary banks 
at december  and  the outstanding balance on the revolving line of credit was zero 
the maximum aggregate indebtedness on the line during was million  which was paid using the proceeds from our issuance of million in trust preferred securities in december per an agreement with the federal reserve bank of atlanta  we may not draw more than million on the line without prior approval 
the average balance of debt under the bankers bank line of credit for the year was million at an average rate of 
for  the average balance was million at a cost of 
as a result of our acquisition of rivoli bancorp in december  we assumed a line of credit for million with a correspondent bank 
the line of credit matures on march  and interest is payable quarterly based on the prime rate 
the balance on this note payable at december  was million 
during the fourth quarter of  we formed statutory trust i  a delaware statutory trust subsidiary whose purpose was to issue million in trust preferred securities through a pool sponsored by ftn financial capital markets 
to support the trust preferred securities issued by the trust  we issued a like amount of junior subordinated debentures to the trust  which the trust purchased from us using proceeds from its sale of the trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures pay interest at a floating annual rate  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor rate plus  which rate equaled at december  we used the proceeds from the offering to retire holding company debt and to fund our acquisition of security bank of jones county 

in december  we formed another delaware statutory trust subsidiary  statutory trust ii  that issued an additional million in trust preferred securities through a pool sponsored by ftn financial capital markets 
to support the trust preferred securities issued by the trust  we issued a like amount of junior subordinated debentures to the trust  which the trust purchased from us using proceeds from its sale of the trust preferred securities 
we used the proceeds from the offering to pay off our line of credit with the bankers bank and to fund the acquisition of the rivoli bancorp 
the trust preferred securities issued by the trust in  and the junior subordinated debentures we issued to the trust in connection with that offering  bear a fixed rate of interest equal to annually for the first five years and a floating rate of interest  reset quarterly  equal to the three month libor rate plus annually thereafter 
in each case  the trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures issued by us have a maturity of years and are redeemable after five years  subject to certain conditions and limitations

table of contents capital resources and dividends we place an emphasis on maintaining an adequate capital base to support our activities in a safe manner while at the same time maximizing shareholder returns 
we continue to exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements as shown in the table below 
our equity capital of million at december  amounts to of total assets  compared to at december   and at december  on average  our equity capital was of assets during  compared to for and for the increase in the capital ratios in was primarily due to our issuance of approximately million in new equity capital in connection with the acquisitions of southbank and rivoli bancorp 
in june  our common stock was added to the russell index  recognizing us as one of the largest  publicly traded companies in the us in terms of market capitalization 
our market capitalization increased from million at the end of to million at the end of  an increase of 
the increase in market capitalization was primarily due to the issuance of common stock discussed above  as well as  an increase of per share  or  in our common stock price from december  to december  principal uses of our capital base in recent years have been sustaining the capital adequacy of our subsidiaries as they continue to grow at a steady pace  expanding our presence in middle georgia with more physical locations and improved delivery systems  expanding into contiguous houston county through our acquisition of crossroads bank of georgia security bank of houston county and developing a mortgage loan division  acquiring fairfield financial to broaden and expand our mortgage services markets with new management talent and more physical locations throughout georgia  expanding into jones county through our acquisition of the bank of gray security bank of jones county  enhancing corporate infrastructure systems to support our multi bank environment  opening de novo branches in glynn county in and  expanding into northern metropolitan atlanta through our acquisition of southbank security bank of north metro  and expanding our presence in middle georgia through our acquisition of rivoli bancorp 
potential uses of our capital base could include future acquisitions and de novo branches 
current regulatory standards require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum risk based capital ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  with at least of the capital consisting of tier capital  and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
additionally  the regulatory agencies define a well capitalized bank as one that has a tier leverage ratio of at least  a tier capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
as of december   we had a tier leverage ratio of  a tier capital ratio of  and a total risk based capital ratio of  and were therefore well capitalized according to all regulatory guidelines 
maintaining these capital levels is crucial to our growth strategy  because the federal reserve bank of atlanta has indicated that it will not approve any future acquisition whereby the resulting combined company is not well capitalized at the holding company level

since the commencement of cash dividend payments in  our board of directors has consistently declared and paid dividends on a quarterly basis 
as of december   million of junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities was classified as tier capital under federal reserve board guidelines 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities represent a minority investment in a consolidated subsidiary  which is currently included in tier capital  so long as it does not exceed of total tier capital 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin and revised amendment to fin  however  the trust subsidiary must be deconsolidated for accounting purposes 
the federal reserve recently adopted amendments to its capital adequacy rules that explicitly deduct goodwill and intangibles from equity in determining the amount of trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements that can be included in tier capital 
liquidity primarily through the actions of our subsidiary banks  we engage in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals  credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds 
liquidity needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income  and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in 
table of contents addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits  the renewal of maturing deposits  and external borrowings 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits as needed 
to the extent needed to fund loan demand  traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits  and other wholesale deposit sources outside our immediate market area  including an internet based national cd service 
management has found that most non relationship oriented retail cds are interchangeable with wholesale funding sources such as brokered deposits and national market cds and alternates between these sources depending on the relative cost 
our asset liability management committee meets weekly to discuss liquidity related issues such as loan pipelines  deposit pricing and upcoming deposit maturities  among others 
through various asset liability management strategies  we maintain a balance among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
our subsidiary banks monitor internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines 
the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   we held million in bonds excluding restricted stock at current market value in our available for sale portfolio 
we purchase only marketable investment grade bonds 
although a portion of our bond portfolio is encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes  management can restructure and free up investment securities for sale if required to meet liquidity needs 
at december   approximately million  or  of our available for sale investment portfolio was pledged to secure deposits  repurchase agreements and for other related purposes 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as our primary funding source 
the stability of our core deposit base is an important factor in our liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
at december  and  our subsidiary banks had million and million  respectively  in certificates of deposit of  or more 
these larger deposits represented and of respective total interest bearing deposits 
management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates  which tend to be more volatile in nature  to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed 
relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize our overall cost of funds 
our local market deposit sources have not been sufficient to fund the strong loan growth trends of fairfield financial over the past five years 
our banks supplemented deposit sources with brokered deposits and internet based cds 
as of december  the banks reported million  or of total deposits  in brokered certificates of deposit attracted by external third parties with a weighted average rate of 
additionally  the banks use external wholesale or internet services to obtain out of market certificates of deposits at competitive interest rates when funding is needed 
as of december   the banks reported million in wholesale cds  representing of total deposits and carrying a weighted average rate of at year end 
to plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out of market deposit balances  we have established multiple borrowing sources to augment our funds management 
at the holding company level  we have an unsecured line of credit  and borrowing capacity also exists through the membership of our subsidiary banks in the federal home loan bank program 
at december  we had  at the holding company level  a million revolving line of credit with the bankers bank  with zero outstanding at year end 
this line of credit is secured by the common stock of three of our subsidiary banks and indirectly  the stock of fairfield financial 
based on the collateral value of assets pledged to the federal home loan bank at december  under our two programs for advances  our subsidiary banks had total borrowing capacity of up to million  of which million was drawn and outstanding at year end 
our subsidiary banks have also established overnight borrowing lines for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks that 
table of contents collectively amounted to million in capacity at december  approximately million of our federal funds lines were in use at year end 
management believes that the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet our liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
interest rate risk management we have successfully managed the level of our net interest margin since  despite the pressure on our net interest margin from a low interest rate environment that has evolved into a moderate rate environment with a flattening yield curve 
our net interest margin was in  in  in and in since we have aggressively worked to lower deposit costs to offset lower yields from the loan portfolio 
as noted above  we have been successful in generating low cost transaction accounts  as well as selectively alternating between retail cds  borrowed funds and internet brokered cds to generate the lowest cost funding sources available 
to help us manage fluctuations in our net interest income  we use simulation modeling to estimate the impact on net interest income of both the current level of market interest rates and for changes to the current level of market interest rates 
we measure the projected changes in market interest rates in terms of rate shifts of plus or minus  and basis points over the current levels of market interest rates 
we assume rate shifts occur ratably over a month measurement horizon 
we then use a new set of market interest rates to derive pricing for maturing or repricing assets and liabilities 
we base projected pricing for maturing and repricing assets and liabilities upon market interest rates and actual pricing experience over the period immediately preceding the projection period 
using the current level of market interest rates at december  and using actual pricing experience immediately preceding the projection  our simulation model projects a net interest margin of for the twelve month period ending december  this compares to a net interest margin of for the year ended december  assuming a basis point rise in rates over year end market levels  the net interest margin is projected to be for the month horizon 
the net interest margin is projected to be and for a and basis point rise in rates  respectively  over the same measurement period 
the net interest margin is projected to be  and for a  and basis point fall in rates  respectively 
our interest rate risk profile shows a fairly balanced position for both rising and falling rates  with our balance sheet as of december  being slightly asset sensitive 
the consensus blue chip economic forecast at december   called for a slight increase in both short term and long term rates  thereby maintaining a relatively flat yield curve 
rates are expected to reach a peak during and then remain flat for several months 
accordingly  we are closely monitoring the estimated effects of these forecasted rates 
we also use a cumulative gap analysis model that seeks to measure the repricing differentials  or gap  between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time horizons 
the following table reflects the gap positions of our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and at various repricing intervals 
this gap analysis indicates that we had a slightly asset sensitive balance sheet over a one year time horizon at december  and  with cumulative rate sensitive assets amounting to of cumulative rate sensitive liabilities 
at december   our balance sheet was slightly asset sensitive over a one year time horizon  with rate sensitive assets amounting to of rate sensitive liabilities 
the projected deposit repricing volumes reflect adjustments based on management s assumptions of the expected rate sensitivity to current market rates for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts 
adjustments are also made for callable investment securities in the bond portfolio to place these bonds in call date categories 
management believes that our current degree of interest rate risk is acceptable in the current interest rate environment

the line of credit was assumed in connection with the acquisition of rivoli bancorp 
the million of subordinated debentures above relate to our trust preferred securities  which were issued or assumed in and the proceeds of the trust preferred securities were used to pay down holding company debt  and to fund the acquisitions of security bank of jones county and rivoli bancorp 
other bank facilities are leased under operating leases included in the table above 
deferred compensation plans are maintained by two of our subsidiary banks 
these plans are for specific officers to defer current compensation until termination  retirement  death or an unforeseeable emergency 
the contracts were initially funded through the purchase of life insurance policies 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by a bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
a commitment involves  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party to the instrument is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument 
because certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral held for commitments to extend credit varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant  equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
the following table summarizes our off balance sheet financial instruments whose contract amounts represented credit risk as of december  standby and performance letters of credit unfulfilled loan commitments no losses are anticipated as a result of the commitments and we do not feel that they are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition 
after the initial commitment to extend credit has been made  we may receive a letter of credit fee or loan origination fee  but do not typically receive any further revenues or incur any additional expenses on the unfulfilled commitments 
inflation inflation impacts our financial condition and operating results 
however  because most of the assets of the bank subsidiaries are monetary in nature  the effect is less significant compared to other commercial or industrial companies with heavy investments in inventories and fixed assets 
inflation influences the growth of total banking assets  which in turn produces a need for an increased equity capital base to support growing banks 
inflation also influences interest rates and tends to raise the general level of salaries  operating costs and purchased services 
our mortgage division is particularly impacted by swings in the interest rate cycle 
we have not attempted to measure the effect of inflation on various types of income and expense due to difficulties in quantifying the impact 
management s awareness of inflationary effects has led to various operational strategies to cope with its impact 
we engage in various asset liability management strategies to control interest rate sensitivity and minimize exposure to interest rate risk 
prices for banking products and services are continually reviewed in relation to current costs  and overhead cost cutting is an ongoing task
