the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of staar  including the related notes  provided in this report 
overview strategy staar is currently focusing on the following four strategic goals successfully launching the icl in the us market and securing us approval of the ticl  generating further growth of the icl and ticl in international markets  reversing the decline in us market share for our core cataract product lines by renewing and refining our product offering through enhanced r d  and maintaining our focus on regulatory compliance and continuous quality improvement 
successfully launching the icl in the us market and securing us approval of the ticl 
staar s visian icl is the first implantable lens to be sold for the correction of myopia in the us that is foldable  and therefore minimally invasive 
us surgeons who had developed expertise in implanting the icl during our clinical trials began implanting the icl in new patients on january   and staar began its pre launch in a rollout to qualify icl surgeons on january  staar makes the icl available to selected surgeons only after completion of a training program that includes proctoring of selected supervised surgeries 
staar believes that this carefully guided method of product release is essential to help ensure the consistent quality of patient outcomes and the high levels of patient satisfaction needed to establish wide acceptance of the icl as a choice for refractive surgery 
in international markets  this approach has resulted in relatively slow but steady and sustained growth in sales over the last few years 
staar believes that the ticl  a variant of the icl that corrects both astigmatism and myopia in a single lens  also has a significant potential market in the us securing fda approval of the ticl is therefore an integral part of staar s strategy to develop its us refractive market 
because the application for fda approval of the ticl is considered a supplement to the pre market application for the icl  it could not be submitted until after approval of the icl was granted 
staar has completed clinical trials for the ticl and intends to submit its application for us approval of the ticl around the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of generating further growth of the icl and ticl in international markets 
in markets where the icl and ticl have been approved  staar has gradually increased its share of the refractive implant market and of the overall market for refractive surgery 
staar has principally emphasized the superior visual outcomes the icl 
table of contents can provide in patients who fall outside the ideal range for lasik surgery and similar procedures 
staar believes that when surgeons using the icl for those patients become accustomed to the predictable  superior outcomes of the icl  they may begin offering it to a broader range of patients as an alternative to cornea based procedures 
staar bases this belief on the fact that in most markets  over time  the sales of mid powered icls increases as a proportion of total sales 
when surgeons and patients choose the icl for lower levels of correction  the size of its potential market increases greatly 
in addition  the introduction of the ticl in international markets has strengthened our refractive offering and contributed to accelerated sales growth for both the icl and ticl 
because it is designed to provide a customized solution for a wide array of refractive errors  the ticl is made in numerous powers and must be custom ordered 
the time required to fill orders has been a challenge to staar in marketing the ticl 
staar has recently been able to commit to more rapidly delivery of the ticl  which has allowed us to win market share from other phakic implants 
staar believes that for a large number of patients with both myopia and astigmatism the ticl can provide an outcome that is superior to that of any other surgical procedure 
when measured six months after surgery  approximately of the patients receiving the ticl have shown better visual acuity than the best they previously achieved with glasses or contact lenses 
staar continues to seek new approvals for the icl and ticl in other countries 
during the second quarter of  staar received market approvals for the ticl in canada and korea and for both the icl and ticl in singapore 
staar believes it could obtain approval for the icl and ticl in china around the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of reversing the decline in us market share for our core cataract product lines by intensifying selling efforts and renewing and refining our product offering through enhanced r d 
staar pioneered the foldable iol for use in cataract surgery 
sales of iols and other cataract related products still make up of staar s total revenue 
however  over the last several years staar has experienced declining us sales of iols 
staar seeks to reverse the decline in its domestic cataract market share by intensifying its selling efforts in the improved environment resulting from icl approval 
in addition  the resolution of fda compliance issues has enabled staar to shift r d resources to developing improved cataract products intended to help reverse the decline 
staar s management believes that the erosion staar s us cataract market share principally resulted from our sales representatives lack of effective selling time with our target surgeon market 
in recent periods  our independent sales representatives have had difficulty obtaining selling time with receptive surgeons because of two factors lack of improved or innovative products to introduce  and negative publicity resulting from fda compliance issues and past concerns about staar s financial stability 
a more detailed discussion of these problems is provided under the caption recent highlights decline in us sales of iol below 
management believes that approval of the icl in the us and the resolution of staar s issues with the fda office of compliance have improved the sales environment for staar s cataract products as well 
staar has developed a combined sales incentive plan for its independent representatives  which is intended to capitalize on the interest in the icl among ophthalmologists by encouraging intensified selling efforts in our cataract product line along with the sales of the icl 
accomplishing us icl approval and resolving fda compliance issues has also enabled staar to shift its r d resources to the initiative to renew and revamp its cataract product offering 
the first product offering from this effort is a redesigned three piece collamer iol and a newly designed delivery system  which we introduced to the us market in while the outcome of r d is never certain  staar s management believes that its investments in cataract technology in fiscal may yield further improved and enhanced products that will generate greater sales interest 
to reverse the decline in us iol sales  staar must overcome several short and long term challenges 
in particular  overcoming reputational harm will take time 
we cannot ensure that this strategy will ultimately be successful 
maintaining our focus on regulatory compliance and continuous quality improvement 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  staar s manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to regulation by the fda 
failure to demonstrate compliance with fda regulations can result in enforcement actions that terminate  suspend 
table of contents or severely restrict the ability to continue manufacturing and selling medical devices 
between december  and july  staar received warning letters  form inspectional observations and other correspondence from the fda indicating deficiencies in staar s compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations and warning of possible enforcement action 
in response  staar implemented numerous improvements to its quality system 
among other things  staar developed a global quality systems action plan  which has been continuously updated since its adoption in april   and took steps to emphasize a focus on compliance throughout the organization 
based on the results of the fda s most recent inspection of staar s monrovia  california facility between august  and september  and the fda s final approval of the visian icl  staar believes that it is substantially in compliance with the fda s quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations 
nevertheless  the fda s findings of compliance deficiencies have harmed our reputation in the ophthalmic industry and affected our product sales  and likely resulted in a significant delay in fda approval of the icl 
staar s ability to continue its us business depends on the continuous improvement of its quality systems and its ability to demonstrate compliance with fda regulations 
accordingly  for the foreseeable future staar s management expects its strategy to include devoting significant resources and attention to strict regulatory compliance and continuous improvement in quality 
financing strategy while staar s international business generates positive cash flow and of staar s revenue  staar has reported losses on a consolidated basis for each of the last three fiscal years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
during the last three years staar has secured additional capital to sustain operations through private sales of equity securities 
staar s management believes that in the near term its best prospect for returning its us and consolidated operations to profitability is the successful launch of the icl in the us in the longer term staar seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
nevertheless  success of these strategies is not assured and  even if successful  staar is not likely to achieve positive cash flow on a consolidated basis during fiscal to avoid  if possible  additional rounds of equity financing and potential dilution to the interests of existing stockholders  staar plans to finance its operations  including the us launch of the icl  through funds from operations and existing cash resources 
staar is also seeking a line of credit through a us bank  and its swiss subsidiary has  in borrowing availability under its million line of credit for use in swiss operations 
staar s cash resources are discussed in further detail under the caption liquidity and capital resources below 
to maximize the effective use of its cash resources  staar implemented a number of cost reduction strategies beginning in the fourth quarter of for the full year  the company used approximately  for operating activities  which is below the company s cash usage of  for the success of staar s financing strategy is not assured and is subject to numerous contingencies and risks  including those discussed under item a 
risk factors 
staar may find it necessary to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of equity securities  but staar has only million shares of common stock authorized for issuance as of december   that have not already been issued or reserved for issuance on the exercise of outstanding options 
to address this issue  staar s board of directors adopted a resolution to submit a proposal to the stockholders at the annual meeting to increase staar s authorized shares of common stock 
staar has limited access to financing  and if its funds from operations  cash and access to borrowing are not sufficient to support operations staar may not be able to secure financing on favorable terms or at all 
recent highlights decline in us sales of iols 
several factors led to a decline in total us sales during  from million to million 
staar s management believes that  above all  the decline has resulted from our sales representatives lack of effective selling time with our target surgeon market 
our independent 
table of contents sales representatives have had difficulty obtaining selling time with receptive surgeons because of two factors negative publicity resulting from fda compliance issues and past concerns about staar s financial stability  and a lack of improved or innovative products to introduce 
in a number of documents  including form observations  warning letters  and in particular a letter received from the fda on july   the fda found staar to be in violation of provisions of the fda s quality system regulation and medical device reporting regulations and indicated that regulatory action against staar was possible 
staar believes the issues raised by the fda were resolved by the fourth quarter of  and believes it is substantially in compliance with fda regulations 
nevertheless  negative publicity surrounding the fda proceedings damaged staar s quality reputation with customers and led to doubts about staar s ability to continue its domestic business 
in addition  in their original report on the company s audited financial statements for fiscal year  the company s independent registered public accounting firm included a qualifying paragraph expressing substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
while this qualification was withdrawn following the company s receipt of the proceeds of a private placement of common stock on april   doubt about the company s ability to continue to support its products caused some customers to curtail purchases of our products 
the uncertainty created by the above factors worsened a sales environment that was already difficult because of staar s failure in recent years to match the pace of its competitors in improving iol technology and standard lens delivery systems 
the slow pace of improvements  in turn  resulted from staar s need to invest in developing and commercializing its icl technology and in revamping its quality systems  which left limited resources for developing new and enhanced lenses and injector systems for cataract treatment 
staar has introduced some innovative products during this period  including iols made of the same uniquely biocompatible collamer material used in the icl and the first preloaded injector system  which was developed by staar s joint venture company in japan  canon staar 
however  the preloaded injector is not yet approved for sale in the us and these products did not significantly increase surgeons receptiveness to our representatives selling efforts 
the poor sales environment has severely hampered our representatives ability to gain selling time to generate new business and preserve our existing domestic business 
as discussed above under the caption strategy reversing the decline in us market share for our core cataract product lines by intensifying selling efforts and renewing and refining our product offering through enhanced r d  staar believes that the us launch of the icl and the recent resolution of compliance issues with the fda have provided on opportunity to gain selling time for our representatives in a more favorable sales environment 
staar introduced the redesigned three piece collamer iol and newly designed delivery system to the us market in sales of this lens have been encouraging  comprising approximately of staar s total us iol sales in the fourth quarter of sales in the third and fourth quarters were also affected by a ruling of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
the ruling permits medicare covered cataract patients to receive higher cost multifocal iols by paying only the additional cost of the lens and surgical procedure while still receiving reimbursement for the basic cost of cataract surgery and a monofocal iol 
surgeons who wished to offer this alternative to patients  including most of staar s customers  by use of alcon s restor lens  were required to implant an alcon monofocal iol in at least thirty patients as a pre requisite to training in implanting the restor lens 
this generally resulted in the surgeon implanting sixty of our competitor s lenses in order to use the same lens in each of the patients eyes  and as a consequence  staar likely lost significant sales 
while staar expects some rebound in sales  the cms ruling and the ability of surgeons to offer multifocal lenses with partial medicare reimbursement is expected to continue to affect sales of staar s iols in future periods 
growth in international sales of visian icls and preloaded silicone iols 
the decline in the us cataract business during was offset in part by a increase in international sales of the visian icl and ticl 
in addition  the preloaded silicone iol injector system developed with our joint venture partner canon 
table of contents staar experienced strong sales in international markets  growing for the year 
this growth in the business contributed to an increase in international sales of for fiscal compared with seasonality 
we generally experience lower sales during the third quarter due to the effect of summer vacations on elective procedures 
in particular  because sales activity in europe drops dramatically in the summer months  and european sales have recently accounted for a greater proportion of our total sales  this seasonal variation in our results has become even more pronounced 
foreign currency fluctuations 
our products are sold in approximately countries 
during fiscal year  sales from international operations represented of total sales 
the results of operations and the financial position of certain of our offshore operations are reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements  exposing us to currency translation risk 
for fiscal year  changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales and marketing and selling expenses 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin decreased to for fiscal year  compared with in the decline in gross profit from generally resulted from higher unit costs as a result of manufacturing process changes and reduced volume  and a shift in geographical and product mix 
the company expects the us launch of the icl  with its higher margins  to improve gross profit 
research and development 
we spent approximately of our sales on research and development which includes regulatory and quality assurance expenses during fiscal  and we expect to spend approximately of our sales on an annual basis in the future 
private placements 
due to the delay in the fda approval of the icl  we sought additional cash to invest in research and development  regulatory and compliance  and manufacturing engineering and to support other operating activities 
this was accomplished through the private placement of  shares of our common stock on april   which generated net proceeds of million and  shares of our common stock on june   which generated net proceeds of million 
cash flow 
the company used approximately million for operating activities during fiscal  which is below the company s cash usage of million during fiscal during the fourth quarter of  we took steps to reduce operating expenses by reducing our reliance on outside consultants 
this reduction in spending resulted in savings of approximately million 
in early february  we implemented additional cost reduction strategies  including the reduction in size of our direct sales force  which resulted in another  in annualized cost savings 
use of cash for the fourth quarter of was below that in the fourth quarter of we will continue to pursue other cost savings opportunities  wherever possible  to conserve cash 
the company expects to reverse its operating losses and negative cash flows as icl sales reach targeted levels for retention of morgan stanley 
in december we engaged morgan stanley to assist our board of directors in a review of the strategic and financial options available to us 
litigation 
the company and its chief executive officer are defendants in a class action lawsuit pending in the central district of california on behalf of all persons who purchased the company s securities during various periods of and on december   a joint status report and notice of settlement was filed with the central district of california  indicating that the parties to the lawsuit had reached an agreement in principal to settle on all claims 
a stipulation of settlement is currently being negotiated by the parties 
until the parties agree to the stipulation settlement and it is finally approved by the court the case will remain pending

net sales for the years ended december  fiscal and december  fiscal were million and million  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on net sales for fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in product sales was a decrease in us cataract product sales  both in average selling prices and volumes  due to i increasing concerns in the marketplace regarding the company s long unresolved compliance issues with the fda  ii the company s failure to match competitors improvements to iol technology  iii although subsequently withdrawn  the receipt of a going concern qualification from the company s auditors  iv our sales representatives loss of effective selling time as a result of the foregoing  v a supplier recall of viscoelastic which is often bundled with iols  and vi the cms ruling that permits medicare covered cataract patients to receive higher cost multifocal iols by paying only the additional cost of the lens and surgical procedure while still receiving reimbursement for the basic cost of cataract surgery and a monofocal iol 
the decreases in us cataract product sales were partially offset by a increase in sales of the company s visian tm icl icl and visian tm toric icl ticl in international markets  and an increase in sales of preloaded iols in international markets 
gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to of revenues for fiscal  from of revenues for fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease in gross profit margin were higher unit costs due to the allocation of fixed overhead across fewer units produced  lower overall average selling prices of iols  and a continued shift in geographical and product mix 
the company expects gross profit margin to improve gradually with the launch of the icl in the united states 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or  over fiscal primarily due to increased insurance premiums and increased professional fees  particularly legal and settlement fees associated with the class action lawsuit 
the company does not expect significant increases in general and administrative expenses in marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal primarily as a result of cost reduction measures taken during and a decrease in 
table of contents us commissions due to decreased cataract product sales 
the company expects marketing and selling expenses to increase approximately  in as a result of increased promotional activities associated with the launch of the icl in the us further  marketing and selling expenses in the us will also increase as a result of increased commissions associated with the icl 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the fiscal  decreased  or  compared to fiscal  as anticipated  because significant consulting costs were incurred in the previous year in preparation for fda audits in the company s nidau  switzerland and monrovia  california facilities 
the company expects research and development expenses to increase in based upon planned iol development activities  costs associated with the ticl supplement to be filed with the fda  and the initiation of icl post marketing studies 
other charges 
other charges for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded additional reserves totaling  against promissory notes of a former director of the company 
aggregate principal and accrued interest owed to the company under the notes was million as of december   against which the company has reserved a total of million 
the former director is in default under the notes and a related forbearance agreement with the company  but has recently affirmed his obligation to pay the full principal and interest under the notes 
on these events  the company re evaluated its likelihood of collecting on the notes and re examined the collateral for the notes  which consists of a pledge of  shares of the company s common stock the pledged shares and a second mortgage on a home in florida 
during the third quarter of  the company was advised that its collateral may be compromised with respect to the second mortgage 
accordingly  the company increased its reserve on the notes to reflect the status of the collateral 
notwithstanding the additional reserve amount  the company believes the former director is obligated to repay the full amount of principal and interest on the notes  and continues to pursue full repayment of the notes 
other income expense  net 
other income  net for fiscal was  compared to fiscal when it was expense of  the principal reasons for the increase in other income are due to  of exchange gains recorded during the year versus  of exchange losses recorded during fiscal  increased interest income due to higher cash balances and interest rates  and  in earnings from the company s joint venture versus  of losses recorded during fiscal income taxes 
the company recorded income taxes of million for fiscal and million for fiscal  primarily based on the income of the company s german subsidiary 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
product sales for the years ended december  fiscal and january  fiscal were million and million  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates had a favorable impact on product sales of approximately million for fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in product sales  excluding the impact of exchange rates  was a decrease in us iol sales due to i the decline in the silicone iol market as many surgeons now choose lenses made of acrylic material  ii the company s failure to match competitors improvements to iol technology  iii the market response to the company s compliance issues with the fda and iv the lack of competitive lens delivery systems 
the company also experienced decreased sales of distributed products as it concentrates on the distribution of its higher margin proprietary products 
the decreases in us iol sales and sales of distributed products were partially offset by increased sales of the company s visian tm icl icl and visian tm ticl ticl in international markets  sales of the newly launched preloaded iols in international markets  and increased sales of cruise control 
total revenues for included  in royalties from technology licenses that terminated in gross profit 
gross profit margin decreased to of revenues for fiscal  from of revenues for fiscal the most significant impact on gross margins resulted from increased expenses associated with 
table of contents manufacturing engineering and quality control and assurance  an increase in inventory provisions  higher unit costs due to process changes and reduced volumes  and a shift in geographical and product mix 
marketing and selling expenses 
marketing and selling expenses for fiscal increased  or  over fiscal the increase is principally due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which negatively impacted marketing and selling expenses by  international sales and marketing expenses increased due to increased salaries  travel  and commissions 
headcount in the us increased due to the addition of direct sales representatives for a newly established sales territory in the pacific northwest region and as a result of the addition of proctors trainers hired principally to train physicians in the icl implantation technique 
these increases were offset by decreased promotional activities  primarily in response to the delay in the launch of the visian tm icl in the us and the cost savings realized from the closure of a subsidiary 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for fiscal  increased  or  compared to fiscal this was primarily due to our increased investment in insertion systems  the redesign of the collamer three piece iol and injector and preparation for the fda audit of our facilities in nidau  switzerland and monrovia  california 
increases in research and development expense were partially offset by decreased research and development expenses of subsidiaries  as all research and development efforts were consolidated into one location 
other charges 
other charges for fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  the company recorded a  reserve against the notes of a former director of the company which  at the time  totaled million including accrued interest 
the notes are collateralized by  shares of the company s common stock and a second mortgage on a home in florida

day s inventory on hand decreased from days in to days in  and increased to days in the increase in days inventory on hand from to is due to decreased sales in the us without a corresponding decrease in inventories 
despite decreased sales  the company increased its minimum inventory levels to resolve backorder issues it faced during the year 
in terms of the dollar change  inventory at the end of decreased  compared to primarily due to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  in particular the euro 
although inventory units decreased overall from to  the decrease was more than offset by higher cost inventory that was produced during the year as a result of lower than planned production volume resulting in an increase in inventory of million in over inventory  at the end of  increased million over levels due to the build up of icl inventory in preparation of the launch of the product in the us and increased collamer iol inventory based on increased demand for the product

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while the company s international business generates positive cash flow and represents of consolidated net sales  the company has reported losses on a consolidated basis for each of the last three fiscal years due to a number of factors  including eroding sales of cataract products in the us and fda compliance issues that consumed additional resources while delaying the introduction of new products in the us market 
during the last three years the company has secured additional capital to sustain operations through private sales of equity securities 
the company believes that as a result of these financings  along with expected cash from operations  it currently has sufficient cash to meet its funding requirements over the next year 
the company believes that in the near term its best prospect for returning its us and consolidated operations to profitability is the successful launch of the icl in the us in the longer term the company seeks to develop and introduce products in the us cataract market to stop further erosion of its market share and resume growth in that sector 
nevertheless  success of these strategies is not assured and  even if successful  the company is not likely to achieve positive cash flow on a consolidated basis during fiscal to avoid  if possible  additional rounds of equity financing and potential dilution to the interests of existing stockholders  the company plans to finance its operations  including the us launch of the icl  through funds from operations and existing cash resources 
the company is also seeking a line of credit through a us bank to provide an additional source of working capital for its us operations  and its swiss subsidiary has  in borrowing capacity available for swiss operations under its line of credit 
however  given its history of losses and 
table of contents negative cash flows  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to secure debt financing for its us operations on favorable terms  if at all 
if it is unable to obtain additional debt financing  the company may find it necessary to raise additional capital in the future through the sale of equity securities  but has only million shares of common stock authorized for issuance as of december   that have not already been issued or reserved for issuance on the exercise of outstanding options 
to address this issue  the company s board of directors adopted a resolution to submit a proposal to the stockholders at the annual meeting to increase the company s authorized shares of common stock 
the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  which will be largely dependent on the success of the icl  proceeds from the private placement of common stock  proceeds from option exercises  debt repayments by former directors  and borrowings under the company s foreign bank credit facilities 
any withdrawal of support from its banks could have serious consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity is also dependent  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s short term funding 
changes in the market price of our common stock affects the value of our outstanding options  and lower market prices could reduce our expected revenue from option exercises 
the business of the company is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are beyond its control  including  but not limited to  those set forth above and in the other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
such risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows

risk factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based on historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned  based on terms of sale with the customer  generally upon product shipment 
we record revenue from product sales when title and risk of ownership has been transferred to the customer  which is typically upon delivery to the customer 
the exception to this recognition policy is sales from iols distributed on a consignment basis  which are recognized when we are notified that the lens has been implanted in a patient 
during the normal course of business  the company may offer terms  including extended credit terms  and arrangements that vary by product category  owing to the differing nature of the customers 
the company believes its revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances 
see note accounting policies for a further discussion of the company s revenue recognition policy 
the company generally permits returns of product if the product is returned within the time allowed by the company  and in good condition 
the company provides allowances for returns based on an analysis of our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
while such allowances have historically been within the company s expectations  the company cannot guarantee that 
table of contents it will continue to experience the same return rates that it has in the past 
measurement of such returns requires consideration of historical return experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions and product lines  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the allowance for returns 
the company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by the company s review of its customers current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
the company considers all available information in its quarterly assessments of the adequacy of the reserves for uncollectible accounts 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation for option grants to employees and members of the board of directors using the intrinsic value method 
we also disclose on a proforma basis the effect on our earnings if we used the fair value method 
the fair value of each option grant for determining the pro forma impact of stock based compensation expense is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with weighted average assumptions 
these assumptions consist of expected dividend yield  expected volatility  expected life  and risk free interest rate 
if the assumptions used to calculate the value of each option grant do not properly reflect future activity  the weighted average fair value of our grants could be impacted 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   the valuation allowance fully offsets the value of deferred tax assets on the company s balance sheet 
net increases to the valuation allowance were   and  in  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and 
table of contents intends to defend its positions 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if the company prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
inventories 
the company provides estimated inventory allowances for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these reserves are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable market values 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the expiration of products with a shelf life of less than four months  estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
several factors may influence the realizability of its inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated 
if in the future  the company determined that its inventory was overvalued  it would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if the company determined that its inventory was undervalued  cost of sales in previous periods could have been overstated and the company would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
while such inventory losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same loss rates that it has in the past 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  including the impact of planned future product launches  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and its reported operating results 
the company recorded   and  in provisions to the statements of income for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory in  and  respectively 
at this time  management does not believe that anticipated product launches would have a material effect on the recovery of the company s existing net inventory balances 
impairment of long lived assets 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in reviewing for impairment  the company compares the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an assessment was completed under the guidance of sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of  and no impairment was identified 
see note accounting policies for a further discussion of sfas no 
goodwill 
goodwill  which has an indefinite life and was previously amortized on a straight line basis over the periods benefited  is no longer amortized to earnings  but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful 
table of contents lives 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
in the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections  which could include  but would not be limited to  future revenues  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
the company s policy is consistent with current accounting guidance as prescribed by sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
as provided under sfas no 
 an annual assessment was completed during the fourth quarter of  and no impairment was identified 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
see note accounting policies for a further discussion of sfas no 
patents and licenses 
the company also has other intangible assets consisting of patents and licenses  with a gross book value of million and accumulated amortization of million as of december  amortization is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are based on legal and contractual provisions  and range from to years 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its suppliers or customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to purchase or sell products at agreed upon prices 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future  which would affect the company s operating results 
the company does not engage in hedging transactions to offset changes in currency 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manages its risks based on management s judgment of the appropriate trade off between risk  opportunity and costs 
management does not believe that these market risks are material to the results of operations or cash flows of the company  and  accordingly  does not generally enter into interest rate or foreign exchange rate hedge instruments 
interest rate risk 
our million of debt is based on the borrowings of our international subsidiaries 
the majority of our international borrowings bear an interest rate that is linked to euro market conditions and  thus  our interest rate expense will fluctuate with changes in those conditions 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately  foreign currency risk 
our international subsidiaries operate in and are net recipients of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  our revenues benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide primarily  the euro and australian dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and particularly the strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross profit as expressed in us dollars 
additionally  as of december   all of our debt is denominated in swiss francs and as such  we are subject to fluctuations of the swiss franc as compared to the us dollar in converting the value of the debt to us dollars 
the us dollar value of the debt is increased by a weaker dollar and decreased by a stronger dollar relative to the swiss franc 

table of contents in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks include those set forth in item a
