item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations see forward looking information beginning on page and risk factors beginning on page strategic and financial repositioning overview overview our repositioning plan is based on improving operational results of our integrated electric and gas utility operations and strengthening our credit profile 
the key elements of our plan are to maintain synergies of an integrated  multi state utility 
complete our pending sale of regulated utility assets  merchant peaking power plants  and everest connections 
efficiently exit our elwood tolling obligation 
significantly reduce our debt levels 
actively work with regulators and legislators to address capital investment and fuel recovery issues in missouri 
continue to improve operational efficiency and lower earnings variability 
gain access to the capital markets on improved terms  allowing the company to more cost effectively fund investments in its rate base to meet customer needs 
this repositioning plan was developed to focus on building and maintaining the generation  transmission and distribution infrastructure necessary to provide our utility customers with safe and reliable service  while increasing the returns on invested capital in jurisdictions that lag behind those of our peers 
we intend to focus on improving our returns through future rate activities and process improvements 
asset divestures and strengthen credit profile with a stronger credit profile we will have the opportunity to invest in power generation  transmission and distribution capacity  as well as undertake environmental upgrades over the next decade 
we believe these normal course investments will not only improve the reliability and quality of our utility service  but also provide a platform for additional growth in our earnings and enhanced shareholder value 
following an extensive review and discussion with outside advisors on our stand alone regulated utility strategy  we retained investment bankers to conduct a competitive sale process for certain assets 
this auction process resulted in our execution of agreements to sell a four of our utilities including our kansas electric operations and our gas operations in michigan  minnesota  and missouri to three buyers for an aggregate base purchase price of million  b two of our merchant peaking power plants  the goose creek and raccoon creek facilities located in illinois  to amerenue for a total purchase price of million  and c everest connections for a total purchase price of million 
the utility asset sales are expected to occur at different times throughout  and the sale of the two peaking facilities is expected to be completed in the first half of we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of regulated utility assets and the non regulated assets to retire debt and other liabilities 
we have not made a final determination of which debt will be retired 
although we have debt that is callable or maturing over the next months  it may be more advantageous to pursue the retirement of other debt instruments through open market purchases  tenders or exchanges 
the particular debt instruments to be retired will depend upon market conditions  the market price of the particular debt instrument  the call provisions or lack there of  the remaining life of the instrument  our near term capital needs and the timing of the receipt of the sales proceeds 
we intend to apply the sales proceeds in a manner which maximizes the improvement to our credit profile and cash flow 
historical review of repositioning efforts in response to significant changes in the energy industry during the past few years  we undertook a strategic review of our business in the second quarter of and announced a change in our strategic direction 
our revised strategy features a concentrated focus on our utility operations  which preceded our diversification into merchant and international arenas in the s 
as part of this repositioning  we took the following actions in began the wind down of our merchant services trading portfolio in north america and europe  sold our natural gas storage facilities in both north america and the united kingdom  sold substantially all of our merchant loan portfolio  sold our gas gathering and processing business located primarily in texas and oklahoma  reduced our investment in quanta services  inc which builds and maintains networks that carry energy and telecommunications from to  sold our equity investment in regulated utility operations in new zealand  and eliminated our quarterly dividend 
separately  we restructured our electric and gas utilities in to more closely align them with their regulatory service areas 
due to our ongoing restructuring efforts since march  we reduced staff by approximately  employees  including those transferred with the sale of various businesses 
of these  were corporate or utilities employees 
in  we continued to execute on our transition plan through the following actions sold our remaining investment in quanta services  inc  sold our australian investments  signed an agreement to sell our united kingdom utility investment  which we completed in january  entered into a million three year secured term loan  terminated our capacity payment obligations under our acadia tolling agreement  signed agreements to sell our canadian utility businesses  which we completed in the second quarter of  signed agreements to sell our equity investment in independent power plants  which we completed in the first half of  pursued rate increases for certain of our gas and electric operations  and continued the wind down of our wholesale energy trading businesses in north america and europe 
in  we continued to implement our restructuring plan through the following actions  among others sold our investment in a merchant power plant development project in the united kingdom  settled rate cases relating to our missouri and colorado electric and missouri and nebraska gas utility operations and pursued rate relief for our kansas electric and gas utility operations  terminated our capacity payment obligations under our aries tolling agreement and exited our investment in the aries merchant power plant  received a distribution on our investment in the baf energy cogeneration project  renewed our day letter of credit facility  sold a non strategic natural gas system located in eastern missouri  terminated four long term natural gas supply contracts  issued million shares of common stock and million of pies  raising million in net proceeds  retired the million three year secured term loan due in april  entered into a million five year unsecured term loan and a million five year revolving credit facility  and entered into a million six month revolving credit facility secured by the accounts receivable of our regulated operations 
proceeds from these asset sales were used to pay down debt  fund restructuring charges and support our continuing operations 
in  we further implemented our repositioning plan through the following actions  among others exited merchant obligations and sold merchant assets  including the batesville tolling contract  the pacificorp stream flow contract  our ownership interest in ice  and the red lake gas storage development project  settled rate cases relating to our kansas electric and gas utility operations and pursued rate relief for our iowa gas utility operations and our missouri electric and steam operations  which were approved in early  completed an exchange offer that converted approximately of our pies units into our common stock earlier than the pies mandatory conversion date september   thereby reducing our interest expense  entered into a million four year revolving credit facility secured by certain of our gas and electric utilities accounts receivables  and entered into a million five year unsecured credit and letter of credit facility  under which we may have letters of credit issued without having to cash collateralize the letters of credit 
entered into a million five year secured credit facility  which provides the funding required for our investment in the iatan power plant and our share of certain environmental improvements required by the iatan power plant 
entered into agreements to sell our kansas electric operations and our gas operations in michigan  minnesota and missouri to three buyers for a total base purchase price of million  entered into agreements to sell our two illinois merchant peaking power plants to amerenue for a total purchase price of million  and initiated an auction process to sell everest connections  our telecommunication business serving the greater kansas city area 
on march   we agreed to sell everest connections for a base purchase price of million 
liquidity and capital resources working capital requirements the most significant activity impacting working capital is the purchase of natural gas for our gas utility customers 
we could experience significant working capital requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption  during potential periods of high natural gas prices and due to our current requirement to prepay certain gas commodity suppliers and pipeline transportation companies 
under a stressed weather and commodity price environment  such as the spike in commodity prices following the recent hurricanes  we estimate this working capital peak to be up to million 
we anticipate using the combination of revolving credit and letter of credit facilities listed below and cash on hand to meet our peak winter working capital requirements 
credit facility expiration maximum capacity borrowings or letters of credit issued at december  in millions four year secured revolving credit facility april  five year unsecured revolving credit facility september  million unsecured revolving credit and letter of credit facility april  million secured revolving credit facility april  options to extend to july  million unsecured revolving credit and letter of credit facility december  borrowings under these facilities must be repaid within days unless we obtain regulatory approval to incur long term indebtedness under these facilities 
issuances above million are currently cash collateralized 
the sale of our michigan  minnesota and missouri gas operations is expected to reduce our peak working capital requirements by approximately 
cash flows our statement of cash flows for the three years ended december  includes the cash flows related to our discontinued operations 
included in our cash provided from operating activities in is approximately million of cash flows associated with our discontinued operations 
our cash used for investing activities in includes approximately million of additions to utility plant and million of investments in communication services which are associated with our discontinued operations 
our cash flows from financing activities for includes million of issuance of long term debt related to our discontinued operations 
cash flows from operating activities our positive operating cash flows were driven primarily by the return of million of funds on deposit as a result of the replacement of cash deposits with letters of credit 
the increase in natural gas prices required our merchant and utilities counterparties to post an additional million of collateral with us 
offsetting these increases were the use of million of cash to inject higher cost natural gas into storage for the winter heating season  a income tax payment of million related to the sale of our canadian utilities business in  and the million settlement with enron in connection with the netting of amounts owed under various contracts at the time of enron s bankruptcy filing in our cash flows from operations were negative due to significant cash impacts resulting primarily from our operating net loss  the exiting of our non core businesses including the termination of four long term gas contracts  and the continued wind down of our merchant services business 
our negative cash flows were driven by the following events and factors we had a net loss from continuing operations of million before income tax benefits  including a million loss related to the termination of four long term gas contracts 
during  we paid a million civil penalty settlement to the cftc related to the reporting of natural gas trading information to publications and we paid million to settle an appraisal rights lawsuit 
higher gas prices in resulted in increased cash payments for the purchase of gas inventory  collateral deposits and gas purchase prepayments for our gas utilities business 
we made million of net tax payments related to the sale of our consolidated canadian utility operations and other international investments 
offsetting cash outflows in were collateral returns resulting from the continued wind down of our wholesale energy trading positions and contract exits  and depreciation 
our elwood tolling contracts will have a material negative impact on our operating cash flows for the foreseeable future 
we are attempting to restructure or terminate the elwood tolling contracts 
any cash payment made to exit this obligation would have a negative impact on operating cash flows in the year the payment is made  but would improve operating cash flows in future periods 
our significant debt load relative to our overall capitalization and the interest rate we pay on million of our long term debt has substantially increased our interest costs and will continue to negatively impact our operating cash flows 
it will be important for us to substantially improve our operating cash flows 
we are attempting to do this by improving the efficiency of our remaining businesses  increasing sales through utility rates  retiring debt and completing the wind down of our merchant services business 
cash flows from investing activities the decrease in cash provided from used for investing activities in compared to was primarily the result of the receipt of cash proceeds on the sale of our former investments in independent power plants and canadian utility businesses 
cash flows provided from investing activities increased in compared to  primarily due to an increase in net proceeds received from the sales of our canadian utility businesses  independent power plants  and midlands electricity 
in  we received proceeds from the sale of our merchant loan portfolio  our investments in australian network companies and quanta services  and our gas gathering and pipeline assets 
in addition  we had lower merchant capital expenditures and investments in unconsolidated merchant subsidiaries in compared to  due to the completion of construction of a merchant power plant in june  and the sale of our aries power project in march our utility capital expenditures decreased in due to the sale of our canadian utility businesses in may cash flows from financing activities cash flows used for financing activities decreased in compared to  primarily due to funds used in to terminate four of our long term gas contracts  and retire debt associated with our acquisition of midlands electricity  our and senior notes  our three year secured term loan and debt related to our canadian utility operations 
partially offsetting this decrease was the issuance of common stock and the pies which generated approximately million in august cash flows from financing activities decreased in compared to our net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash we paid to retire our short and long term debt obligations and to terminate four of our long term gas contracts  offset in part by the issuance of our common stock  mandatorily convertible pies and our five year unsecured term loan 
in  we retired the midlands electricity acquisition note  our three year secured term loan  our and senior notes  and debt related to our canadian utility operations 
in  we retired the debt associated with our investment in australia and the construction of our merchant power plants 
additionally  we paid million for the termination of our obligations under four long term gas contracts in the funds used to retire debt and terminate our long term gas contracts were provided by investing activities  and the proceeds from our issuance of million shares of common stock  our mandatorily convertible pies and our million five year unsecured term loan 
current credit ratings credit ratings impact our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financing and vendor payment terms  including collateral and prepayment requirements 
our financial flexibility is limited because of restrictive covenants and other terms that are typically imposed on non investment grade borrowers 
as of december   our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  as assessed by the three major credit rating agencies  were as follows agency rating commentary moody s b positive outlook s p b positive outlook fitch b positive outlook debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of the issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
in general  lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and or impaired ability to borrow 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
any rating below bbb  for s p and fitch  or baa  for moody s  is considered to be non investment grade and indicates that the security is speculative in nature 
a bb rating  for s p and fitch  or a ba rating  for moody s  indicates that the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  however  it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb or ba  but the obligor currently has capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus and minus symbols  for s p and fitch  and the  modifiers  for moody s  show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
we do not have any trigger events ie  an acceleration of repayment of outstanding indebtedness  an increase in interest costs or the posting of additional cash collateral tied to our stock price and have not executed any transactions that require us to issue equity based on our credit ratings or other trigger events 
if our credit ratings improve to certain levels  the interest rates on million of our long term debt obligations will be lowered 
collateral positions as of december   we had posted collateral for the following in the form of cash or cash collateralized letters of credit in millions trading positions utility cash collateral requirements elwood tolling contract insurance and other total funds on deposit collateral requirements for our remaining trading positions will fluctuate based on the movement in commodity prices and our credit rating 
changes in collateral requirements will vary depending on the magnitude of the price movement and the current position of our trading portfolio 
as these trading positions settle in the future  the collateral will be returned 
we are required to post collateral with certain commodity and pipeline transportation vendors 
this amount will fluctuate depending on gas prices and projected volumetric deliveries 
the ultimate return of this collateral is dependent on the strengthening of our credit profile 
we have been required to post collateral related to our elwood tolling contract until we either successfully restructure the contract or obtain investment grade credit ratings from certain major rating agencies 
we will not be required to post any additional collateral related to this contract 
we are required to post collateral with certain insurance providers representing an amount equal to our estimated claim reserves for our multiple year policies 
the return of this collateral is dependent on various factors including the improvement of our credit rating  the ultimate payout of claims over time and the sale of our electric and gas utilities 
contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations include maturities of short term and long term debt  cash payments for our two remaining long term gas contracts  minimum payments on operating leases and regulated power  gas and coal purchase contracts  as well as the elwood tolling contracts and merchant gas transportation obligations 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these obligations 
the amounts of total continuing and discontinued operations contractual cash obligations maturing in each of the next five years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total continuing operations short term and long term debt obligations a interest on long term debt b long term gas contracts lease and other obligations elwood tolling contracts merchant gas transportation obligations non qualified pension and other post retirement benefits c regulated purchase obligations total continuing operations discontinued operations long term debt obligations interest on long term debt b 

lease and other obligations regulated purchase obligations total discontinued operations total  a long term debt obligations maturing in does not include the non cash  mandatory conversion of million of pies to common stock on september  b interest on long term debt is estimated based on scheduled maturity dates of debt outstanding at december  and does not reflect anticipated early redemptions  tenders or exchanges 
variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of december  c includes total estimated contributions for non qualified pension benefits and other post retirement benefits continuing and discontinued operations as described in note to consolidated financial statements 
regulated business purchase obligations in  our continuing electric utility operations generated of the power delivered to their customers 
our electric utility operations purchase coal and natural gas  including transportation capacity  as fuel for its generating power plants under long term contracts with the longest extending through we also purchase power and gas to meet customer needs under short term and long term purchase contracts 
long term gas contracts we accounted for the advance cash payments we received under these contracts as liabilities 
we reduce our obligation for these long term gas contracts as the gas is delivered to the customer under the units of revenue method 
if we were to default on these obligations  or were unable to perform on them  we would be required to pay the issuers of the surety bonds or the counterparties on these arrangements approximately million 
this amount is greater than the long term gas contract balance on our consolidated balance sheet due to our use of the units of revenue method versus a present value method applied under the default provisions of the contractual agreements 
we do not intend to terminate these remaining contracts 
elwood tolling contracts because it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating the elwood power plant will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sales  during the foreseeable future  we believe that our capacity to generate power from the elwood power plant will largely be unutilized 
before including existing forward sales contracts  we expect to incur pretax losses and negative operating cash flows of approximately million in related to these contracts 
we are attempting to terminate or restructure this obligation 
off balance sheet arrangements the term off balance sheet arrangement generally means any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that we do not consolidate is a party  under which we have i any obligation arising under a guarantee contract  derivative instrument or variable interest  or ii a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to such entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets 
as of december   we have obligations under certain off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that may be material to investors 
these are discussed below 
equity put rights certain minority owners of everest connections had the option to sell their ownership units to us if everest connections did not meet certain financial and operational performance measures as of december  target based put rights 
if the target based put rights were exercised  we would have been obligated to purchase up to million and million ownership units at a price of and per unit  respectively  for a total potential cost of million 
as a result of our reduced funding of this business  management assessed the likelihood of achieving these metrics and during recorded a probability weighted expense of million 
in  we achieved the operating targets related to million and million of ownership units at a price of and per unit  respectively 
therefore  we reversed million of this reserve 
the holders of these ownership units are disputing our conclusion that we have achieved these operating targets and are attempting to exercise these target based put rights 
we do not believe we have any obligation with regard to these target based put rights 
we did not achieve the targets related to million of ownership units at a price of per unit 
the holders of these target based put rights exercised their options and were paid million for their ownership units in february the minority owners of million ownership units have also notified us that they intend to exercise their option to sell their ownership units to us at fair market value market based put rights 
we have not provided for this potential obligation as the exercise would represent an equity transaction at fair value 
we do not believe based on current estimates of fair value that these market based put rights are a material contingent obligation 
capital expenditures we estimate future cash requirements for capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment additions will be as follows actual estimated future cash requirements in millions electric utilities gas utilities corporate and other total continuing operations discontinued operations total capital expenditures iatan our power supply plan indicates the need for additional base load capacity in missouri after there is generally a five to seven year lead time required between the decision to proceed with a coal fired generating project and the completion of development  permitting  construction and performance testing of such a project 
kcpl has received approval of its long term energy plan from the missouri commission that includes the construction of up to mw of coal fired generating capacity at the existing iatan site in weston  missouri 
the additional generating capacity is presently planned for commercial operation in on january   the missouri department of natural resources issued a permit to construct air permit to kcpl for construction of iatan and air pollution control additions for iatan we were chosen by kcpl to participate in the construction of the iatan plant  and we will have an ownership share commensurate with our existing ownership of iatan 
we are currently negotiating participation documents which are expected to be executed during the first half of the capital requirements included in the table above for this participation  including capitalized interest  are estimated as follows million  million  million and million 
regulatory approvals required for financing we are required to obtain the prior approval of the ferc  kansas commission and colorado commission prior to issuing long term debt or stock 
we have not requested approvals to incur additional long term debt 
we are also required to obtain the prior approval of the ferc to issue short term debt 
we have obtained their approval to have outstanding up to million of additional secured or unsecured short term debt 
our authority to issue short term debt expires in april  and  on february   we filed an application with the ferc requesting authority to issue up to million of short term debt from time to time over the next two years 
we must also obtain the prior approval of the kansas commission to issue short term debt except as required to meet our working capital requirements 
the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the ferc and the regulatory commission in the state in which the utility assets are located 
restriction on ability to issue common stock our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to million shares of common stock  million shares of class a common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
of the million shares of common stock authorized to be issued  million shares have either been issued or reserved for issuance in connection with the conversion of our pies or pursuant to employee compensation plans 
accordingly  unless our certificate of incorporation is amended with the approval of our shareholders  our ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock is severely restricted 
financial review this review of performance is organized by business segment  reflecting the way we managed our business during the periods covered by this report 
each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we use ebitda as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our segment business leaders 
because financing for the various business segments is generally completed at the parent company level  ebitda provides our management and third parties an indication of how well individual business segments are performing 
therefore  each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting ebitda  while financing and income taxes are separately discussed at the corporate level 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have reported the results of operations of the following assets in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income i our kansas electric utility operations and our michigan  minnesota  and missouri gas utility operations  ii our goose creek and raccoon creek peaking power plants in illinois  iii our communications business  everest connections  iv our canadian utility businesses that we sold in may  and v our consolidated independent power plants  lake cogen and onondaga  that we sold in march therefore  the operating results of these assets are discussed separately from the reporting segments to which they relate under the caption discontinued operations 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  only direct operating costs associated with the utility divisions currently held for sale have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
the costs related to executive management and centralized services that have been allocated to these divisions remain in continuing operations 
we are developing a comprehensive plan to eliminate the majority of these costs when these support services are no longer required 
we expect that a portion of these costs could be reallocated to the remaining utilities 
the use of ebitda as a performance measure is not meant to be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our use of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities

net loss 
key factors impacting continuing operating results our total ebitda increased significantly in compared to key factors affecting results were as follows total utilities ebitda increased million primarily due to favorable weather for our electric utilities  and rate increases in missouri  colorado and kansas and customer growth  offset in part by higher costs for natural gas used for fuel and increased labor and compensation costs 
the continued wind down of our energy trading businesses in  including million of net gains related to the sale of our investment in ice and the red lake gas storage development project and the termination of our batesville tolling agreement and associated forward sale contract  resulted in a million increase in ebitda compared to merchant services ebitda in included million of net losses on sale of assets and other charges  and million of margin losses primarily associated with our former long term gas contracts  alternative risk contracts  and other trading activities 
corporate and other loss before ebitda decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the non cash loss on the early conversion of the pies

favorable weather related volume and other variances increased gross profit by million in the favorable impacts above were offset in part by higher costs of fuel  purchased power  transmission and emission allowances  net of offsetting derivative settlements and off system sales which reduced margins by approximately million as compared to operating expense operating expenses consisted of the following year ended december  in millions operating expenses of colorado and missouri electric allocated expenses of kansas electric total operating expenses operating expense increased million from primarily due to approximately million of higher labor and benefit costs and million of increased outside service costs associated with storm related outages in other income other income increased million in compared to primarily due to increased afudc associated with the construction of our south harper peaking facility  which began in late afudc represents the cost of both debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period 
afudc is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plant and is credited to other income 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due to additional plant placed in service  primarily the south harper peaking facility 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit sales and cost of sales for the electric utilities businesses increased million and million  respectively  resulting in a gross profit increase of million in compared to these changes were primarily due to the following factors sales and gross profit increased by million due to rate increases in colorado effective in july and in missouri effective in april  plus million of additional margin from an increase in customers 
these were partially offset by a million increase in cost of sales due to the higher cost of fuel and purchased power  net of offsetting derivative hedge positions in and unfavorable weather decreased gross profit by million 
in addition  electric cost of sales included million of favorable adjustments that did not recur in  such as settlement of purchased power pricing disputes and the greenwood energy center damage claim 
operating expense operating expense increased million in compared to  as a result of a number of cost increases 
the most significant of these was outside services and materials costs  which increased million  and labor and other compensation costs  which increased million due to additional customer service representatives  apprentice linemen  increased pension costs and compliance costs in compared to other income other income increased million in compared to primarily due to increased afudc associated with the construction of our south harper peaking facility  which began in late depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the adjustments to depreciation rates resulting from recent rate cases 
earnings trend the february settlement of our electric rate case in missouri is expected to increase annual sales by approximately million  net of the former interim energy charge 
to the extent that our costs of natural gas used for fuel and purchased power or other operating expenses increase or decrease from the level of costs recovered in the current rate case settlement  the impact of the change will affect our operating results 
the million settlement of our missouri steam case includes an sharing of fuel cost changes from the base fuel rate 
on july   union pacific railroad notified us and other utilities receiving coal shipments from the southern powder river basin that a force majeure event requiring maintenance on rail lines resulted in a reduction in contracted deliveries through november other weather and track problems have continued to limit coal deliveries and are expected to continue into we have analyzed the potential effects of these reductions in deliveries on our owned coal fired power plants and believe that our coal inventory levels are sufficient  assuming continued deliveries at these levels  to carry us through the spring and early summer without significantly reducing utilization of these plants below current levels 
we continue to hold discussions with kcpl and westar regarding our jointly owned plants  iatan and jeffrey  respectively  and have agreed to coal conservation measures at both plants 
if the deliveries are returned to normal levels before the summer cooling season  this event is not expected to have a direct material effect on our operations 
there is no assurance that deliveries will return to normal levels at this time 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  certain allocated executive management and centralized services costs associated with our electric and gas utility divisions held for sale cannot be immediately eliminated when the pending asset sales close 
we intend to eliminate these costs to the greatest extent possible and reallocate any remaining costs to the remaining utility jurisdictions where appropriate 
to the extent these costs are not recovered in other jurisdictions or we are unsuccessful in eliminating these costs  our earnings could be adversely affected 
we have entered into a program for our electric utility operations in missouri to mitigate our exposure to natural gas price volatility in the market 
this program extends multiple years and the mark to market value of the portfolio of million related to contracts that will settle against actual purchases of natural gas and purchased power in through in connection with the recently settled missouri electric rate case  we agreed that these contracts would be recognized into cost of sales when they settle 
a regulatory liability has been recorded under sfas in the amount of million to reflect the change in the timing of recognition authorized by the missouri commission 
as a result of the fuel adjustment clause legislation signed into law in july  the missouri commission will set forth rules regarding the implementation and definition of costs to be recovered in the fuel adjustment clause for our missouri electric operations 
the value of our nymex financial contracts may be a part of the defined costs to be recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
if so  the settlement of the contracts  as well as the cost of the physical fuel and purchased power from the marketplace  will flow through to the customer

regulated gas margins decreased million due to unfavorable weather and lower usage per customer in compared to regulated gas margins in included a million favorable change in reserved funds released upon conclusion of multi year gas cost recovery filings that did not recur in the overall decline in gas margins due to volume and weather was partially offset by million in rate increases in nebraska and iowa and million of increased margins from customer growth 
non regulated gas sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million and million  respectively  in compared to  primarily as the result of the sale of certain non regulated gas pipeline and gathering operations in august non regulated other sales decreased million and cost of sales increased

versus sales  cost of sales and gross loss gross loss for our merchant services operations for was million  primarily due to the following factors in  we recorded a net margin loss of million associated with our elwood tolling agreement 
we make fixed capacity payments evenly throughout the year that entitle us to generate power at the elwood plant 
the cost to purchase natural gas to fuel this power plant generally exceeded the value of the power that could be generated 
accordingly  we did not generate material revenues

we recorded a margin loss of million on the write off of certain balances retained in our previous sale of gas pipeline investments 
we also incurred margin losses of million resulting from the difference between revenue recognized on our two remaining long term gas delivery contracts compared to the net cost of gas delivered under these contracts 
partially offsetting the gross loss for was the termination of certain commodity and interest rate hedges 
the termination of the hedges and the release of our contingent obligation to the buyer of our former merchant loan portfolio resulted in the reversal of the related liability of million associated with these contracts 
gross loss for our merchant services operations for was million  primarily due to the following factors approximately million was a non cash loss related to the discounting of our trading portfolio  primarily driven by our long term gas contracts 
after updating the future cash flow stream based on the new forward natural gas prices  we discount the future cash flows of our price risk management assets based on our counterparties credit standing  versus our future cash flows of our price risk management liabilities that are discounted based on our current credit standing 
in prior periods  primarily in  when our credit standing deteriorated compared to our counterparties that make up the vast majority of our price risk management assets  we recorded non cash earnings related to the discounting of our price risk management assets and liabilities 
during  the benchmark indices we used to determine the discount rate appropriate for our credit standing decreased  resulting in the partial reversal of the previous earnings and assets recorded 
due to the settlement of four of our long term gas contracts  the future impact of non cash mark to market movements described above will be significantly reduced

the settlement of our price risk management assets and liabilities associated with four of our long term gas contracts resulted in non cash  mark to market losses of approximately million related to the discounting of our trading portfolio 
we discount the future cash flows of our price risk management assets based on our counterparties credit standing  versus our future cash flows of our price risk management liabilities that are discounted based on our current credit standing 
this resulted in the recording of a net asset related to these four long term contracts and their corresponding commodity hedges of approximately million prior to our settlement 
additionally  we recorded a margin loss of approximately million for margin recorded on these long term contracts and approximately million related to replacement gas payments we made under the termination provisions of these contracts 
we incurred approximately million of costs to manage our remaining natural gas hedge positions related to the onondaga swap derivative sold in connection with the sale of our independent power plants  cash flow hedge option premium expirations  the exit of other hedges related to previous contracts and settlements of various open positions during our remaining gross loss for mainly stems from mark to market losses and unfavorable settlements of approximately million  related to a long term power supply transaction with nyseg and our stream flow transaction 
in may  we settled our obligation under the long term power supply contract with nyseg by making a cash payment of million to a third party that assumed our obligations under this contract 
operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to the refund of approximately million of value added taxes previously paid and expensed by our european merchant trading business  the reduction of our allowance for bad debts by million  million of reduced surety payments due to the settlement of four long term gas contracts in  and million of reduced costs for staffing needed to manage our remaining trading positions and non regulated power generation assets 
these cost reductions were offset in part by the provision of million in relating to certain price reporting litigation 
restructuring charges restructuring charges increased million in compared to  primarily due to the termination of the majority of the remaining leases associated with our former merchant services headquarters in march for million which exceeded the reserve obligation by million 
net gain loss on sale of assets and other charges net gain on sale of assets and other charges in consists primarily of pretax gains of million on the termination of the batesville tolling agreement and related forward sale contract and million on the sale of our stock investment in ice and million on the sale of our red lake gas storage development project

versus sales  cost of sales and gross loss the significant factors causing our million gross loss for are described above 
gross loss for our merchant services operations for was million  primarily due to the following factors partially offsetting the losses discussed below were approximately million of non cash earnings related to the discounting of our trading portfolios  primarily driven by long term gas contracts 
during  average gas prices rose over the life of our price risk management assets and liabilities by 
per mmbtu 
in  we incurred margin losses of million  resulting from the difference between revenue recognized on our long term gas contracts and the net cost of gas delivered under these contracts 
during  we made fixed capacity payments evenly throughout the year that entitled us to generate power at merchant power plants owned by others 
for  we recorded net margin loss associated with these agreements of million 
the cost to purchase natural gas to fuel these power plants generally exceeded the value of the power that could be generated 
accordingly  we did not generate material revenues 
in  we incurred approximately million of unfavorable settlements of our highly structured stream flow and long term power supply transactions and our continued wind down of our european trading operations 
we recorded a million non cash loss related to the sale of our capacity under certain long term gas transportation agreements at substantially less than our future commitments 
although the loss was recognized for accounting purposes  the cash associated with the loss will be paid out over the term of the contracts 
we recognized approximately million of net mark to market losses on natural gas hedge positions related to the onondaga swap derivative and other hedges related to previous contracts 
the remaining million of gross loss primarily relates to mark to market losses on alternative risk contracts and settlements of various open positions during operating expense operating expense decreased million primarily due to million of expense accrued in related to our january settlement with the cftc  and lower labor and other costs related to continued reductions in staff as part of the wind down of our merchant operations 
restructuring charges restructuring charges decreased million in compared to this decrease stemmed primarily from restructuring charges of million during relating to the termination of our remaining interest rate swaps associated with the construction financings for our raccoon creek and goose creek power plants 
as debt related to these facilities was retired earlier than anticipated  our swaps exceeded our outstanding debt 
as a result  we reduced our swap position and realized the loss associated with the cancelled portion of the swaps 
net loss on sale of assets and other charges during  net loss on sale of assets and other charges totaled million as discussed above 
during  we recorded million of net loss on sale of assets and other charges 
these charges consisted of million related to the write down of our equity method investments in independent power plants 
in the third quarter of  we decided to sell our interest in these plants and therefore wrote our investments down to estimated fair value  which was less than their carrying value 
also included was a million payment for the termination of our year tolling contract for the acadia power plant  partially offset by a million gain related to the contract termination and sale of certain turbines that we had previously written down to estimated fair value 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of premiums associated with our equity method investments in independent power plants  resulting from the impairment of our investments in these plants in september equity in earnings of investments equity in earnings of investments decreased million due to the sale of our independent power plant investments in the first quarter of other income other income decreased million in primarily due to two items recorded in that did not recur in on january   the eighth circuit court of appeals overturned a prior adverse decision of the united states tax court regarding the proper depreciable life of certain of our natural gas gathering and pipeline assets 
as a result of the appeals court s decision  we reversed the accrual of million of interest expense in that would have been payable had the internal revenue service prevailed in the dispute 
we also realized foreign currency translation gains of million on the wind down of our european merchant operations in earnings trend and impact of changing business environment the merchant energy sector has been negatively impacted by the increase in generation capacity that became operational in and this increase in supply has placed downward pressure on power prices and subsequently the value of unsold merchant generation capacity 
although weather and market conditions enabled us to generate million of gross profit in  it is generally expected that the fuel and start up costs of operating our crossroads peaking power plant will exceed the revenues that would be generated from the power sold  we believe that during the foreseeable future we will have limited assurance of our ability to generate power at a gross profit 
we will continue to have operating and maintenance costs associated with our crossroads peaking power plant  whether the facility is being utilized to generate power or is idle 
we continue to look for viable solutions to the utilization of our unsold merchant generation capacity 
additionally  we will be required to make capacity payments related to our elwood tolling agreements and expect to incur pretax losses and negative operating cash flows of approximately million in related to this arrangement 
we are attempting to restructure our elwood obligation  and will incur a significant charge to the extent that we are able to exit or restructure that obligation 
as a result of the above factors and our change in strategy  we do not expect merchant services to be profitable in the next two to three years 
we recently evaluated the carrying value of our crossroads merchant peaking power plant 
as of december   the carrying value of this plant was million 
we performed this evaluation due to reduced spark spreads and an oversupply of generation that we expect will continue for the foreseeable future 
this situation has prevented the plant from producing significant margins and  in turn  has created losses for us 
it is forecasted that these losses will continue for the next few years 
we separately tested the cash flows for the plant based on estimated margin contributions and forecasted operating expenses over its remaining plant life 
the peaking plant was placed into service in and we depreciate the facility over years 
in evaluating future estimated margin contributions  we used external price curves based on four different future price environments 
in each environment  we calculated an average margin contribution based on a multi simulation scenario analysis and then equally weighted each price environment 
based on this analysis and the level of probability we would sell the asset  the undiscounted probability weighted cash flows for the plant exceeded its current book value 
therefore  under sfas no impairment was required as of december  we have evaluated this asset as held and used 
if at some future date we determine this asset is held for sale  based on current market values  we would likely record a material impairment charge

in addition  we recognized an additional million loss on three natural gas combustion turbines that were held by one of our non regulated subsidiaries and were transferred to our missouri electric operations at their current fair value 
in connection with the settlement of our recent missouri electric rate case  we agreed with the missouri commission staff and other interveners that fair value was approximately million lower than that estimated in the loss on sale of assets and other charges of million is mainly due to the million impairment on three natural gas combustion turbines that were held by one of our non regulated subsidiaries and were transferred to our missouri electric operations in at their estimated current fair value 
the impairment was partially offset by the reversal of a million liability we recorded at corporate related to our everest connections target based put rights due to the meeting of certain financial and operational performance measures  and the million gain we recorded in connection with the sale of our interest in midlands electricity in january the midlands electricity investment was written down to its estimated fair value in and again in september however  due to strengthening of the british pound exchange rate in the fourth quarter of and in early  we realized a gain on the closing of the sale

sales and cost of sales increased approximately million due to a increase in natural gas prices since december  however  because gas purchase costs for our gas utility operations are passed through to our customers  the change in gas prices did not have a corresponding impact on gross profit 
sales and gross profit increased by million due to rate increases in missouri effective in may and july sales and gross profit increases of million due to the pipeline supplier metering adjustments in associated with prior periods were offset by the impacts of milder winter weather and other volume variances in as compared to other other sales  cost of sales and gross profit decreased million  million  and million  respectively  in compared to our canadian utilities and independent power plants  which had gross profit of million  were sold in the first half of slightly offsetting this lost profit was a million increase in everest connections gross profit as compared to due to an increase in customers served and a million increase in gross profit earned by the illinois peaking power plants related to increased demand for peaking power and short term capacity contracts in operating expense operating expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to the sale of our consolidated independent power plants and our canadian utility businesses in the first half of both the electric and gas utility operations also experienced operating expense decreases in  related primarily to property tax settlements in michigan and minnesota  lower property tax expenses in all states  and reductions in the reserves needed for bad debt and general claims

sfas requires that depreciation expense no longer be recorded for those assets classified for accounting purposes as held for sale 
the decrease was partially offset by increased depreciation expense related to the expansion of everest connections communication network to accommodate customer growth 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the repayment or assumption of debt associated with our canadian utility businesses that were sold in may income tax expense benefit income tax expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the pretax loss in related to the impairment of our investments in illinois peaking power plants in the income tax benefit on a pretax loss from discontinued operations was primarily the result of the impairment of our illinois peaking facilities  while the income tax expense on pretax income from discontinued operations resulted from the pretax gain on the sale of our canadian utility businesses 
the tax expense on that gain was substantially higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the following factors 
the us taxes reflect the partial deduction of canadian taxes  including withholding taxes  from the us taxable income instead of the full utilization of foreign tax credits 
taxes on the sale also reflect our inability to fully utilize the tax loss on the sale of the alberta business against the tax gain on the sale of the british columbia business 
versus sales  cost of sales and gross profit electric utilities sales  cost of sales and gross profit for our kansas electric utility increased million  million  and 
million  respectively  in compared to higher off system sales activity in was the primary driver of these increases  resulting in a million rise in gross profit 
offsetting this increase was the impact of a sale of green credits awarded to us for using environmentally friendly generation 
no similar sale occurred in gas utilities sales and cost of sales for michigan  minnesota  and missouri gas utilities increased million and million  respectively  resulting in a million decrease in gross profit 
this decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of milder weather in and a pipeline supplier metering adjustment in michigan 
the increase in sales and cost of sales in compared to was primarily the result of higher natural gas prices which are passed through to our customers 
other other sales and cost of sales decreased million and million  respectively  resulting in a gross profit decrease of million in compared to sales  cost of sales and gross profit for our canadian utility business decreased million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the sale of these businesses in may canadian utility sales  cost of sales and gross profit in june through december were million  million and million  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by the march decision by the alberta energy utilities board aeub to reduce our and customer billing rates 
the aeub decision resulted in an adjustment that reduced our first quarter sales and gross profit by approximately million 
sales  cost of sales and gross profit for lake cogen and onondaga were lower in by million  million and million  respectively  due to the sale of these businesses in early march and a price dispute settlement that increased lake cogen s sales by million 
everest connections gross profit increased million in as compared to due to an increase in customers served  slightly offsetting that increase was a million decrease in gross profit earned by the illinois peaking power plants

sfas requires that depreciation expense no longer be recorded for those assets classified for accounting purposes as held for sale 
the decrease was offset by the million adjustment in the first quarter of related to the decision by the aeub to reduce the depreciation rates on most of our distribution assets in alberta 
interest expense interest expense decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the sale of our canadian utility businesses in may income tax expense income tax expense increased million in compared to the income tax expense on pretax income from discontinued operations was primarily the result of taxes associated with the gain on the sale of our canadian utility businesses 
the effective tax rate on the pretax gain on sale of our canadian utility businesses is substantially higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the following factors 
the us taxes reflect the partial deduction of canadian taxes  including withholding taxes  from the us taxable income instead of the full utilization of foreign tax credits 
taxes on the sale also reflect our inability to fully utilize the tax loss on the sale of the alberta business against the tax gain on the sale of the british columbia business 
offsetting the income tax expense was the reversal of million of valuation allowances provided in related to the impairment of our investments in independent power plants 
this valuation allowance was reversed in when the final sale structure was determined and an updated estimate of expected capital losses was completed 
in addition  our former alberta utility recognized income taxes using the flow through method 
as a result  the elimination of depreciation in and the adjustment of depreciable lives due to the regulatory decision increased pretax income but had no impact on income tax expense 
other items critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these statements include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies 
as discussed below  while we believe these financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard to amounts that are based on our judgments and estimates  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include energy trading and derivative accounting the portion of our trading activities that qualify as derivatives under sfas is recorded under the mark to market method of accounting 
the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of our portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as closing exchange rates  over the counter quotes  historical volatility and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable amount of time under current market conditions 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
as a result  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
operating results can also be affected by changes in underlying factors used in the determination of fair value of our portfolio such as the following we have variability in our mark to market earnings due to changes in the market price for gas and or power 
our portfolio is valued from current and expected future gas and power prices 
changes in these prices can cause fluctuations in our earnings 
we discount our price risk management assets and liabilities using risk free interest rates adjusted for our credit standing and the credit standings of our counterparties in accordance with sfas which is more fully described in statement of financial accounting concepts no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurement 
because our price risk management liabilities are discounted using our credit standing  versus the receivable side of these transactions which are discounted based on our counterparties credit standings which on average are higher than ours  non cash mark to market earnings or losses are created 
as these spreads narrow  we record mark to market losses  as they widen  we record mark to market gains 
these gains and losses can fluctuate if our credit or the credit of a group of our counterparties deteriorates or improves significantly 
we also have other activities in our utility operations that are accounted for under sfas the majority of these activities consist of the purchasing of gas  power and coal for our utility operations  which fall under the normal purchases and sales exception 
these activities require that management make certain judgments regarding the election of the normal purchases and sales exceptions 
in addition  as allowed by state regulatory commissions  we have entered into certain financial instruments to reduce our customers underlying exposure to fluctuations in gas prices 
these financial instruments are considered derivatives under sfas and are marked to market and recorded in our pga accounts as they are collectible under the provisions of the pga upon settlement 
we also have entered into a program for our electric utility operations in missouri to mitigate our exposure to natural gas price volatility in the market 
this program extends multiple years and the mark to market value of the portfolio of million related to contracts that will settle against actual purchases of natural gas and purchased power in through in connection with the recently settled missouri electric rate case  we agreed that these contracts would be recognized into cost of sales when they settle 
a regulatory liability has been recorded under sfas in the amount of million to reflect the change in the timing of recognition authorized by the missouri commission 
unbilled utility revenues sales related to the delivery of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of sales is based on reading customers meters  which occurs systematically throughout the month 
at the end of each month  an estimate is made of the amount of energy delivered to customers after the date of the last meter reading 
the unbilled revenue is calculated each month based on estimated customer usage  weather factors  line losses and applicable customer rates 
total unbilled revenues for continuing operations at december  were million 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
unforeseen events and changes in conditions could indicate that these carrying values may not be recoverable and may therefore result in impairment charges 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds its future undiscounted cash flows 
once deemed impaired  the long lived asset is written down to its fair value 
the determination of future cash flows  and  if required  fair value of a long lived asset is by its nature a highly subjective judgment 
fair value is determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital  third party contracted bids or appraisals performed by a qualified party 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the long term estimated cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of our long lived assets 
we have evaluated the carrying value of the crossroads peaking power plant we contractually control and which is classified as held and used 
as of december   the carrying value of this plant was million 
we performed this evaluation due to reduced spark spreads and an oversupply of generation that we expect will continue for the foreseeable future 
this situation has prevented this plant from firing and  in turn  has created losses for us 
it is forecasted that this loss will continue for the next few years 
we tested the cash flows for the plant based on estimated margin contributions and forecasted operating expenses over its remaining plant life 
this peaking plant was placed into service in and we depreciate this facility over years 
in evaluating future estimated margin contributions  we used external price curves based on four different future price environments 
in each environment  we calculated an average margin contribution based on a multi simulation scenario analysis and then equally weighted each price environment 
based on this analysis and the level of probability we would sell this asset  the undiscounted probability weighted cash flows for this plant exceeded its current book value 
therefore  under sfas no impairment was required as of december  we have evaluated this asset as held and used 
if at some future date we determine this asset is held for sale  based on current market values  we would likely record a material impairment charge 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test it for impairment each year on november  and if impaired  write it off against earnings at that time 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined on a discounted cash flow basis or other fair market value methods  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied goodwill excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value assigned to its assets and liabilities with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of goodwill  and thus any impairment  is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period because it requires us to make cash flow assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over an indefinite life  and the impact of recognizing an impairment could be material 
management s assumptions about future sales margins and volumes require significant judgment because actual margins and volumes have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 
in estimating future margins and expenses  we use our internal budgets 
we develop our budgets based on anticipated customer growth  rate cases  inflation and weather trends 
total goodwill at december  was million 
regulatory accounting implications we currently record the economic effects of regulation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
accordingly  our balance sheet reflects certain costs as regulatory assets 
we are required to periodically assess the probable recovery of our regulatory assets 
we expect our rates will continue to be based on historical costs for the foreseeable future 
however  if we no longer qualified for treatment under sfas  we would make adjustments to the carrying value of our regulatory assets and liabilities and would be required to recognize them in current period earnings 
total regulatory assets and liabilities at december  were million and million  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
valuation of deferred tax assets we are required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets generated from net operating losses and capital losses incurred on the sale of assets using a more likely than not assessment of realization 
this assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within our control  including assumptions regarding the availability and character of future taxable income 
as of december   we have recorded million of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of the tax asset is mainly dependent on the availability of future capital gains and taxable income in certain states 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from that recorded  as impacted by changes in federal income tax laws and upon the generation of future capital gains or state taxable income to enable us to realize the related tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards originating in  million of estimated federal net operating losses originating in and an estimated million of federal net operating losses originating in the federal net operating loss carryforward expires in and can be carried back to to offset potential irs audit adjustments 
the and federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in and  respectively  and cannot be carried back due to losses in the carryback years 
we did not record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets related to federal net operating losses 
this determination was based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that we will realize these deferred assets during the carryforward period 
this assessment considered the forecasted reversal of existing temporary differences and taxable income expected to be generated in the carryforward period and potential irs audit adjustments in reserve for contingent tax liabilities as of december   we have recorded liabilities of million for cumulative tax provisions for tax deduction or income positions taken in prior tax returns that we believe were properly treated on such tax returns but for which it is reasonably likely that these deductions or income positions will be challenged when the returns are audited 
the tax returns containing these tax deductions or income positions are currently under audit or will likely be audited 
the reserve is included in deferred tax liabilities because the timing of the resolution of these audits is uncertain and if the positions taken on the tax returns are not ultimately sustained  we may be required to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  and or general business credit carryforwards and or make cash payments plus interest 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a contingent tax liability is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  reserves are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our tax deductions or income positions and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of contingent tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
pension plans our reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits described in note to the consolidated financial statements are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may also impact current and future pension costs 
pension costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
as of september   our average assumed discount rate was and our average expected return on plan assets was 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
while the chart below reflects an increase in the percentage for each assumption  we and our actuaries expect that the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation pbo at december   and our estimated annual pension cost apc on the income statement for by a similar amount in the opposite direction

legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
significant balance sheet movements total assets decreased by million since december  this decrease is primarily due to the following cash decreased million 
see our consolidated statement of cash flows for analysis of this decrease 
funds on deposit decreased million  primarily due to the return of margin deposits paid to counterparties in connection with the continued wind down of our wholesale energy trading portfolio and the replacement of cash collateral with uncollateralized letters of credit  offset in part by additional requirements by our suppliers of natural gas that we post additional margin deposits as a result of our non investment grade credit rating and increased natural gas prices 
accounts receivable increased million  primarily due to increased natural gas prices since december   offset in part by lower volumes of natural gas and electricity delivered due to the continued wind down of wholesale energy trading business 
price risk management assets increased million  primarily due to an increase in natural gas prices since december  property  plant and equipment  net  increased million primarily due to the construction of our south harper peaking facility in current and non current assets of discontinued operations decreased million  primarily due to the impairment of our illinois peaking power plants in  offset in part by increased accounts receivables in the gas states due to higher natural gas prices 
total liabilities decreased by million and common shareholders equity increased by million since december  these changes are primarily attributable to the following price risk management liabilities increased million  primarily due to an increase in natural gas prices since december  customer funds on deposit increased million  primarily due to increased margin deposits received from counterparties on in the money derivative contracts for natural gas resulting from increased natural gas prices 
short term and long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt  together decreased by million  primarily due to the early exchange of the pies for shares of common stock 
deferred income taxes and credits decreased million primarily as the result of deferred tax benefits on net operating losses 
common shareholders equity increased million  primarily as a result of the early pies exchange transaction  offset in part by the million net loss in new accounting standards in and  the fasb issued a number of interpretation  staff positions and new accounting standards that had potential impacts on our financial results

forward looking information this report contains forward looking information 
forward looking information involves risks and uncertainties  and certain important factors can cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
the forward looking statements contained in this report include we expect to improve our returns through future rate activities and process improvements 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include regulatory commissions may refuse to approve some or all of the utility rate increases we may request  and we may not be allowed by regulatory commission to keep any or all of the savings generated by our process improvements for our shareholders benefit 
the timing of utility rate increases approved by regulatory commissions is often beyond our control and  until final approval is received  our earnings will continue to be impacted 
we may not be able to improve operational efficiencies in a magnitude that would help improve our credit profile 
we expect to use the net proceeds from asset sales to retire debt and other liabilities and fund our anticipated capital expenditures  in a manner that maximizes the improvement of our credit profile 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include we may not be able to retire a sufficient principal amount of debt and other liabilities in a manner that maximizes our net sale proceeds or improves our credit sufficiently 
we may receive less net sale proceeds than anticipated due to purchase price adjustments or changes required to satisfy the conditions of regulatory orders pertaining to the asset sales 
the counterparty to the elwood tolling contract may be unwilling to terminate or restructure this contract  or we may not find a third party willing to assume this obligation upon acceptable terms 
we are developing a comprehensive plan to eliminate the majority of the allocated costs related to the utilities that are being sold when the support services are no longer required  and we expect that a portion of these costs will be reallocated to our remaining utility operations for recovery in future rate cases 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include we may not be able to eliminate a majority  or even a material amount  of the overhead costs allocated to the held for sale utility divisions 
regulatory commissions may not approve some or all of any cost reallocations in future rate cases 
we anticipate significant additional capital expenditures in order to satisfy our long term power generation and transmission needs and comply with environmental rules and regulations 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include we may not receive the approvals required to participate in the planned construction of additional generating capacity at the iatan facility near weston  missouri  and a lengthy delay in the construction of the iatan facility may require us to satisfy our baseload capacity requirements through spot market purchases 
environmental rules and regulations could change such that we are not required to make anticipated capital expenditures for environmental compliance  or such that the cost of environmental compliance is greater than anticipated 
we may not receive shareholder approval to issue additional shares of our common stock  which may be required to fund part of our anticipated future capital expenditures 
we believe that the anticipated capital costs of environmental compliance will be allowed for recovery in future rate cases 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include regulatory commissions may refuse to allow us to recover in rates part or all of the capital costs related to environmental compliance 
changes in applicable law or regulation may prohibit us from recovering in rates part or all of the capital costs related to environmental compliance 
we expect the missouri commission to issue  prior to the filing of our next electric rate case in missouri  rules implementing the fuel clause adjustment legislation recently adopted by the state of missouri 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include if the rules implementing the adopted fuel clause adjustment legislation are delayed  we may incur significant losses if we are not otherwise permitted to pass through to ratepayers costs associated with fuel purchases for our missouri electric operations 
even if the missouri commission implements the fuel clause adjustment rules prior to our next electric rate case in missouri  the missouri commission may subsequently determine that certain fuel costs were not prudently incurred and  therefore  refuse to allow such costs to be recovered in rates 
we anticipate that our current revolving credit capacity and available cash will be sufficient to fund our winter needs and working capital requirements 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include our access to revolving credit capacity depends on maintaining compliance with loan covenants 
if we violate these covenants  we may lose revolving credit capacity and not have sufficient cash available for our winter needs and working capital requirements 
unanticipated increases in the price of natural gas that we purchase for our utility customers could exhaust our liquidity in the winter months 
counterparties may default on their obligations to supply commodities or return collateral to us or to meet their obligations under commercial contracts  including those designed to hedge against movements in commodity prices 
we believe that we have strong defenses to litigation pending against us 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include judges and juries can be difficult to predict and may  in fact  rule against us 
our positions may be weakened by adverse developments in the law or the discovery of facts that hurt our cases 
we do not expect that the annual limitations on net operating losses would cause any of our net operating losses to expire unutilized for purposes of reducing our taxes 
some important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated include changes in the tax law could result in our tax net operating losses going unutilized 
the failure to generate sufficient income including income from asset sales could result in our tax net operating losses going unutilized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk utility operations our regulated businesses produce  purchase and distribute power in three states and purchase and distribute natural gas in seven states 
all of our gas distribution utilities have pga provisions that allow them to pass the prudently incurred cost of gas through to the customer 
to the extent that gas prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates  adjustments are made on a periodic basis to true up billed amounts to match the actual cost we incurred 
these adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state utility commissions 
in our continuing regulated electric business in  we generated approximately of the power that we sold and we purchased the remaining through long term contracts or in the open market 
the regulatory provisions for recovering power costs vary by state 
in kansas and colorado  we have ecas that serve a purpose similar to the pgas for our gas utilities 
to the extent that our fuel and purchased power energy costs vary from the energy cost built into our tariffs  the difference is passed through to the customer 
in missouri  we currently do not have the ability to adjust the rates we charge for electric service to offset all or part of any increase or decrease in prices we pay for natural gas  coal or other fuel we use in generating electricity ie  a fuel adjustment mechanism 
as a result  our exposure to commodity price changes has historically been concentrated in the missouri electric operations  resulting in greater earnings volatility from year to year there than in our other electric rate jurisdictions 
in july  legislation was adopted establishing a means for the recovery of prudently incurred fuel  purchased power costs and government mandated environmental investments without going through a general rate case 
the missouri commission staff has held a number of workshops with utility companies  industry groups and consumer advocates to develop rulemaking proposals 
at least one further workshop is expected in the first quarter of before final rules are issued later in the year 
we have taken several measures to mitigate the commodity price risk exposure in our missouri electric operations 
one of these measures is contracting for a diverse supply of coal to meet of our native load fuel requirements of coal fired generation in and in  respectively 
we are currently receiving reduced volumes on one of these coal contracts because of a declared partial force majeure that occurred in the price risk associated with our natural gas and on peak spot market purchased power requirements is also mitigated through a dollar cost averaging hedging plan using nymex futures contracts and options 
this is a multi year hedging plan 
as of december   we had financial contracts in place to hedge approximately of our expected on peak natural gas and natural gas equivalent purchased power price exposure for additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at our facilities that use fossil fuels 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
market risk trading we are exposed to market risk  including changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions in accordance with our policy approved by the board of directors 
our trading portfolios consist primarily of natural gas  electricity and interest rate contracts that are settled by the delivery of the commodity or cash 
these contracts take many forms  including futures  forwards  swaps and options 
as we are winding down our trading portfolio  most of our positions have been hedged to limit our exposure to the above risks 
we measure the risk in our trading portfolio using a value at risk methodology 
the value at risk calculation utilizes statistics to determine the relationship between the size of a potential loss and the probability of its occurrence  from holding an individual instrument or portfolio of instruments for a given period of time 
the quantification of market risk using value at risk methodologies provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products and is considered a best practice standard for this application 
the use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions  including selection of a confidence level we use  holding period this is the time needed to liquidate a position we use one day  and use of historical volatility and correlations with the most recent activity weighted more heavily 
the average value at risk for all commodities during was million 
our board of directors sets our value at risk limit 
we are currently limited to million for the remaining commodity trading portfolio and a million target for the aggregate book that includes the first months of merchant services asset positions 
in addition to value at risk  we also apply other risk control measures that incorporate volumetric limits by commodity  loss limits  durational limits and application of stress testing to our various risk portfolios 
all merchant interest and foreign currency risks are monitored within the commodity portfolios and value at risk calculation 
the merchant commodity portfolios are valued on a mark to market basis that requires that the trading book be discounted on a net present value basis utilizing risk adjusted current interest rates based on our credit standing and those of our counterparties 
because interest rate movements impact the value of our trading portfolio  we have used interest rate derivatives to hedge this risk and may do so in the future as the portfolio continues to wind down 
certain trading activities we engage in price risk management activities for both trading and non trading activities 
transactions carried out in connection with trading activities that are derivatives under sfas are accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
under sfas  our energy commodity trading contracts  including physical transactions mainly gas and power and financial instruments  are recorded at fair value 
as part of the valuation of our portfolio  we value the credit risks associated with the financial condition of counterparties and the time value of money 
we primarily use quoted market prices from published sources or comparable transactions in liquid markets to value our contracts 
if actively quoted market prices are not available  we contact brokers and other external sources or use comparable transactions to obtain current values of our contracts 
in addition  the market prices or fair values used in determining the value of the portfolio are our best estimates utilizing information such as historical volatility  time value  counterparty credit and the potential impact on market prices of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under current market conditions 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  certain contracts are recorded at fair value using an alternative approach such as model pricing 
the changes in fair value of our utilities and merchant services derivative contracts for are summarized below in millions utilities merchant services total fair value at december  increase decrease in fair value during the year contracts realized or cash settled fair value at december  the fair value of contracts maturing in each of the next four years and thereafter are shown below in millions thereafter total prices actively quoted 
prices provided by other external sources priced based on models and other valuation methods 
net price risk management assets 
credit risk in conducting our operations  we regularly transact business with a broad range of entities and a wide variety of end users  energy merchants  producers and financial institutions 
credit risk is measured by the loss we would record if our counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations less the value of any collateral held 
we have established policies  systems and controls to manage our exposure to credit risk 
this infrastructure allows us to assess counterparty creditworthiness  monitor credit exposures  stress test the portfolio to quantify future potential credit exposures and catalogue collateral received by the company 
in addition  to enhance the ongoing management of credit exposure  we have used master netting agreements whenever possible 
master netting agreements enable us to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty 
in situations where the credit quality of counterparties has deteriorated to certain levels  we will assert our contractual rights to minimize our exposures by requesting collateral against these obligations 
a natural result of our prior business strategy is the concentration of energy sector credit risk 
factors affecting this industry segment will affect the general credit quality of our portfolio both positively and negatively 
the result of energy industry downgrades of certain companies with significant energy merchant activity has reduced the overall credit quality of our exposures in general 
the following table details our credit exposures at december   associated with our forward positions within our trading portfolio and our billed receivables excluding tariff customers  netted by counterparty where master netting agreements exist and by collateral to the extent any is held 
in millions investment grade non investment grade total utilities and merchants financial institutions oil and gas producers 

commercial and industrial 

total a majority of the customers in our continuing electric and gas utilities businesses are billed under jurisdictional tariffs in the states in which we operate 
we are obligated to provide service to all of our electric and gas customers within their respective franchised territories 
credit risk is managed by credit and collection policies that are consistent with state regulatory requirements 
see pages and under business for a breakout of our utility customers by type 
currency rate exposure we have substantially wound down our united kingdom and canadian merchant trading businesses  which are included in our merchant services segment  and have sold our international utility businesses in canada  australia  new zealand and the united kingdom 
our remaining currency rate exposure relates only to approximately million of cash held in foreign countries  a limited trading portfolio in canada and the resolution of outstanding tax obligations and receivables 
interest rate exposure we have approximately million in unhedged variable rate financial obligations 
a basis point change in the variable rate financial instruments would affect net income by approximately million
