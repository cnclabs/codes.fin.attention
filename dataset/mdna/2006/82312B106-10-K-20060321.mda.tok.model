restatement of financial results the company s financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and  including the beginning retained earnings for the year ended december   all quarters in and the first three quarters of the year ended december   have been restated to correct errors relating to the company s accounting for operating leases

 accounting for leases and fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
historically  the company has not assumed the exercise of available renewal options in accounting for operating leases 
the company has operating leases  primarily for cell sites owned by third parties  land leases for towers owned by the company and leases with third parties for space on the company s towers that have escalating rentals during the initial lease term and during succeeding optional renewal periods 
in light of the company s investment in each site  including acquisition costs and leasehold improvements  the company determined that the exercise of certain renewal options was reasonably assured at the inception of the leases 
accordingly  the company will correct its accounting to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
where the company is the lessor  it will recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the current term of the lease 
the impact of these restatements to the company s statements of income for the years ended december  and december  was a decrease to net income of million for both years 
the impact associated with correcting the company s accounting for operating leases was an increase to lease expense of million reflected in cost of goods and services for both years 
the restatements also impacted the consolidated balance sheet lines for deferred charges and other assets  net  deferred income taxes  deferred lease payable and retained earnings 
for the years ended december  and  the company s consolidated statements of shareholders equity and comprehensive income were impacted by the restatement adjustments by a decrease in net income of million for both years  as well as a decrease to retained earnings of million as of december  the adjustments do not affect historical net cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  future cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases

critical accounting policies the company relies on the use of estimates and makes assumptions that affect its financial condition and operating results 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results and trends as well as the company s forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
the most critical accounting policies that materially affect the company s results of operations include the following allowance for doubtful accounts estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policies  and the analysis of the accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these estimates  the company compares historical write offs in relation to the estimated period in which the subscriber was originally billed 
the company also looks at the historical average length of time that elapses between the original billing date and the date of write off and the financial position of its larger customers in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
from this information  the company assigns specific amounts to the aging categories 
the company provides an allowance for substantially all receivables over days old 
the allowance for doubtful accounts balance as of december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts is not adequate  it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
the company also reviews current trends in the credit quality of the subscriber bases in its various businesses and periodically changes its credit policies 
as of december   the sprint nextel pcs subscriber base in the company s market area consisted of sub prime credit quality subscribers compared to at december   which represented an improvement in the credit quality of the subscribers of 
since the fourth quarter of  the company has  several times  adopted less restrictive credit criteria in order to evaluate the impact of such criteria on sales performance 
this policy change has generated additional activations and is being closely monitored 
although the credit policy change could result in additional bad debt in the future  management believes that the added revenues attributable to the change offset the bad debt risk 
the company exercises exclusive control in setting credit policy parameters for receivables associated with services provided on a more localized basis 
historically  there have been limited losses generated from the non pcs revenue streams 
prior to  the company had not faced significant write offs of inter carrier accounts  but due to the telecommunication industry down turn in  the company experienced write offs in this area of the business totaling million in  due to bankruptcy filings of several significant telecommunications companies 
in and  the inter carrier segment of the business improved and the company recovered thousand and thousand  respectively  of bad debt from the sale of certain accounts that were previously written off 
the following table shows bad debt expense  net of recoveries  for the three year period ended december  year ended december  in thousands pcs subscribers interexchange carriers other subscribers and entities total bad debt expense the increase in bad debt expense in other subscribers and entities was primarily due to the ntc operations  which were purchased november  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized by the company based on the various types of transactions generating the revenue 
for services  revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
for equipment sales  revenue is recognized when the sales transaction is complete 
nonrefundable pcs activation fees and the portion of the activation costs deemed to be direct costs of acquiring new customers primarily activation costs and credit analysis costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship of months in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
effective july   the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple element deliverables 
the eitf guidance addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve multiple revenue generating activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
in applying this guidance  separate contracts with the same party  entered into at or near the same time  are presumed to be a bundled transaction  and the consideration is measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative fair values 
the adoption of eitf has required evaluation of each arrangement entered into by the company for each sales channel 
the company will continue to monitor arrangements with its sales channels to determine if any changes in revenue recognition would need to be made in the future 
the adoption of eitf has resulted in substantially all of the activation fee revenue generated from company owned retail stores and associated direct costs being recognized at the time the related wireless handset is sold and is classified as equipment revenue and cost of goods and services  respectively 
upon adoption of eitf  previously deferred revenues and costs continue to be amortized over the remaining estimated life of a subscriber  not to exceed months 
revenue and costs for activations at other retail locations continue to be deferred and amortized over their estimated lives as prescribed by sab the adoption of eitf had the effect of increasing equipment revenue by thousand and increasing costs of activation by thousand in the year ended december   which otherwise would have been deferred and amortized 
the amounts of deferred revenue under sab at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the deferred costs at december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets generated on a state by state basis from net operating losses apportioned to that state 
management uses a more likely than not threshold to make that determination if a valuation allowance is warranted for tax assets in each state 
as a result of the evaluation of the tax assets  the company has established a valuation allowance against the tax assets 
for  the company s valuation allowance decreased million due to the improved operating performance of the company s pcs segment 
the valuation allowance has been eliminated as of december  management will evaluate the effective rate of taxes based on apportionment factors  the company s operating results  and the various state income tax rates 
currently  management anticipates that the future effective income tax rate will be approximately leases the company accounts for operating leases following the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
in light of the company s investment in each site  including acquisition costs and leasehold improvements  the company includes the exercise of certain renewal options in the recording of operating leases 
the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and renewal periods that are reasonably assured at the inception of the lease 
where the company is the lessor  the company recognizes revenue on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the lease 
other the company does not have any unrecorded off balance sheet transactions or arrangements  however  the company has commitments under operating leases and is subject to certain capital calls under one of its investments

although growth in new housing starts in the company s local telephone area resulted in a net increase of access lines during  the trend over past periods has been a decline in subscribers  principally due to consumer migration to wireless and dsl services from traditional telephone services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates on instruments held for other than trading purposes 
the company s interest rate risk involves three components 
the first component is outstanding debt with variable rates 
as of december   the company s variable rate debt balance was million 
the company s interest rate risk on the variable rate debt is thousand based on a increase in the interest rate 
the company s remaining debt has fixed rates through maturity 
a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the company s total debt by approximately million  while the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt was approximately million as of december  the second component of interest rate risk consists of temporary excess cash  which is primarily invested in overnight repurchase agreements and treasury bills with a maturity of less than days 
the cash is currently invested in short term investment vehicles that have limited interest rate risk 
management continues to evaluate the most beneficial use of these funds 
the third component of interest rate risk is marked increases in interest rates that may adversely affect the rate at which the company may borrow funds for growth in the future 
management does not believe that this risk is currently significant because the company s existing sources of liquidity are adequate to provide cash for operations  payment of debt and near term capital projects 
management does not view market risk as having a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although future results could be adversely affected if interest rates were to increase significantly for an extended period and the company were to require external financing 
since the company has no investments in publicly traded stock as of december   there is currently no risk related to the company s available for sale securities 
general economic conditions affected by regulatory changes  competition or other external influences may pose a higher risk to the company s overall results 
as of december   the company has million invested in privately held companies directly or through investments with portfolio managers 
most of the companies are in an early stage of development and significant increases in interest rates could have an adverse impact on their results  ability to raise capital and viability 
the company s market risk is limited to the funds previously invested and an additional million committed under contracts the company has signed with portfolio managers
