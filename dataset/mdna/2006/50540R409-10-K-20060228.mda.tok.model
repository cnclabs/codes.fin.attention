item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during  the company continued to strengthen its financial performance through the implementation of the company s strategic plan and the expansion of its national platform in routine testing 
this plan continues to provide growth opportunities for the company by building a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies primarily through internal development efforts  acquisitions and technology licensing activities 
the company believes future performance will be positively affected by several factors the expansion of higher value genomic tests such as cystic fibrosis  hcv and hiv genotyping  along with the continued growth of hiv viral load and hpv testing  transition to cytyc s thinprep imaging system  continued progress with existing licensing and business relationships such as exact sciences  atherotech  liposcience  and biopredictive  the company s ongoing business acquisition strategy  and growing demand for genomic testing creating a positive shift in test mix toward higher value testing 
continued development of genomic  esoteric  and anatomic pathology services the company s acquisitions of dianon  us labs  and esoterix position the company as the leading provider of cancer and specialty testing in the united states 
at the end of december approximately percent of the company s revenues are in the genomic  esoteric  and anatomic pathology categories 
prior to the acquisition of dianon  only percent of the company s revenues were derived from these testing categories 
in addition to greater revenue and earnings potential  these acquisitions provide the company the opportunity to reassess the cost structure of our entire organization to eliminate any redundant functions and costs wherever they may exist 
the company s third quarter restructuring marks the beginning of the implementation of these integration efforts 
in connection with these acquisitions  the company expects to ultimately achieve cost reductions of approximately thirty million dollars on a pre tax basis over time compared to the current run rate 
cytyc thinprep imaging system the acceptance of the cytyc thinprep imaging system continues to accelerate as more physicians become aware of this service and the benefits that it provides to them and to their patients 
this new service offers both enhanced quality to clients and their patients as well as enhanced efficiency to the company s labs 
by the end of the fourth quarter  the thinprep imaging system was being requested for approximately percent of all liquid based pap smears ordered  up from approximately percent at the end of the first quarter 
on an annualized run rate basis  this means that the company is now performing approximately million imaged guided pap tests 
this significant adoption rate clearly indicates that physicians recognize the benefits of this pap screening technology advancement 
managed care the company s growth is fueled not only by the introduction of new testing capabilities  but also by expanding and strengthening relationships with managed care partners 
a major driver of volume growth this year is a result of managed care relationships 
effective october   the company was awarded the exclusive national provider contract for wellpoint s ppo in the entire state of georgia 
additionally  the company was awarded the exclusive national lab provider contract for the wellpoint hmo and ppo fee for service plans in nevada effective october  during  the company continued to strengthen relationships with its national managed care partners through three major initiatives 
first  by helping managed care companies understand how the company can help reduce their overall laboratory spending while still allowing for fair payment for the services that the company provides 
control of leakage the amount of work performed and billed by non contracted providers remains a major area of cost reduction opportunity for managed care companies 
second  by providing managed care companies with unique scientific capabilities both in traditional clinical and anatomic pathology services  and in break through areas such as wellness 
third  by bringing unique connectivity and information aggregation and analysis solutions to our managed care partners 
seasonality the majority of the company s testing volume is dependent on patient visits to doctor s offices and other providers of health care 
volume of testing generally declines during the year end holiday periods and other major holidays 
in addition  volume declines due to inclement weather may reduce net revenues and cash flows 
therefore  comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year

new accounting pronouncements in december the financial standards accounting board fasb issued fas r  share based payment revised 
this statement is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the company currently estimates the adoption to impact net income by approximately  net of tax 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this statement does not address the accounting for employee share ownership plans  which are subject to aicpa statement of position  employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
in march   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the company does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  which is effective for periods beginning after december  this statement replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes apb and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
apb previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including  in net income of the period of the change  the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the company does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this statement amends the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
that statement is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the company has not historically entered into a significant level of nonmonetary transactions and therefore does not expect that this standard will impact its financial position or results unless nonmonetary transactions are utilized in the future 
this statement is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
the company s critical accounting policies arise in conjunction with the following allowances for doubtful accounts pension expense accruals for self insurance reserves income tax expense allowance for doubtful accounts revenue is recognized for services rendered when test results are reported to the ordering physician and the testing process is complete 
the company s sales are generally billed to three types of payers clients  patients and third parties  such as managed care companies  medicare and medicaid 
for clients  sales are recorded on a fee for service basis at the company s client list price  less any negotiated discount 
patient sales are recorded at the company s patient fee schedule  net of any discounts negotiated with physicians on behalf of their patients 
the company bills third party payers in two ways fee for service and capitated agreements 
fee for service third party payers are billed at the company s patient fee schedule amount  and third party revenue is recorded net of contractual discounts 
these discounts are recorded at the transaction level at the time of sale based on a fee schedule that is maintained for each third party payer 
the majority of the company s third party sales are recorded using an actual or contracted fee schedule at the time of sale 
for the remaining third party sales  estimated fee schedules are maintained for each payer 
adjustments to the estimated payment amounts are recorded at the time of final collection and settlement of each transaction as an adjustment to revenue 
these adjustments are not material to the company s results of operations in any period presented 
the company periodically adjusts these estimated fee schedules based upon historical payment trends 
under capitated agreements with managed care companies  the company recognizes revenue based on a negotiated monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the number or costs of services performed 
the company has a formal process to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on the period of time they have been outstanding 
bad debt expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level 
the company s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves judgment  and considers such factors as the age of the underlying receivables  historical and projected collection experience  and other external factors that could affect the collectibility of its receivables 
accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the company s write off policy eg when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
in the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance  accounts are progressively reserved based on the historical timing of cash collections relative to their respective aging categories within the company s receivables 
these collection and reserve processes  along with the close monitoring of the billing process  help reduce the risks of material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection or reimbursement experience 
the following table presents the percentage of the company s net accounts receivable outstanding by aging category at december  and days outstanding over pension expense substantially all employees of the company are covered by a defined benefit retirement plan the company plan 
the benefits to be paid under the company plan are based on years of credited service and compensation earned while an employee of labcorp 
the company has a second defined benefit plan which covers its senior management group and provides for additional benefits  due in part to limitations on benefits and pay imposed on the company plan under the employee retirement income security act of the company s net pension cost is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in accounting for the defined benefit plans were a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets as of december  discount rate the company works with its independent actuary to develop a discount rate assumption used to value the benefit obligations of its retirement plans 
the company follows paragraph of financial accounting standard in developing this rate 
the company s actuary obtains information on high quality corporate aa rating or higher bonds from a nationally recognized credit rating agency 
these bonds are then reviewed and outliers are discarded 
the results of the actuary s discount rate analysis are then reviewed by the company and a final decision on the discount rate assumption is made by the company 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of million 
return on plan assets in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption  the company reviews its asset allocation and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of million 
current year net pension cost was million  a decrease of million from our actuaries have estimated that net pension cost will be higher by approximately million than net pension cost 
the decrease in the discount rate assumption during fiscal is a primary reason for this expected increase in net pension cost for further information on our defined benefit retirement plan is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for self insurance reserves accruals for self insurance reserves including workers compensation  auto and employee medical are determined based on historical payment trends and claims history  along with current and estimated future economic conditions 
the company is self insured for professional liability claims arising in the normal course of business  generally related to the testing and reporting of laboratory test results 
the company records an accrual for such claims payable and claims incurred but not reported based on an actuarial assessment of the accrual driven by frequency and amounts of claims  which is performed at least annually 
while management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent  they are by their very nature  estimates of amounts that will depend on future events 
accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s audit committee periodically reviews the company s significant accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of significant accounting policies 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not
