item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation is a global manufacturer and marketer of power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement products  and technology based fastening systems 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems with these business segments comprising   and  respectively  of the corporation s sales in the corporation markets its products and services in over countries 
during  approximately   and of its sales were made to customers in the united states  in europe including the united kingdom  and in other geographic regions  respectively 
the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments are subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which they operate as well as the strength of the retail economies 
the fastening and assembly systems segment is also subject to general economic conditions in the countries in which it operates as well as to automotive and industrial demand 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   compared to net earnings of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report  net earnings for the year ended december   included a 
million loss on the sale of discontinued operations 
net earnings for the year ended december   included a million gain on the sale of discontinued operations 
the corporation reported net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december   as compared to net earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  total consolidated sales of  million for the year ended december   increased by over the prior year s level 
of that increase  was attributable to an increase in unit volume of existing businesses  was attributable to sales of acquired businesses  and was attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  offset by attributable to the negative effect of pricing actions 
in this management s discussion and analysis  the corporation has attempted to differentiate between sales of its existing or legacy businesses and sales of acquired businesses 
that differentiation includes sales of businesses where year to year comparability exists in the category of existing or legacy businesses 
for example  the sales of the masterfix business  acquired in march  are included in acquired businesses for the first three months of and in existing or legacy businesses for the final nine months of in addition  the sales of the porter cable and delta tools group also referred to herein as the tools group  acquired in the fourth quarter of  are included in acquired businesses for the first nine months of and in existing or legacy businesses for the final three months of operating income for the year ended december   increased to million  or of sales  from million  or of sales  in due to the ongoing integration of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group into its legacy businesses  the corporation has been required to use judgment in its determination of the individual profit contributions of the acquired porter cable and delta tools group and of its legacy businesses 
the corporation estimates that operating income as a percentage of sales increased approximately basis points in the corporation s legacy businesses during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year s level  but that increase was offset by the lower margin tools group 
the increase in operating income as a percentage of sales during the year ended december   was due to the positive effects of restructuring and other productivity initiatives  favorable product mix  and the leverage of fixed costs over a higher sales base  which offset higher commodity costs and the negative impact of pricing 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december   increased by million over the level to million 
in addition to the improvements in operating income described above  earnings from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december   benefited from a favorable million settlement of environmental and product liability coverage litigation with an insurer that is included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 
consolidated income tax expense of million and million was recognized on the corporation s earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million and million for and  respectively 
the corporation s effective tax rate was for  compared to an effective tax rate of for the increase in the corporation s effective tax rate in was due to the incremental tax expense of million associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of and to the tax effects million of the million of income recognized upon settlement of environmental and product liability coverage litigation with an insurer 
in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  the corporation generally attempts to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
sales the following chart provides an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume existing a unit volume acquired b price currency change in total sales a represents change in unit volume for businesses where year to year comparability exists 
b represents change in unit volume for businesses that were acquired and were not included in prior period results 
total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
excluding the incremental effects of the masterfix business for the first three months of and of the porter cable and delta tools group business for the first nine months of  total unit volume increased by during the year ended december  that increase was primarily driven by growth in the corporation s professional power tools and plumbing products businesses in the united states 
unit volume of acquired businesses contributed to the sales growth for over the levels

consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in  compared to in and in selling  general  and administrative expenses in increased by million over the level 
the effects of acquired businesses and foreign currency translation accounted for approximately two thirds of that increase  with the remainder principally resulting from additional sales related expenses associated with the higher level of sales experienced during the reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales during as compared to the level was principally due to the impact of the tools group acquisition due to the lower expenses of this business and the leverage of expenses over a higher sales base in the corporation s legacy businesses 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses in increased by million over the level 
the incremental expenses of the acquired businesses and the effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately and of that increase  respectively 
higher promotional  marketing  and research and development expenses  particularly in the north american power tools and accessories business  higher transportation and distribution expenses to support the increased sales level  and higher corporate expenses driven by expenses related to stock based compensation and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act accounted for much of the remaining increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in over the level 
consolidated net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in net interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily the result of both higher borrowing levels associated with the october issuance of million of senior notes and higher interest rates  including the effects of higher prevailing us interest rates on the corporation s foreign currency hedging activities 
the lower net interest expense in  as compared to  was primarily the result of higher interest income associated with the corporation s foreign cash investment activities in  coupled with lower borrowing levels

net loss earnings of the discontinued european security hardware business were 
million per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december   million 
per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december   and million 
per share on a diluted basis for the year ended december  earnings from discontinued operations include a pre tax restructuring reversal of 
million for the year ended december  restructuring actions the corporation is committed to continuous productivity improvement and continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce fixed costs  simplify or improve processes  and eliminate excess capacity 
a tabular summary of restructuring activity during the three years ended december   is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the corporation recognized million of pre tax restructuring and exit costs related to actions taken in its power tools and accessories segment 
the restructuring actions taken in principally reflected severance benefits 
the million charge recognized during was offset  however  by the reversal of million of severance accruals established as part of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation formulated a restructuring plan designed to reduce its manufacturing footprint  variable production costs  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the following discussion excludes the restructuring actions relating to the discontinued european security hardware business 
earnings from discontinued operations include pre tax restructuring reversals of 
million for the year ended december  during  the corporation commenced the final phase of its restructuring plan and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge associated with that plan of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and million  representing the excess of proceeds received on the sale of long lived assets  written down as part of restructuring actions  over their adjusted carrying values 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of the corporation recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment as a result of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in principally reflected actions relating to the power tools and accessories segment to reduce its manufacturing cost base as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses through the elimination of administrative positions 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the power tools and accessories segment include the closure of one facility in the united states and the transfer of certain additional power tool production from a facility in the united states to a low cost facility in mexico 
the restructuring charge provided for actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses  principally in europe  and to a lesser extent in the united states  principally reducing headcount 
as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the severance benefits accrual  included in the million pre tax restructuring charge taken in  related to the elimination of approximately  positions in high cost manufacturing locations and in certain administrative positions 
the corporation estimates that  as a result of increases in manufacturing employee headcount in low cost locations  approximately  replacement positions were filled  yielding a net total of positions eliminated as a result of the restructuring actions 
during  the corporation substantially completed the execution of the restructuring plan that was formulated in the fourth quarter of and the closure of the manufacturing facility in its hardware and home improvement segment as a result of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser 
in addition to the recognition of restructuring and exit costs  the corporation also recognized related expenses  incremental to the cost of the underlying restructuring actions  that do not qualify as restructuring or exit costs under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states restructuring related expenses 
those restructuring related expenses included items directly related to the underlying restructuring actions that benefited on going operations  such as costs associated with the transfer of equipment 
operating results for the years ended december  and  included approximately million of restructuring related expenses in both years 
the corporation realized benefits of approximately million and million in and  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
those benefits resulted in a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and a reduction in selling  general  and administrative expenses of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the corporation expects that pre tax savings associated with the restructuring actions related to the integration of baldwin and weiser into its existing security hardware business will benefit results by approximately million  net of restructuring related expenses 
the corporation expects that  of those incremental pre tax savings in  approximately will benefit gross margin and will be realized through a reduction of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the corporation expects that incremental pre tax savings associated with the integration of the tools group will benefit results by approximately million in  net of integration related expenses 
the corporation expects that  of those incremental pre tax savings in  approximately will benefit gross margin and will be realized through a reduction of selling  general  and administrative expenses 
ultimate savings realized from restructuring actions may be mitigated by such factors as economic weakness and competitive pressures  as well as decisions to increase costs in areas such as promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed 
as previously indicated  the pre tax restructuring charges recognized in and  of and million  respectively  were net of reversals in and of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required and proceeds received in excess of the adjusted carrying value of long lived assets in the aggregate of million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the severance component of restructuring reserves previously established related to i actual attrition factors that differed from those initially estimated  ii more cost effective methods of severing employment that became probable  typically based on negotiations with trade unions or local government institutions  and iii amendments to the initial plan that were approved by the appropriate level of management  based primarily on changes in market conditions that dictated a modification to the intended course of action 
during and  none of the adjustments to the severance obligations recorded in connection with restructuring actions was individually significant 
adjustments to the asset write down component of restructuring reserves previously established related to the receipt of proceeds in excess of adjusted carrying values of fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with the restructuring actions 
adjustments to the other charge component of restructuring reserves previously established principally related to settlement of operating lease commitments at amounts less than initially estimated or the corporation s ability to sublease certain facilities exited as part of the restructuring actions 
asset write downs taken as part of the restructuring charge included land  buildings  and manufacturing equipment 
the carrying values of land and buildings to be sold were written down to their estimated fair values  generally based upon third party offers  less disposal costs 
the carrying values of manufacturing equipment and furniture and fixtures were written down to their fair value based upon estimated salvage values  which generally were negligible  less disposal cost 
in addition to the previously discussed restructuring actions  prior to the date of the acquisition of baldwin and weiser and during the fourth quarter of  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure these businesses as well as to integrate these businesses into the existing security hardware business included in the corporation s hardware and home improvement segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring actions relating to the acquired businesses of million 
these actions principally reflected severance benefits associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of an acquired administration and distribution facility 
these restructuring actions were completed in also  prior to the date of the acquisition of the porter cable and delta tools group and during the fourth quarter of  the corporation identified opportunities to restructure these businesses as well as to integrate these businesses into its existing power tools and accessories segment 
subsequent to the acquisition  the corporation approved restructuring actions relating to the acquired business of million 
these actions principally reflected severance costs associated with administrative and manufacturing actions related to the acquired businesses  including the closure of three manufacturing facilities  and lease and other contractual obligations for which no future benefit will be realized 
certain of these restructuring actions commenced in and the remainder commenced in the corporation expects that these restructuring actions will be completed by the end of hedging activities the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  australian dollar  mexican peso  czech koruna  and brazilian real 
through its foreign currency activities  the corporation seeks to reduce the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of products manufactured in a currency different from that of the selling subsidiary will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
from time to time  currencies may strengthen or weaken in countries in which the corporation sells or manufactures its product 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impacts of any future currency movements  there is no assurance that such movements will not adversely affect the corporation 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside of the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity  decreased stockholders equity by million  compared to an increase of million in the materials used in the manufacturing of the corporation s products  which include certain components and raw materials  are subject to price volatility 
these component parts and raw materials are principally subject to market risk associated with changes in the price of aluminum  copper  steel  resins  and zinc 
the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market  and the majority is available through multiple sources 
while future movements in prices of raw materials and component parts are uncertain  the corporation uses a variety of methods  including established supply arrangements  purchase of component parts and raw materials for future delivery  and supplier price commitments  to address this risk 
in addition  the corporation utilizes derivatives to manage its risk to changes in the prices of certain commodities 
as of december   no commodity hedges were outstanding 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may elect to manage its interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair value of its indebtedness  or the cash flows of its indebtedness  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  at december   average long term debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information as of december   about the corporation s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps 
weighted average variable rates are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of the reset dates 
the cash flows of these instruments are denominated in a variety of currencies 
unless otherwise indicated  the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the corporation s reporting currency  as of december  principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity dates us dollars in millions thereafter total fair value assets liabilities liabilities short term borrowings variable rate other currencies average interest rate long term debt fixed rate us dollars 

average interest rate interest rate derivatives fixed to variable rate interest rate swaps us dollars average pay rate a average receive rate a the average pay rate is based upon month forward libor  except for million in notional principal amount which matures in and thereafter and is based upon month forward libor 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity as discussed above  the corporation is exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the corporation has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts 
the corporation estimated the effect on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform strengthening in the value of the united states dollar 
the corporation estimated that this would have the effects of reducing gross profits for by approximately million 
the corporation also estimated the effects on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar would have the effect of increasing gross profits 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect higher exchange rates  compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the corporation believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled  million at december  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rates of salary increase  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
these assumptions are updated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each year 
the corporation considers current market conditions  including interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation develops the discount rates by considering the yields available on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the related benefit obligation 
the corporation s discount rate for united states defined benefit pension plans was and at december  and  respectively 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors  which include its targeted asset allocation percentages  historic returns  and expected future returns 
the corporation s expected long term rate of return assumption for united states defined benefit plans for and is 
the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets referred to as the market related value of assets 
the corporation s aggregate fair value of plan assets exceeded the market related value of assets by approximately million as of the measurement date 
differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market related value on a straight line basis over a five year period 
also  gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and from differences between assumptions and actual experience except those differences being amortized to the market related value of assets are amortized over the expected remaining service period of active plan participants or  for retired participants  the average remaining life expectancy  to the extent that such amounts exceed ten percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefit costs in will exceed the costs recognized in by approximately million 
this increase is principally attributable to two factors the effect of amortization of certain actuarial losses and a reduction in the market related value of pension plan assets as compared to the prior year 
as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not probable 
further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized 
any insurance recoveries  if realized in future periods  could have a favorable impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations in the periods realized 
the corporation is also subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the corporation s financial statements or tax returns 
additionally  the corporation is subject to periodic examinations by taxing authorities in many countries 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
during  the corporation received notices of proposed adjustments from the united states internal revenue service irs in connection with audits of the tax years through the principal adjustment proposed by the irs consists of the disallowance of a capital loss deduction taken in the corporation s tax returns and interest on the deficiency 
prior to receiving the notices of proposed adjustments from the irs  the corporation filed a petition against the irs in the federal district court of maryland the court seeking refunds for a carryback of a portion of the aforementioned capital loss deduction 
the irs subsequently filed a counterclaim to the corporation s petition 
in october  the court granted the corporation s motion for summary judgment on its complaint against the irs and dismissed the irs counter claim 
in its opinion  the court ruled in the corporation s favor that the capital losses cannot be disallowed by the irs 
in december  the irs appealed the court s decision in favor of the corporation to the united states circuit court of appeals for the fourth circuit the fourth circuit 
in february  the fourth circuit issued its decision  deciding two of three issues in the corporation s favor and remanding the third issue for trial in the court 
the corporation intends to vigorously dispute the position taken by the irs in this matter 
the corporation has provided adequate reserves in the event that the irs prevails in its disallowance of the previously described capital loss and the imposition of related interest 
should the irs prevail in its disallowance of the capital loss deduction and the imposition of related interest  it would result in a cash outflow of approximately million 
if the corporation prevails  it would result in the corporation receiving a refund of taxes previously paid of approximately million  plus interest 
the corporation believes that any such outflow or inflow is unlikely to occur until or later

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in over was primarily the result of increased earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of the million settlement of environmental and product liability coverage litigation with an insurer  which was partially offset by increased cash usage associated with working capital and income taxes 
the corporation will be required to make income tax payments associated with the repatriation of previously unremitted foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of in the first quarter of increases in inventories and receivables associated with the higher level of sales and to achieve higher service levels exceeded the increase in accrued liabilities associated with higher sales and earnings levels in as compared to as part of its capital management  the corporation reviews certain working capital metrics

the number of days sales outstanding as of december   increased slightly from the number of days sales outstanding as of december  average inventory turns as of december   approximated average inventory turns as of december  investing activities for the year ended december  used cash of million compared to million of cash used in this decrease in cash used was primarily the result of acquisition and divestiture activity 
in  cash proceeds from divesture and acquisition activity totaled million  including million associated with the sale of flex  million associated with the sale of discontinued operations  and million of cash received during associated with the preliminary adjustment to the purchase price of the porter cable and delta tools group 
in  cash used for acquisition and divestiture activity totaled million  including million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of the porter cable and delta tools group and million of cash used for other acquisitions including the purchase of masterfix  which was partially offset by million of net proceeds from the sale of two of the discontinued european security hardware businesses 
capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
the corporation anticipates that its capital spending in will approximate million 
financing activities used cash of million in  compared to cash provided of million in the increased use of cash for financing activities primarily resulted from the purchase by the corporation of  shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of million  the repayment of million of preferred stock of a subsidiary  and the increase of the corporation s dividend payments  which increased on a per share basis from 
during to during dividend payments were million and million in and  respectively 
the increased use of cash for financing activities during was offset by the increase in short term borrowings of million associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of and million of proceeds received upon the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
cash provided by financing activities in included million of proceeds  net of discounts and debt issuance costs  received in october upon the issuance of million of senior notes due in cash provided by financing activities in also included million of proceeds received upon the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans

 employer s accounting for pensions  the corporation has recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment at december  as a charge to stockholders equity of million  net of tax 
that charge to stockholders equity did not impact the corporation s compliance with covenants under its borrowing agreements or cash flow 
the corporation s expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by approximately million in over the levels 
the corporation anticipates that the expense recognized relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans in will increase by approximately million over the levels 
that increase is partially attributable to the amortization of previously unrecognized actuarial losses that gave rise to the minimum liability adjustment 
as discussed further in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation does not anticipate that the funding requirements relating to the pension benefit plans in will be material

should the irs prevail in its disallowance of the capital loss deduction and the imposition of related interest  it would result in a cash outflow by the corporation of approximately million 
if the corporation prevails  it would result in the corporation receiving a refund of taxes previously paid of approximately million  plus interest 
the corporation believes that any such outflow or inflow is unlikely to occur until or later
