executive overview at december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total shareholders equity of million 
in  umpqua continued to demonstrate solid financial performance coupled with many significant accomplishments and some challenges  some of which were not necessarily reflected in our operating results 
during the past year  we continued our track record of double digit organic growth that is  excluding growth from acquisitions in loans and deposits 
for  organic loan and deposit growth were both 
maintained exceptional credit quality standards  with net charge offs of only of average loans for the ratio of non performing assets to total assets at december  was  down basis point from year end achieved a increase in basic and diluted earnings per share as compared to increased our cash dividend by from year end  to per quarter  effective in the fourth quarter of our board of directors plans to review the dividend payout on a quarterly basis 
opened new stores in bellevue  washington  and napa  california 
mortgage banking revenue declined by  mostly due to a million net impairment charge to the value of mortgage servicing right portfolio 
this impairment resulted from a decline in mortgage interest rates during the year 
in february  we announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the company to acquire western sierra bancorp and its principal operating subsidiaries  western sierra bank  central california bank  lake community bank and auburn community bank 
the agreement provides for western sierra shareholders to receive shares of the company s common stock for each share of western sierra common stock  giving the acquisition a total value of approximately million 
this transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of upon completion of the acquisition expected in the second quarter of  all western sierra bancorp branches will operate under the umpqua bank name 
the acquisition will add western sierra s complete network of northern california 
table of contents branches  including locations in the sacramento  auburn  lakeport and sonora areas  to our network of northern california  oregon and washington locations  and result in a combined institution with assets of approximately billion 
summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan portfolio to determine the credit quality of the portfolio and the adherence to underwriting standards 
when loans are originated  they are assigned a risk rating that is assessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process 
the risk ratings are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan losses 
during  the bank formed a management all committee  which is responsible for  among other things  regular review of the all methodology  including loss factors  and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the all committee reviews loans that have been placed on non accrual status and approves placing loans on impaired status 
the all committee also approves removing loans that are impaired from impairment and non accrual status 
the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the all process and reviews and approves the all methodology on a quarterly basis 
each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses provided for that group of loans with similar risk rating 
credit loss factors may vary by region based on management s belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region 
the regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired 
potentially impaired loans are referred to the all committee which reviews and approves designating loans as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we recognize this impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
the combination of the risk rating based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan losses 
the bank also maintains an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors 
this unallocated amount generally comprises less than of the allowance 
the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses  the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends 
the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the all and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
management believes that the all was adequate as of december  there is  however  no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the all and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation mortgage servicing rights retained mortgage servicing rights are measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interest retained  based on their relative fair values at the date of the sale 
the subsequent measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized over the expected life of the loan and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
we adopted financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  in accordance with the standard  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer being amortized but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis for the intangible assets with indefinite lives on a quarterly basis and determined that there was no impairment as of december  the valuation is based on discounted cash flows or observable market prices on a segment basis 
a or decrease in market price is not expected to result in an impairment 
if impairment was deemed to exist  a write down of the asset would occur with a charge to earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees 
for the company  this standard became effective on january  the company does not expect the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on earnings per share will be materially different from the current fair value pro forma disclosure contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  under the modified prospective method which means any awards that are granted or modified after the date of adoption will be measured and accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the unvested portion of previously granted awards will continue to be accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  except that the compensation expense associated with the unvested portions will be recognized in the statement of income 
in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force regarding issue the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf 
the consensus provided guidance for determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired and established disclosure requirements for investments with unrealized losses 
the guidance was effective for periods beginning after june  on september   the fasb deferred the implementation of the recognition criteria of eitf in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp nullifies certain requirements of issue based on the clarification provided in fsp fas and fas  the amount of any other than temporary impairment that needs to be recognized will continue to be dependent on market conditions  the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances relative to an investee and an entity s intent and ability to hold the impaired investment at the time of the valuation 
fsp fas and fas are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this fsp is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans and debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop addresses the accounting for acquired loans that show evidence of having deteriorated in terms of credit quality since their origination and for which a loss is deemed probable of occurring 
sop requires acquired loans to be recorded at their fair value  defined as the present value of future cash flows including interest income  to be recognized over the life of the loan 
sop prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan loss on certain acquired loans within its scope considered in the future cash flows assessment 
sop was effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  and has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations overview for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december   which excludes the after tax operating results from and gain on the sale of our merchant bankcard portfolio  was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis compared to million or per diluted share for the year ended december  additional information on discontinued operations is provided under the heading discontinued operations below 
the improvement in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for is principally attributable to improved net interest income  offset by increased operating expenses 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis over income from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis 
the improvement in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for was principally attributable to improved net interest income  offset in part by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and increased operating expenses 
we completed the acquisition of humboldt on july   and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on july  we incur significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of merger related expenses  net of tax 
we define operating income as income before merger related expenses  net of tax  and we calculate operating income per diluted share by dividing operating earnings by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per share see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating income and operating income per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income and operating income per share to net income and net income per share for years ended december   and reconciliation of operating income to net income years ended december  in thousands  except per shae data net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income per diluted share net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation the following table presents the returns on average assets  average shareholders equity and average tangible shareholders equity for the years ended december   and for each of the years presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income and income from continuing operations  and operating income as shown in the table above 
our return on average shareholders equity is negatively impacted as the result of capital required to support goodwill under bank regulatory guidelines 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible shareholders equity 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity less average intangible assets 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average shareholders equity

the review concluded that shareholder value would be maximized  on a risk adjusted basis  through a sale of the portfolio to a third party 
in december  the bank sold its merchant bankcard portfolio to a third party for million in cash  resulting in a gain on sale after selling costs and related expenses of million  or million after tax 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating results related to the merchant bankcard portfolio including the gain on sale have been reclassified as income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented 
we retained no ongoing liability related to the portfolio subsequent to the sale and entered into an agreement whereby we will refer all merchant applications exclusively to the buyer for a period of seven years 
in consideration for the referrals  we will receive remuneration for each accepted application and an on going royalty based on a percentage of net revenue generated by the account as defined in the agreement 
we do not expect the referral revenue will have a material impact on our non interest income 
in  we recognized no revenue related to the merchant bankcard portfolio 
the revenue related to the merchant bankcard portfolio was  and million  respectively  in and as a result of the sale  we will no longer have the benefit of this revenue stream 
since  for the year ended december   merchant bankcard revenue comprised only about of total non interest income  the loss of revenue did not have a material impact on our results of operations in additional information on discontinued operations is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 

table of contents net interest income net interest income is the largest source of our operating income 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million  or over this increase is attributable to growth in outstanding average interest earning assets offset by growth in interest bearing liabilities over  primarily due to the humboldt merger  which was completed on july  the fair value of interest earning assets acquired on that date totaled billion  and interest bearing liabilities totaled million 
the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  an increase of basis points as compared to this increase is due to growth in non interest bearing deposits as well as increased yield on interest earning assets 
the increased yield on interest earning assets  primarily from short term interest rate increases  was somewhat offset by a corresponding increase in our cost of interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in volume  as well as changes in the yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds  or rates

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation investment securities the composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
the investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements and collateral for certain public funds deposits 
total investment securities as of december  were million  as compared to million at december  this decrease is principally attributable to maturities and sale of million in investment securities and decrease in fair market value of available for sale securities of million  offset by the purchase of million in investment securities in investment securities for each of the last three years is as follows summary of investment securities as of december  in thousands available for sale us treasury and agencies mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations obligations of states and political subdivisions other investment securities held to maturity obligations of states and political subdivisions other investment securities the following table presents information regarding the amortized cost  fair value  average yield and maturity structure of the investment portfolio at december  investment securities composition december  amortized fair average in thousands cost value yield us treasury and agencies one year or less one to five years obligations of states and political subdivisions one year or less one to five years five to ten years over ten years serial maturities other investment securities total securities weighted average yields are stated on a federal tax equivalent basis of

table of contents the mortgage related securities in serial maturities in the table above include both pooled mortgage backed issues and high quality collaterized mortgage obligation structures  with an average duration of three years 
these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile even in the best structures due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the structure of most of the mortgage related securities provides for minimal extension risk in the event of increased market rates 
equity securities in other investment securities in the table above at december  consisted principally of investments in two mutual funds comprised largely of mortgage related securities  although the funds may also invest in us government or agency securities  bank certificates of deposit insured by the fdic or repurchase agreements 
because the bank has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or to maturity  none of the investment securities are considered other than temporarily impaired 
additional information about the investment securities portfolio is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
loans total loans outstanding at december  were billion  an increase of million  or  from year end the growth in loans was principally due to organic loan growth in both the oregon washington and california markets 
the bank provides a wide variety of credit services to its customers  including construction loans  commercial lines of credit  secured and unsecured commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  home equity credit lines  consumer loans and commercial leases

the bank s credit quality group is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
reviews of non performing  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan losses  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses was modified during in connection with the humboldt acquisition 
these modifications did not result in a material adjustment to the allowance for loans losses

non performing loans  which include non accrual loans and accruing loans past due over days totaled million  or of total loans  at december   which represents a significant decline as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  non performing assets  which include non performing loans and foreclosed real estate other real estate owned  totaled million  or of total assets as of december   compared with million  or of total assets as of december  loans are classified as non accrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful generally if they are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
additionally  all loans that are impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for the impairment of a loan  are considered for non accrual status 
these loans will typically remain on non accrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain

we have not identified any other potential problem loans that were not classified as non performing but for which known information about the borrower s financial condition caused management to have concern about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the repayment terms of the loans 
a decline in the economic conditions in our general market areas or other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that loans will not become days or more past due  become impaired or placed on non accrual status  restructured or transferred to other real estate owned in the future

prior to july   our all adequacy model did not allocate any specific component of the all to loss exposure for unfunded commitments 

table of contents also during the third quarter of  we revised our methodology the all model for determining the adequacy of the all 
this was done principally as a result of the humboldt acquisition  which increased our loan portfolio by approximately billion  or 
substantially all of the loans acquired from humboldt were to borrowers in northern california and approximately were secured by real estate  with construction development and commercial real estate representing and  respectively 
although humboldt s underwriting standards were similar to ours  differences did exist for loans acquired 
subsequent to the date the acquisition was completed  all loans were originated in accordance with the bank s underwriting guidelines  policies and procedures 
the level of actual losses  as indicated by the ratio of net charge offs to average loans  declined during as compared to the two previous years and recoveries as a percentage of charge offs reached their highest levels in the past five years 
these factors combined with improving trends in non performing assets resulted in a decreased ratio of provision to average loans as compared to the following table presents a summary of activity in the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc since being established at september  summary of reserve for unfunded commitments activity years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of period reclassification net increase charged to other expenses balance  end of period we believe that the all and ruc at december  are sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit commitments outstanding as of that date  respectively  based on the best information available 
this assessment  based in part on historical levels of net charge offs  loan growth  and a detailed review of the quality of the loan portfolio  involves uncertainty and judgment  therefore  the adequacy of the all and ruc cannot be determined with precision and may be subject to change in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their review warrant such

to the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may become impaired to the extent that the fair value is less than carrying value net of any previously recorded amortization or valuation reserves 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
at december   we had a valuation reserve of million based on the estimated fair value of the servicing portfolio 
the valuation reserve is adjusted on a quarterly basis through adjustments to mortgage banking revenue 
goodwill and core deposit intangible assets at december   we had goodwill and core deposit intangibles of million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at year end this increase in goodwill is attributed to tax adjustments related to the humboldt acquisition 
the goodwill recorded in connection with the humboldt acquisition represented the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the value of humboldt s core deposits  which included all deposits except certificates of deposit 
the value of the core deposits was determined by a third party based on an analysis of the cost differential between the core deposits and alternative funding sources 
we amortize core deposit intangible assets on an accelerated basis over an estimated ten year life 
substantially all of the goodwill is associated with our community banking operations 
we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on a quarterly basis and there were no impairments recorded for the years ended december   or additional information regarding our accounting for goodwill and core deposit intangible assets is included in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below

advances from the federal home loan banks of san francisco fhlb amounted to million of the total and are secured by investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging from to 
approximately million  or  of the fhlb advances mature prior to december  management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding 
additional information regarding term debt is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  and at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over libor 
increases in short term market interest rates during have resulted in increased interest expense for junior subordinated debentures 
although any additional increases in short term market interest rates will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
as of december   million representing the entire issued amount of junior subordinated debentures qualified as tier capital under regulatory capital purposes 
additional information regarding the terms of the junior subordinated debentures  including maturity call dates and interest rates  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation at december   the outstanding balance of federal funds purchased was million at a rate of 
this compared to an outstanding balance of federal funds purchased at december  of million 
the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling million at december  the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with four additional financial institutions totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
availability of the lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility 
these lines are intended to support short term liquidity needs  and the agreements restrict the consecutive day usage 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
in  the bank paid the company million in dividends 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the principal source of cash provided by operating activities was net income 
net cash of million used in investing activities consisted principally of million of net loan growth  purchases of million of investment securities available for sale and million of premises and equipment  offset by sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale of million 
the million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million of net deposit growth  million increase in fed funds purchased  offset by million of financing outflows related to repayment of term loans and million payment of dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we utilize financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers  including loan commitments to extend credit  commitments to extend overdrafts  commitments to originate residential loans and related forward sales commitments  and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee by the customer 
since many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
the following table presents a summary of the bank s commitments and contingent liabilities commitments and contingent liabilities as of december  in thousands commitments to extend credit commitments to extend overdrafts commitments to originate residential loans forward sales commitments standby letters of credit 
table of contents the following table presents a summary of significant contractual obligations extending beyond one year as of december  and maturing as indicated future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than to to more than year years years years total term debt junior subordinated debentures operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual obligations include payments related to employee benefit plans 
additional information about employee benefit plans is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the table above does not include deposit liabilities  interest payments or purchase accounting adjustments related to term debt or junior subordinated debentures 
although we expect the bank s and the company s liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during  increases in market interest rates have resulted in increased competition for bank deposits 
it is possible that our deposit growth for may not be maintained at previous levels due to increased pricing pressure or  in order to generate deposit growth  our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits 
concentrations of credit risk the company grants real estate mortgage  real estate construction  commercial  agricultural and installment loans and leases to customers throughout oregon  washington and california 
in management s judgment  a concentration exists in real estate related loans  which represented approximately and of the company s loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
commercial real estate concentrations are managed to assure wide geographic and business diversity 
although management believes such concentrations to have no more than the normal risk of collectibility  a substantial decline in the economy in general  or a decline in real estate values in the company s primary market areas in particular  could have an adverse impact on the collectibility of these loans 
personal and business income represent the primary source of repayment for a majority of these loans 
the bank recognizes the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions 
accordingly  to prevent excessive exposure to any single correspondent  the bank has established general standards for selecting correspondents as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to any single correspondent 
in addition  the bank has an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations per issuer 
capital resources shareholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase in shareholders equity during was principally due to the retention of million  or approximately  of net income for the year and issuance of common stock under stock plans and related tax benefit of million  partially offset by million of unrealized losses on securities arising during the year

the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
our consolidated tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of  the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i capital plus 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was million at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies 
our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
during the fourth quarter of  umpqua s board of directors approved increasing the quarterly cash dividend rate to from per share in the third quarter of and per share in the second quarter of this increase was made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of  among other things  earnings  regulatory capital levels and expected asset growth 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the supervision and regulation section of part i of this report 
there is no assurance that future cash dividends will be declared or increased 
the following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios dividends declared per share divided by basic earnings per share for the years ended december   and cash dividends and payout ratios dividend declared per share dividend payout ratio our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase plan for up to million shares of common stock 
as of december   a total of million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization  which expires on june  in addition  our stock option plans provide for option holders to pay for the exercise price in part or whole by tendering previously held shares 
although no shares were repurchased in open market transactions during the fourth quarter of  we expect to continue to repurchase additional shares in the future 
the timing and amount of such repurchases will depend upon the market price for our common stock  securities laws restricting repurchases  asset growth  earnings and our capital plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and 
table of contents liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  interest sensitivity gap in thousands by repricing interval non rate months months years over years sensitive total assets temporary investments securities available for sale securities held to maturity trading account assets loans and loans held for sale non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase federal funds purchased term debt junior subordinated debentures non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months

the flattening yield curve in resulted in decreased asset sensitivity from the previous years 
some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected or in the actual level of market interest rates 
a second interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
the table below illustrates the effects of various market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of december  in thousands increase decrease in increase decrease in estimated fair percentage estimated fair percentage value of equity change value of equity change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points the flattening yield curve in resulted in decreased fair value sensitivity from 
table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
