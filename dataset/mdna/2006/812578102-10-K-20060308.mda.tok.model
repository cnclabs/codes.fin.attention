item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  project  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology  and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong 
actual events or results may differ materially 
our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
in evaluating these statements  you should specifically consider various factors  including the risks outlined in item a risk factors and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the sec 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of products and services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess our multiple element revenue arrangements involving upfront payments  license fees and milestone payments received for the delivery of rights or services 
where delivery of the rights or services represent the culmination of a separate earnings process  revenues are recognized when due and collection is reasonably assured 
where the rights or services which represent continuing obligations  revenues are deferred until all of the elements have been delivered or we have verifiable and objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
generally  upfront payments and license fees are recognized ratably over the collaboration research period 
revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
payments for the achievement of substantive milestones by our collaborators are recognized when the milestone is achieved and payments for milestones which are not the result of the achievement of a substantive milestone are recognized ratably over the research period 
we perform certain research and development activities on behalf of collaborative partners 
we generally bill at contractual rates and recognize revenue as the activities are performed  but bill the collaborator monthly  quarterly or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts earned  but not billed to the collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets 
the assessment of these multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized under these agreements 
investments 
our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included as a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income 
to date  we have determined that unrealized losses are not significant and are temporary as to the extent of the decline in both dollars and percentage of cost  and we have the ability and intent to hold the investments until we recover at least substantially all of the cost of the investment 
the fair value of our investments is subject to 
table of contents volatility 
to date  the carrying values of our investments have not been written down due to declines in value because such declines are judged to be other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with manufacturing clinical grade materials and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other direct headcount related costs  third party contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses for drug discovery and research  preclinical studies and for costs associated with clinical trial activities and are expensed as incurred 
costs  including milestones and maintenance fees  to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
reimbursements for shared expenses received from collaborative partners are recorded as reductions of research and development expenses 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to our contract research organizations for trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
stock compensation 
we grant stock options to employees and members of our board of directors for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
through december   we recognized no compensation expense on these stock option grants 
for stock options granted to members of our scientific advisory board  we recognize as expense the estimated fair value of such options as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model  which is re measured during the service period 
fair value is determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the expense is amortized over the vesting period of each option or the recipient s contractual arrangement  if shorter 
changes in the fair value of our common stock during the service period will cause fluctuations in recognized compensation expense for variable options 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  effective january  for the company  requires the expensing of the fair value of stock option grants to employees and directors 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that net deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance will be required on losses reported in future periods 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  stock compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
overview we focus on the development of monoclonal antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer and immunologic diseases 
we currently have three product candidates  sgn  sgn and sgn  in six ongoing clinical trials and three lead preclinical product candidates  sgn  sgn and sgn our pipeline of product candidates is based upon two technologies genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibody drug conjugates adcs 
these technologies enable us to develop monoclonal antibodies that can kill target cells on their own as well as to increase the potency of monoclonal antibodies by linking them to a cell killing payload 
our business strategy is to develop a broad portfolio of product candidates and to license our antibody based technologies to leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to further expand our product opportunities 
we have licensed our adc technology to seven collaborators genentech  ucb celltech  pdl biopharma  curagen  bayer  medimmune and psma development company a joint venture between progenics and cytogen 
we also have internal research and in licensing programs for novel antigens and new monoclonal antibodies 
to date  we have generated revenues principally from our collaboration and license agreements 
these revenues include upfront technology access fees  milestone payments and reimbursement for support and materials supplied to our collaborators 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues increased to million compared to million for the same period in as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and total stockholders equity of million 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
all of our product candidates are in early stages of development and significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to identify  develop and manufacture our product candidates  invest in research  and move towards commercialization of our product candidates 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds and resources 
our operating expenses will likely increase as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  as additional product candidates are selected for clinical development and as some of our earlier stage product candidates move into later stage clinical development 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards commercialization 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on entering into new collaboration and license agreements and achieving development and clinical milestones under existing collaboration and license agreements  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues increased to million in from and increased to million in from  due to higher technology access fees and milestones 
these revenues are further discussed below 
revenues in thousands annual percentage change earned portion of technology access fees and milestones funded research and material supply fees collaborations and license agreements government grants total the earned portion of technology access fees and milestones increased to million in from and increased to million in from these revenues represent earned portions of upfront technology access fees or milestone payments received during the course of our adc collaborations with bayer  curagen  genentech  medimmune  pdl biopharma  psma development company and ucb celltech and our antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy adept collaboration with genencor 
the upfront technology access fees are deferred and recognized ratably over each collaborative research period 
payments for milestones are recognized when the earnings process has been completed 
during  the earned portion of technology access fees and milestone payments increased due to our new adc collaborations with medimmune and psma development company and included milestone payments received from genentech for services we provided to support genentech s process development and manufacturing of adcs using our technology 
in  the earned portion of technology access fees and milestone payments increased due to our new adc collaborations with bayer and curagen 
funded research and material supply fees decreased to million in from and increased to million in from the decrease in in funded research and material supply fees compared to was primarily due to higher material supply fees received in from pdl biopharma 
the growth in this component of revenue in came from increased fees earned as part of the research programs of our new adc collaborations with bayer and curagen and continuation of our existing collaborations 
we expect that our revenues in will increase modestly over levels  driven primarily by recognition of deferred payments previously received under our adc collaborations and to a lesser degree by payments received for materials and support that we provide to our collaborator and milestone and other payments received 
we expect that future revenues will vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year depending on the level of revenues earned and milestone payments received for ongoing adc collaborations and our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements and obtain additional government grants 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses decreased to million in from and increased to million in from our research and development expenses can be divided into research  development and contract manufacturing and clinical expenses 
research and development expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense that was previously reported as a separate line item within operating expenses 
we estimate the costs associated with these activities are as follows research development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical stock compensation expense total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new antigen targets and monoclonal antibodies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  including preclinical translation biology  in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses increased to million in from and increased to million in from primarily due to higher personnel expenses  related general lab supplies  in license fees and depreciation related to new lab equipment purchases 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our drug product candidates 
development and contract manufacturing costs decreased to million in from and increased to million in from in  development and contract manufacturing expenses were approximately million less than in this decrease was caused primarily by the timing of manufacturing campaigns in which resulted in the reduced cost of manufacturing sgn in of approximately million  partially offset by an increase of approximately million related to the manufacturing of sgn offsetting lower contract manufacturing expenses in were increases in staffing costs and quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our drug product candidates 
in  the increase in expenses was primarily caused by increased personnel expenses and related lab supplies associated with higher staffing levels and contract manufacturing costs  principally with abbott laboratories for the manufacturing of our sgn monoclonal antibody product candidate 
this antibody is also used in our sgn adc product candidate 
both research and development and contract manufacturing expenses reflect higher facility costs resulting from our laboratory and office expansion completed during august clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical costs increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  clinical expenses increased due to higher personnel expenses and third party costs associated with sgn  which were partially offset by decreased third party costs due to the discontinuation of our sgn program announced in july in  clinical expenses increased principally due to expanded third party costs for our sgn phase ii trials  new patient enrollments in our sgn phase i trials and costs for our sgn phase ii trials 
clinical expenses also increased in from due to increased personnel expenses associated with higher staffing levels 

table of contents we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple projects  including our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying novel antigen targets  monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs 
many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified project  but instead are directed to overall research efforts 
accordingly  we do not allocate our infrastructure costs and do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we do not report actual total costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
we do  however  separately account for significant third party costs of development programs identified as product candidates for further preclinical and clinical development 
the following table shows total payments that we made or expenses incurred for preclinical study support  clinical supplies and clinical trial services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates and the remaining unallocated costs for such periods product candidates s in thousands annual percentage change years january  to december  sgn sgn sgn sgn sgn sgn and sgn total third party costs unallocated costs and overhead stock compensation expense total research and development our third party costs for sgn in included clinical trial costs and payments made to abbott laboratories to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing to support clinical trials 
we expect the third party costs associated with sgn to increase as we continue to enroll patients and expand our sgn phase i clinical trials  initiate phase ii trials and pursue contract manufacturing for later stage clinical supplies 
sgn third party costs in and are primarily attributable to contract manufacturing and preclinical studies necessary to initiate a planned clinical trial in we expect third party costs for sgn to increase as we initiate clinical trials 
sgn third party costs in are attributable to patient enrollments in our phase ii clinical trials in the united states and europe 
costs attributable to sgn were lower than costs in due to manufacturing activities for sgn that occurred in we expect third party costs for sgn to increase moderately from the amounts incurred in as we continue to enroll patients in our phase ii clinical trials 
costs attributable to sgn in reflect the initiation of a phase i clinical trial and a related milestone payment made to pdl biopharma 
we expect third party costs for sgn to increase from amounts incurred in as clinical activities expand 
we expect that our total research and development expenses in will increase over levels  primarily driven by planned manufacturing activities for sgn and sgn and increased clinical costs for sgn  sgn and sgn and the implementation of sfas r  effective january   which will result in the expensing of stock option grants to employees 
in july  we announced our discontinuance of the development of sgn to focus on advancing our other pipeline programs and second generation adc technology 
although we are not accruing new patients to our sgn phase ii clinical trials  we anticipate some nominal costs during our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward eventual commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that may take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of 
table of contents a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy may include entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our discovery and preclinical activities  as new product candidates enter clinical trials and as we advance our product candidates already in clinical trials to new clinical sites in north america and europe 
these expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate 
general and administrative general administrative in thousands annual percentage change general and administrative stock compensation expense total general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent at approximately million in compared to and increased to million in from general and administrative expenses  excluding stock compensation expense  increased in from and in from in  the increase was primarily attributable to additional administrative personnel and recruiting fees 
in  the increase was primarily attributable to additional administrative personnel and increased professional service fees to facilitate compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of stock compensation expense in and included in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to scheduled amortization of deferred stock compensation in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 

table of contents over the vesting period of stock option grants issued prior to march   as well as accelerated vesting of stock options related to employee severance pay 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in as a result of the implementation of fas r  effective january   which will result in the expensing of stock option grants as well as increased costs related to adding personnel in support of our operations 
investment income  net investment income  net in thousands annual percentage change total investment income increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  the increase was primarily due to increasing average interest yields 
in  the increase was primarily due to additional interest income received from the net proceeds of approximately million from our follow on public offering of  shares of common stock that was completed in february non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend in thousands total non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend was million in and  in in connection with our series a convertible preferred stock financing in july  we recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the preferred stock 
the beneficial conversion feature has been treated as a preferred stock deemed dividend  which resulted in an increase to reported net loss in arriving at net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the non cash accretion of the preferred stock deemed dividend was recorded using the effective interest method through the date of earliest conversion in july and therefore affected only and non cash accretion charges did not have an effect on net loss or cash flows for the applicable reporting periods or have an impact on total stockholders equity as of the applicable reporting dates 
liquidity and capital resources december  liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment securities working capital stockholders equity year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities and funding from our collaboration and license agreements 
during  we received approximately million in cash through fees and milestone payments under our collaboration and license agreements 
to a lesser degree  we have also 
table of contents financed our operations through interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in reflects proceeds of a common stock financing totaling million 
our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we have structured our investment portfolio so that scheduled maturities of investment securities can be used to fund our working capital needs 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and restricted investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  adjustable mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
our stockholders  equity increased in as a result of the common stock financing in february by million and to a lesser degree by the exercise of options to purchase shares of common stock during the periods 
stockholders equity is decreased by our operating losses during the relevant periods 
capital expenditures during were million  which consisted primarily of lab equipment and computers and related information systems in support of our research and development activities and in support of employee growth 
capital expenditures of million in consisted of improvements  lab equipment  furniture and fixtures  primarily in connection with the expansion of our existing headquarters and operations facility for lab and office expansion which was completed during august capital expenditures of  in consisted primarily of lab equipment  computers and related information systems in support of our research and development activities and in support of employee growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will remain at similar levels to in  we expect our revenues to range from million to million and our expenses to range from million to million 
projected increases in expenses reflect expanded clinical trial activities and planned manufacturing campaigns for our sgn and sgn programs 
we also expect that the adoption of sfas r will result in an estimated stock based compensation expense for ranging from approximately to million assuming levels of equity awards similar to in however  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions may be significantly different because of the uncertainty of additional equity awards which may be granted  the unpredictability of the fair value of stock options granted and the estimated expected forfeiture rates 
as a result  stock based compensation charges may differ significantly from the company s current estimates 
further  our expected revenues and expenses are subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties and as a result actual results may differ significantly from our current estimates 
based on our current estimate  we expect to use approximately million to million of our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities to fund our business activities 
at our currently planned spending rate  we believe our remaining financial resources in addition to the expected fees and milestone payments earned under new and existing collaboration and license agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations into however  changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as  increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses preceding commercialization of a product candidate 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  or public or private equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we anticipate that our rate of overall spending will accelerate as a result of the increased costs and expenses associated with adding personnel  clinical trials  regulatory filings  manufacturing  and research and development activities 
however  we may experience fluctuations in incurring these costs from quarter to quarter based on the 
table of contents timing of manufacturing campaigns  accrual of patients to clinical trials and collaborative activities 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending including the cost of filing and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and the progress of our collaborators 
some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the amounts set forth below could be substantially higher if we are required to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties earlier than anticipated 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements total the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements in primarily represent contractual obligations related to manufacturing campaigns to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing for monoclonal antibody and adc products for use in our clinical trials 
as part of the terms of our office and laboratory lease  we have collateralized certain obligations under the lease with approximately  of our investments and the majority of our property and equipment 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party 
commencing in june  we expect that our restricted investments will be reduced to approximately  in the event that we fail to meet specific thresholds of market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investment balances  we are obligated to increase our restricted investment balance to approximately million 
at december   we were in compliance with these thresholds 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in accordance with our policy  we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high quality interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  adjustable mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
such securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise and fall in value if market interest rates change  however  we do not expect any material loss from such interest rate changes
