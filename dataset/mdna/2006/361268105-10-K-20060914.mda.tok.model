item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto which are included herein 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest june the fiscal year ended july  was a week year with the extra week reported in the fourth quarter 
overview g k services  inc  founded in and headquartered in minnetonka  minnesota  is a market leader in providing branded identity apparel and facility services programs that enhance image and safety in the workplace 
we serve a wide variety of north american industrial  service and high technology companies providing them with rented uniforms and facility services products such as floor mats  dust mops  wiping towels  restroom supplies and selected linen items 
we also sell uniforms and other apparel items to customers in our direct sale programs 
the north american rental msa is approximately billion  while the portion of the direct sale market targeted by us is approximately billion in size 
in fiscal  revenue grew to million  up over the prior year as a result of accelerated new account growth  improved customer retention  significantly improved direct sales and acquisitions 
our fiscal net income grew by to million which reflects higher operating income from strong revenue growth  productivity improvements and a lower effective tax rate  partially offset by record energy costs  impact of hurricanes and higher interest expense 
in addition  we continued to accelerate strategic investments in sales  marketing and technology initiatives 
our industry is consolidating from many family owned and small local providers to several large providers 
we are participating in this industry consolidation 
our rental acquisition strategy is focused on acquisitions that expand our geographic presence and or expand our local market share and further leverage our existing plants 
we made a small acquisition during fiscal in october  we acquired certain assets from an organization in ontario  canada  a uniform and textile service company serving customers in sarnia  ontario  detroit  michigan and st 
louis  missouri 
this purchase expands and enhances our uniform and textile rental business in north america 
the pro forma effect of the acquisitions listed above and those made in the last two fiscal years  had they been acquired at the beginning of each fiscal year  were not material  either individually or in the aggregate 
the total purchase consideration  including related acquisition costs of these transactions  was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal purchase consideration includes million of debt issued which was subsequently reduced in fiscal by million 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal critical accounting policies the discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  the most important and pervasive accounting policies used and areas most sensitive to material changes from external factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts our rental operations business is largely based on written service agreements whereby we agree to collect  launder and deliver uniforms and other related products 
the service agreements provide for weekly billing upon completion of the laundering process and delivery to the customer 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
revenue from rental operations also includes billings to customers for lost or abused merchandise 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
estimates are used in determining the collectibility of billed accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances when evaluating the 
table of contents adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates are used in connection with establishing the allowance in any accounting period 
while we have been consistent in applying our judgments and in making our estimates over the past three fiscal years  material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
inventories our inventories consist of new goods and rental merchandise in service 
estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both obsolete and excess inventories 
new goods are stated at lower of cost or market  net of any reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
merchandise placed in service to support rental operations is amortized into cost of rental operations over the estimated useful lives of the underlying inventory items  primarily on a straight line basis  which results in a matching of the cost of the merchandise with the weekly rental revenue generated by merchandise 
estimated lives of rental merchandise in service range from nine months to three years 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets as required under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is separately disclosed from other intangible assets on the balance sheet and no longer amortized 
sfas also requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation follows the two step impairment test prescribed by sfas first we assess whether the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount of the unit including goodwill 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive position  market trends  operating performance  quoted market prices for our equity securities and fair value models and research prepared by independent analysts 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value  we would perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
management completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
there have been no impairments of goodwill in fiscal  or future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangibles associated with acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will add value 
long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there have been no write downs of any long lived assets or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation and auto and general liability programs 
we purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect us from catastrophic losses 
estimates are used in determining the potential liability associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
management estimates consider historical claims experience  escalating medical cost trends  expected timing of claim payments and actuarial analyses provided by third parties 
changes in the cost of medical care  our ability to settle claims and the present value estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
income taxes in the normal course of business  we are subject to audits from federal  state  canadian provincial and other tax authorities regarding various tax liabilities 
these audits may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions  or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amount accrued 
we believe that taxes accrued on our consolidated balance sheets fairly represent the amount of future tax liability due 
we utilize income tax planning to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
we believe that the provision for liabilities resulting from the implementation of income tax planning is appropriate 
to date  we have not experienced an examination by 
table of contents governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that our past provisions for exposures related to income tax planning are not appropriate 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax obligations based upon current facts  circumstances and tax law 
share based payment plans as more fully described below under the restated results of operations  we have adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised share based payment in the first quarter of fiscal under the modified retrospective transition method 
sfas r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that the fair value of all share based transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective transition method  all prior period financial statements were restated to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation option pricing model that incorporates certain assumptions in the following table 
expected volatilities are based on the historic volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the u 
s 
treasury note interest rate in effect at the time of grant 
july  july  july  weighted average volatility expected dividends expected term in years risk free rate

revenues 
total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal rental revenue was up million in fiscal  an increase over fiscal the organic industrial rental growth rate was approximately  an improvement from in fiscal the increase is due to accelerated new account growth and improved customer retention 
the balance of the revenue growth was due to acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
direct sale revenue was million in fiscal  a increase over million in fiscal  largely due to the impact of the lion uniform group 
the organic direct sale growth rate was approximately 
the increase in the organic direct sale growth rate was largely due to garment sales to a major airline and a large telecommunications organization as well as sales to many smaller organizations 
organic growth rates are calculated using industrial rental and direct sale revenue  respectively  adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate differences and revenue from newly acquired business 
we believe that the organic growth rates better reflect the growth of our existing industrial rental and direct sale business and are therefore useful in analyzing our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from rental sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margins resulted from costs associated with new customer growth  higher energy costs  the impact of hurricanes  plant capacity initiatives  offset by margin improvement due to pricing initiatives  higher sales to existing customers and productivity improvements 
cost of direct sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from direct sales increased in fiscal to from in fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved efficiencies from greater sales volume 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement was primarily from leveraging our sales and administrative costs over a larger revenue base offset by continued investment in growth initiatives 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisition of businesses  were million compared to million in fiscal amortization 
amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  amortization expense was in both fiscal and fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal largely due to the resolution of certain statutory tax matters 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal years 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to june as a result  periodically we will have a fiscal year with weeks of results 
fiscal was a week year 
we estimate that the extra week of operation generated incremental earnings of approximately per share in fiscal revenues 
total revenues in fiscal rose to million from million in fiscal excluding the extra week  revenues were up over fiscal rental revenue was up million in fiscal  a increase over fiscal rental revenue increased when excluding the impact of the extra week recorded in fiscal the organic industrial rental growth rate was approximately  an improvement from negative in the same period of fiscal improvements in customer retention and a better pricing environment continues to be negatively impacted by lost uniform wearers due to reduced employment levels within our existing customer base 
direct sale revenue was million in fiscal  a increase over million in fiscal  largely due to the impact of the lion uniform group 
the organic direct sale growth rate was approximately 
the increase in the organic direct sale growth rate was largely due to garment sales through our rental operation including our annual outerwear promotion and large shipments at our direct sale unit to one customer 
cost of rental and direct sale 
cost of rental operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from rental sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margins was due to the positive fixed cost leverage from an extra week of revenue in the prior year  as well as higher energy and acquisition integration costs in the current year 
these were largely offset by the benefit of numerous operational initiatives focused on lower merchandise and production costs 
cost of direct sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin from direct sales increased in fiscal to from in fiscal the increase in gross margin was largely due to improved cost leverage resulting from greater sales volume 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement as a percent of revenue was due to a prior year charge of approximately 
table of contents million for a legal settlement and leverage on incremental revenue growth  partially offset by continued investment in growth initiatives 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding acquisition of businesses  were million compared to million in fiscal amortization 
amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  amortization expense increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower average debt levels associated with strong operating cash flow and slightly lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal largely due to decreases in canadian statutory income tax rates 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition our primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operations and borrowings under our debt arrangements 
primary uses of cash are interest payments on indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal year cash provided by operations was positively impacted by a higher net income  and timing of payments on our accounts payable and accruals which were partially offset by increased expenditures on inventory 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was negatively impacted by the timing of payments of taxes as well as growth in new inventories in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing operation 
these uses of cash were partially offset by continued emphasis to control in service inventory expenditures 
fiscal cash provided by operations was positively impacted by one time improvements related to a focus on timely collection of accounts receivable as well as several initiatives focused on controlling the usage of in service inventory 
working capital at july  was million  a million increase from million at july  this increase was due to increases in accounts receivable and increased inventory levels associated with new business 
investing activities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  and cash was largely used for acquisitions and property  plant and equipment additions 
financing activities 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  provided cash of million in fiscal and used cash of million in fiscal cash used in fiscal was primarily for the repayments of debt 
cash provided in fiscal was from debt proceeds used primarily for acquisitions of businesses 
cash used in fiscal was primarily related to the repayment of long term debt 
we paid dividends of million in each of fiscal  and we anticipate dividends in fiscal year to increase from to per share  which will result in a total dividend of million 
we maintain a million revolving credit facility expiring august  as of july   borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility were million at rates ranging from to 
borrowings under this facility are unsecured 
the unused portion of the revolver may be used for general corporate purposes  acquisitions  working capital needs and to provide up to million in letters of credit 
as of july   letters of credit outstanding against the revolving credit facility were million which primarily relate to our property and casualty insurance programs 
no amounts have been drawn upon these letters of credit 
we have million  unsecured private placement notes with certain institutional investors 
the year notes have a seven year average life with a final maturity on july  beginning on july   and annually thereafter to maturity  we will repay million of the principal amount at par 
as of july   there was million outstanding under the notes 
we maintain a loan agreement expiring on october  under the loan agreement  the lender will make loans to us on a revolving basis up to million 
the facility was amended on june  increasing the facility size from million to million 
we will be required to pay interest on outstanding loan balances at a rate per annum of one month london 
table of contents interbank offered rate libor plus a margin or  if the lender is funding the loan through the issuance of commercial paper to third parties  at a rate per annum equal to a margin plus the average annual interest rate for such commercial paper 
in connection with the loan agreement  we granted a first priority security interest in certain of our us based accounts receivable 
the amount of funds available under the loan agreement will be based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable less various reserve requirements 
at july   there was million outstanding under the agreement at a current rate of 
we have million of variable rate unsecured private placement notes 
the notes bear interest at over libor 
the million variable rate notes are scheduled to mature on june  the notes do not require principal payments until maturity 
interest payments are reset and paid on a quarterly basis 
as of july   the outstanding balance of the notes was million at a current rate of 
the credit facilities  loan agreements  fixed rate notes and variable rate notes contain various restrictive covenants that among other matters require us to maintain a minimum stockholders equity and a maximum leverage ratio  all as defined 
these debt arrangements also contain customary representations  warranties  covenants and indemnifications 
at july   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and only a material adverse change in our financial performance and condition could result in a potential event of default 
in the unlikely event that an event of default would be imminent  management believes that we would be able to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers  however  certain financial concessions might be required 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if amended covenants or waivers in acceptable terms could not be successfully negotiated 
cash obligations 
under various agreements  we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts 
these include payments under the variable rate term loan and revolving credit facility  the fixed rate term loan  capital lease obligations and rent payments required under non cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year 
the following table summarizes our fixed cash obligations as of july  for the next five fiscal years and thereafter in thousands one year two to four to after five or less three years five years years total variable rate revolving credit facility variable rate notes variable rate loan fixed rate notes other debt arrangements  including capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations at july   we had available cash on hand of million and approximately million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our cash commitments and capital requirements for fiscal and to reduce the amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  however  we may utilize borrowings under the revolving credit facility to supplement our cash requirements from time to time 
we estimate that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million to million 
the amount of cash flow generated from operations could be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties 
in fiscal  we may actively seek and consider acquisitions of business assets 
the consummation of any acquisition could affect our liquidity profile and level of outstanding debt 
we believe that our earnings and cash flow from operations  existing credit facilities and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital  if necessary  will be adequate to finance acquisition opportunities 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at july   we had stand by letters of credit totaling million issued and outstanding  primarily in connection with our property and casualty insurance programs 
no amounts have been drawn upon these letters of credit 
pension obligations we account for our defined benefit pension plan using sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions sfas 
under sfas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our defined benefit pension plan of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
at july   the fair value of our pension plan assets totaled million 
we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately million in fiscal we have frozen our defined benefit pension plan and related supplemental executive retirement plan effective january  and have incurred million in costs associated with this action 
all benefits earned by defined benefit plan participants through the end of calendar year will be available upon retirement under plan provisions 
future growth in benefits will no longer occur beyond december  the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
at july   we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is consistent with the assumed rate used at both july  and july  and was developed by evaluating input from our outside actuary as well as long term inflation assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at july  is based on an allocation of us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of at july   at july  and at july  our outside actuary determines the discount rate by creating a yield curve based on high quality bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at july  by approximately million and increase the estimated fiscal pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
impact of inflation in general  we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation or  whichever is greater  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
significant increases in energy costs  specifically natural gas and gasoline  can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
currently  energy costs represent approximately of our total revenue 
litigation we are involved in a variety of legal actions relating to personal injury  employment  environmental and other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
these legal actions include lawsuits that challenge the practice of charging for certain environmental services on invoices 
none of these legal actions are expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on march   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
the proposed standard would require us to recognize in our statement of financial position the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period but pursuant to fas and are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost 
recognize as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings  net of tax  any transition asset or transition obligation remaining from the initial application of fas or measure defined benefit plan assets and defined benefit plan obligations as of the date of our statement of financial position 
disclose additional information in the notes to financial statements about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost in the upcoming fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits 
on july   the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  which fundamentally changes the way that we will be required to treat our uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes 
fin prescribes rules regarding how we should recognize  measure and disclose in our financial statements tax positions that we have taken or will take in our tax return that are reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable  or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability 
we are currently evaluating the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial statements 
share based payment plans we maintain stock option and compensation plans the employee plans to grant certain stock awards  including stock options at fair market value and non vested restricted shares  to our key employees 
exercise periods for stock options are limited to a maximum of years and a minimum of one year and generally vest over three years while restricted stock grants generally vests over five years 
a maximum of  stock awards can be granted under our employee plan and  awards were available for grant as of july  we also maintain the director stock option plan the directors plan 
the directors plan provides for an automatic grant of  nonqualified stock options initial grants to non employee directors as of the later of august or the date such individuals became directors and  nonqualified stock options on each subsequent annual shareholder meeting date and stock grants on the first business day of each calendar year that each nonemployee director is serving 
we have reserved  shares of class a common stock for issuance under the directors plan 
these options expire within years of grant and are exercisable one year from the date of grant  except for the initial grants  of which  one third of the total options are exercisable each year beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant 
the option price will be the average market price of the class a common stock during the business days preceding the date of grant 
we have adopted the provisions of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal under the modified retrospective transition method 
sfas r eliminates accounting for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires instead that the fair value of all share based transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement 
under the modified retrospective transition method  all prior period financial statements were restated to recognize compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of adopting sfas r on july   income before income taxes and net income have been decreased and restated by million and million  respectively  for fiscal year and income before income taxes and net income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates  energy prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
we use financial instruments  including fixed and variable rate debt  as well as interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a one percentage point increase in interest rates under these borrowings would have increased our interest expense for fiscal by approximately million 
this estimated exposure considers the mitigating effects of interest rate swap agreements outstanding at july  on the change in the cost of variable rate debt 
the following tables provide information about our fixed and variable rate debt and our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flow and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates by fiscal year 
the rates include credit spreads and were determined using the forward interest curve as of july  capital leases  operating leases and other debt are not included in the table 
dollars in thousands fixed rate variable rate maturity date amount rate amount rate thereafter total fair value 
table of contents for interest rate swaps  the following table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates by fiscal year 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
at july   we had interest rate swap contracts to pay fixed rates of interest average rate of and receive variable rates of interest based on three month libor on  notional amount of indebtedness 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at july  was  dollars in thousands notional principal average interest average interest maturity date amount pay rate receive rate total energy cost risk we use derivative financial instruments to manage the risk that changes in gasoline cost will have on the future financial results of the company 
we purchase heating oil futures contracts to effectively hedge a portion of anticipated actual gasoline purchases 
the futures contracts are reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income for contracts that cash flow hedge accounting is achieved or in the statements of operations depending on the effectiveness of the hedge 
upon settlement of each contract  the actual gain or loss is reflected in gasoline expense 
the current fair market value of all outstanding contracts at july  is a negative million 
we also utilize natural gas supply contracts to manage the risk associated with natural gas costs 
foreign currency exchange risk we have material foreign subsidiaries located in canada 
the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the canadian dollar and as such are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations 
we may periodically hedge firm commitments with our foreign subsidiary  generally with foreign currency contracts 
these agreements are recorded at current market values and the gains and losses are included in earnings 
there were no outstanding foreign currency contracts at july  notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at july  were million  all of which matured during fiscal notional amounts outstanding under foreign currency contracts at july  were million  all of which matured during fiscal
