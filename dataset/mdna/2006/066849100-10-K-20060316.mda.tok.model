the purpose of this discussion is to highlight significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the past three years  and provide supplemental information and analysis 
certain amounts in the and prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in unless otherwise noted  all dollars are expressed in thousands except per share data 
use of non gaap financial measures certain information discussed below is presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis

an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from this tax exempt income has been added back to the interest income and net interest income totals discussed in this management s discussion and analysis  resulting in tax equivalent adjustments of  and in  and  respectively 
the analysis of net interest income tables included in this annual report on form k provide a reconciliation of tax equivalent financial information to the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
management believes the disclosure of tax equivalent net interest income information improves the clarity of financial analysis  and is particularly useful to investors in understanding and evaluating the changes and trends in the company s results of operations 
other financial institutions commonly present net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
this adjustment is considered helpful in the comparison of one financial institution s net interest income to that of another institution  as each will have a different proportion of tax exempt interest from their earning asset portfolios 
moreover  net interest income is a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions  net interest margin  which is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
for purposes of this measure as well  other financial institutions generally use tax equivalent net interest income to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution

in addition to these challenges  the company must grow revenues and control expenses while managing a heavy regulatory burden 
these are challenges the company has met for many years while serving the citizens and businesses in the markets it serves  and the company anticipates similar results over the next twelve months 
the banking world was subject to much volatility and uncertainty in short term interest rates increased during with the fed tightening eight times or basis points  following five increases or basis points during however  the year us treasury increased only basis points during and has declined basis points since the fed began increasing short term interest rates in june  causing a dramatic basis point flattening of the us treasury yield curve at the end of heading into  growth in net interest income will depend on many factors including how quickly  and by how much  the federal reserve will continue to increase short term interest rates and the effect on the rest of the yield curve  whether the economy will continue on the road to recovery and at what pace  and the impact of an inverted yield curve on the company s net interest margin 
the current and projected shape of the yield curve will be key factors driving the company s net interest income in  and continued earning asset growth will likely be necessary in generating meaningful increases 
though these developments have not had a materially adverse effect on the company to date  the company continues to monitor them closely and believes it is adequately positioned for a variety of future interest rate scenarios 
reflecting trends in the national and regional economies  the company s market area generally witnessed mild economic growth during heading into  the economies and real estate markets in the company s primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the company s assets in future periods and  thus  its results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition 
the company believes future economic activity will in part depend on stronger employment  consumer confidence  personal consumption expenditures  business expenditures for new capital equipment  and a variety of geo political considerations 
other factors  which could affect the company s financial performance and that of its common stock  are more fully enumerated in the forward looking statements discussion at the beginning of this annual report on form k and the company s discussion of certain risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this report 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully enumerated in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the reader of the financial statements should review these policies to gain a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
management believes the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements allowance for loan losses management believes the allowance for loan losses allowance is a significant accounting estimate used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance  which is established through a provision for loan loss expense  is based on management s evaluation of the level of allowance required in relation to the estimated inherent risk of loss in the loan portfolio 
management regularly evaluates the allowance for loan losses for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions and the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of collateral 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
a smaller provision for loan losses results in higher net income  and when a greater amount of provision for loan losses is necessary  the result is lower net income 
refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses and provision  in this annual report on form k  for further discussion and analysis concerning the allowance 
income taxes the company estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of income is presented 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from historical taxes paid and future taxable income and  to the extent that the recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december  and  there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  which are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets the valuation technique used by the company to determine the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets acquired in acquisitions and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based upon changes in economic conditions and other factors 
any changes in the estimates used by the company to determine the carrying value of its goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  or which otherwise adversely affect their value or estimated lives  would adversely affect the company s results of operations 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further details of the company s accounting policies and estimates covering goodwill and other intangible assets

average earning assets represented and of total average assets during and  respectively 
the company  through its management of liabilities  attempts to provide stable and flexible sources of funding within established liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines 
this is accomplished through core deposit products offered within the markets served  as well as through the prudent use of borrowed and brokered funds 
the company s objectives in managing its balance sheet are to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates  and to enhance profitability through strategies that promise sufficient reward for understood and controlled risk 
the company is deliberate in its efforts to maintain adequate liquidity  under prevailing and forecasted economic conditions  and to maintain an efficient and appropriate mix of core deposits  brokered deposits  and borrowed funds

the increase in average earning assets was attributed to average loan growth of  or  offset in part by a decline in average investment securities amounting to  or 
the tax equivalent yield on total average earning assets amounted to in compared with in  representing an increase of basis points 
the increase in earning asset yields was principally attributed to increases in short term interest rates during the year  which favorably impacted the yields on the bank s large floating rate loan base 
in addition  cash flows from the securities and loan portfolios were generally re invested into higher yielding earning assets throughout total tax equivalent interest and dividend income during amounted to  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in interest and dividend income was principally attributed to earning asset growth  combined with higher earning asset yields 
total assets the company s assets principally consist of loans and investment securities  which at december  represented and of total assets  respectively 
at december  the company s total assets stood at  representing an increase of  or  compared with december  the increase in total assets was principally attributed to loan growth of  or  followed by an increase in investment securities amounting to  or 
investment securities the investment securities portfolio represented of the company s average earning assets during and generated of total tax equivalent interest and dividend income  compared with and in  respectively 
the investment securities portfolio is primarily comprised of mortgage backed securities issued by us government agencies  us government sponsored enterprises  and other corporate issuers 
the portfolio also includes tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions  and obligations of other us government sponsored enterprises 
the overall objectives of the bank s strategy for the investment securities portfolio include maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity  diversifying earning assets  managing interest rate risk  leveraging the bank s strong capital position  and generating acceptable levels of net interest income 
the investment securities portfolio is managed under the policy guidelines established by the bank s board of directors 
total investment securities at december   total investment securities stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or the average investment securities balance amounted to  compared with  in  representing a decline of  or 
as noted above  on a year over year basis average investment securities declined while period end balances increased 
during the first nine months of  management chose not to reinvest a portion of the cash flows from the securities portfolio 
these actions were taken in light of strong loan growth  a flattening us treasury yield curve  still historically low market yields  and management s anticipation of higher yields in the near future 
in the fourth quarter of  as market yields climbed towards highs  the bank added  in securities to the balance sheet 
this action was taken as market yields climbed towards highs  presenting opportunities for the bank to increase its earning assets and leverage its strong capital position 
in the fourth quarter of the yield on the year us treasury note peaked at a three year high  while the year us treasury note peaked at a fifteen month high 
in light of the historically low interest rate environment over the past few years and the relatively high degree of interest rate volatility  the bank s investment strategy has been principally focused on maintaining the majority of the securities portfolio with a relatively short average duration  thereby limiting some of the exposures associated with sustained increases in interest rates 
this was accomplished through investments in securities with predictable cash flows and relatively short average maturities 
the bank s strategy has been to position the majority of the securities portfolio defensively with a steady stream of future cash flows 
while this strategy sacrifices some yield in the near term  the bank s objectives were to maintain a reasonable level of net interest income  manage longer term interest rate and market risks  provide ongoing sources of liquidity  and position the portfolio for a variety of future interest rate scenarios 
trading securities trading securities are securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in price 
as of december  and  the bank did not own any trading securities 
securities held to maturity securities held to maturity are debt securities for which the bank has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity 
held to maturity investments are reported at their aggregate cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
during the years ended december  and  the bank did not own any securities held to maturity 
as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  during the bank transferred into the available for sale securities portfolio all of its held to maturity investment securities 
securities transferred consisted of longer term  tax exempt securities representing obligations of state and political subdivisions 
the held to maturity securities were transferred to available for sale at their fair value of  with an unrealized gain on these securities  net of taxes  amounting to  recorded in other comprehensive income 
management does not intend to utilize the held to maturity classification in the foreseeable future 
securities available for sale securities available for sale represented of total investment securities at december  and the designation of securities available for sale is made at the time of purchase  based upon management s intent to hold the securities for an indefinite time  however  these securities would be available for sale in response to changes in market interest rates  related changes in the securities prepayment risk  needs for liquidity  or changes in the availability of and yield on alternative investments 
the securities available for sale portfolio is managed on a total return basis with the objective of exceeding the return that would be experienced if investing solely in us treasury instruments 
the securities available for sale portfolio is used for liquidity purposes while simultaneously producing earnings 
investment securities classified as available for sale are reported at their fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  excluded from earnings but shown separately as a component of shareholders equity 
gains and losses on the sale of securities available for sale are determined using the specific identification method and are shown separately in the statement of income 
the balances of securities available for sale are stated on the consolidated balance sheet net of fair value adjustments  reflecting net unrealized losses of  at december  and net unrealized gains of  at december  the change in net unrealized gains and losses was principally attributed to higher prevailing market yields at december  compared with the same date in for example  the yields on  and year us treasury notes were   and basis points higher  respectively  at december  compared with the same date in the unrealized loss position at december  also reflects the fact that a portion of the securities were purchased during periods of historically low interest rates and market yields  but does not give consideration to matched funding sources eg  borrowings acquired during those same periods of historically low interest rates which are not adjusted to current market value 
the following table summarizes the securities available for sale portfolio as of december  and december  available for sale amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses estimated fair value obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities obligations of u

the company recognizes the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts in interest income using the interest method over the estimated life of the security 
purchase premiums are amortized to the earliest call date  while purchase discounts are accreted to maturity 
premiums paid on mortgage backed securities are amortized proportionate to the three month trailing average constant payment rate cpr of each securitized pool of mortgages 
securities credit risk the bank evaluates and monitors the credit risk of its investment securities utilizing a variety of resources including external credit rating agencies  predominantly moody s and standard and poor s

the bank held no investment securities having a credit rating below a as of december  securities interest income the total aggregate tax equivalent yield on the securities portfolio amounted to in  compared with in  representing an increase of basis points 
the increase was principally attributed to the availability of higher market yields in compared with prior years 
securities incrementally added to the securities portfolio during generally carried higher yields and moderately longer durations 
in addition cash flows from the securities portfolio were generally reinvested into securities with higher market yields 
total tax equivalent interest income from the securities amounted to  in  compared with  in  representing a decline of or 
the decline in interest income from securities was attributed to the  or decline in average securities during compared with securities maturity distribution the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of the amortized cost of the bank s investment securities and weighted average yields of such securities on a fully tax equivalent basis as of december   based upon the final maturity date of the securities 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or pre pay certain securities 
in the case of mortgage backed securities  actual maturities may also differ from expected maturities due to the amortizing nature of the underlying mortgage collateral  and the fact that borrowers in most cases have the right to prepay 
maturity schedule for investment securities december  at fair value one year or less greater than one year to five years greater than five years to ten years greater than ten years obligations of us government sponsored enterprises weighted average yield mortgage backed securities obligations of us government agencies weighted average yield obligations of government sponsored enterprises weighted average yield other mortgage backed securities weighted average yield obligations of state and political subdivisions weighted average yield total maturity schedule for investment securities december  at fair value one year or less greater than one year to five years greater than five years to ten years greater than ten years obligations of us government sponsored enterprises weighted average yield mortgage backed securities us government agencies and sponsored enterprises weighted average yield other mortgage backed securities weighted average yield obligations of state and political subdivisions weighted average yield other debt securities weighted average yield total securities concentrations at december  and  the bank did not hold any securities for a single issuer  other than u 
s 
government agencies and sponsored enterprises  where the aggregate book value of the securities exceed of the company s shareholders equity 
management believes us government sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk  as they play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
at december  and  all securities issued by government agencies and sponsored enterprises were credit rated aaa by mood s and standard and poor s 
impaired securities the securities portfolio contains certain investments where amortized cost exceeds fair market value  which at december  amounted to  compared with at december  unrealized losses that are considered other than temporary are recorded as a loss on the company s consolidated statement of income 
in evaluating whether impairment is other than temporary  management considers a variety of factors including the nature of the investment security  the cause of the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  and the bank s ability and intent to hold the security to maturity 
other data considered by management includes  for example  sector credit ratings  volatility of the security s market price  and any other information considered relevant in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred 
at december  and  management determined there were no unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio that were other than temporary 
the following table summarizes temporarily impaired investment securities and their approximate fair values at december  all securities referenced are debt securities 
at december   the bank did not hold any common stock or equity securities in its investment securities portfolio 
temporarily impaired investment securities december  less than months months or longer total fair value number of investments unrealized losses fair value number of investments unrealized losses fair value number of investments unrealized losses description of securities obligations of us government sponsored enterprises mortgage backed securities obligations of us government agencies obligations of government sponsored enterprises other obligations of state and political subdivisions total temporarily impaired securities at december   the total unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities amounted to  representing of their amortized 
at december   no individual security had an unrealized loss greater than of its amortized cost 
as of december   unrealized losses on securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position more than twelve months amounted to  or of their amortized cost at december  at december   there were a total of investment securities in an unrealized loss position more than twelve months 
for securities with unrealized losses  the following information was considered in determining that the impairments are not other than temporary 
us government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and therefore bear no credit risk 
us government sponsored enterprises have minimal credit risk  as they play a vital role in the nation s financial markets 
other bonds and notes are generally comprised of corporate mortgage backed securities and all investments maintain a credit rating of at least a by one of the nationally recognized rating agencies 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are either issued by federal government agencies and sponsored enterprises  or by private issuers  all with security ratings of aaa 
management believes the unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio at december  were attributed to interest rate increases  and reflected the volatile movements in the us treasury curve over the past few years 
specifically  certain debt securities were purchased in an interest rate environment lower than where the us treasury yield curve stood on december  because the decline in market value was attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because the bank has the ability and intent to hold these investment securities until a recovery of their amortized cost  which may be at maturity  the company does not consider these investment securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  management believes the extent of unrealized losses on mortgage backed securities will diminish over time as principal payments and pre payments are received and durations continue to shorten 
in the case of debt securities  management believes unrealized losses will diminish over time as maturity dates continue to shorten 
management also believes that any declines in the us treasury yield curve will further diminish the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio  as market values typically increase in a declining interest rate environment 
conversely  management believes that upward movements in the us treasury yield curve will increase the extent of unrealized losses in the securities portfolio over the near term

this category of loans principally includes loans to government municipalities and  to a lesser extent  not for profit organizations 
government municipality loans typically have short maturities and low interest rate risk characteristics 
government municipality loans are typically originated through a bid process among local financial institutions and are aggressively priced  thus generating narrow net interest income margins

management follows a policy of continually identifying  analyzing and grading credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing independent review  subsequent to management s review  of individual credits is performed by an independent loan review function  which reports to the audit committee of the board of directors 
management recognizes that early and accurate recognition of risk is the best means to reduce credit losses and maximize earnings 
the bank employs a comprehensive risk management structure to identify and manage the risk of loss 
for consumer loans  the bank identifies loan delinquency beginning at day delinquency and provides appropriate follow up by written correspondence or personal contact 
non residential mortgage consumer losses are recognized no later than the point at which a loan is days past due 
residential mortgage losses are recognized during the foreclosure process  or sooner  when that loss is quantifiable and reasonably assured 
for commercial loans the bank applies a risk grading system  which stratifies the portfolio and allows management to focus appropriate efforts on the highest risk components of the portfolio 
the risk grades include ratings that correlate with regulatory definitions of pass  other assets especially mentioned  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are placed on non accrual status  either due to the delinquent status of principal and or interest  or a judgment by management that  although payments of principal and or interest are current  such action is prudent because collection in full of all outstanding principal and interest is in doubt 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when principal and or interest is days overdue  or sooner if judged appropriate by management 
consumer loans are generally charged off when principal and or interest payments are days overdue  or sooner if judged appropriate by management 
non performing loans non performing loans include loans on non accrual status  loans that have been treated as troubled debt restructurings  and loans past due days or more and still accruing interest 
there were no troubled debt restructurings in the loan portfolio during and this continued to be the case during the following table sets forth the details of non performing loans over the last five years 
total non performing loans at december loans accounted for on a non accrual basis real estate loans construction and development mortgage loans to finance agricultural production and other loans to farmers commercial and industrial loans loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures total non accrual loans accruing loans contractually past due days or more total non performing loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans non performing loans to total loans during the year ended december   non performing loans remained at relatively low levels 
the bank attributes this  in part  to mature credit administration processes and underwriting standards  aided by a relatively stable local economy 
the bank maintains a centralized loan collection and managed asset department  providing timely and effective collection efforts for problem loans 
at december   total non performing loans amounted to compared with as of december   representing an increase of at december   non performing loans represented of total loans compared with at december  while the non performing loan ratios continued to reflect the favorable quality of the loan portfolio at december   bank management is cognizant of relatively soft economic conditions overall  and believes it is managing credit risk accordingly 
future levels of non performing loans may be influenced by economic conditions  including the impact of those conditions on the bank s customers  including higher interest rates and debt service levels  oil and gas prices  and other factors existing at the time 
management believes the economic activity and conditions in the local real estate markets will continue to be significant determinants of the quality of the loan portfolio in future periods and  thus  the company s results of operations and financial condition 
potential problem loans in addition to the non performing loans discussed above  the bank also has loans that are to days delinquent 
these loans amounted to  and  at december  and  or and of total loans  respectively 
these loans and delinquency trends are considered in the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses and the related determination of the provision for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses allowance stood at  compared with  at december   representing a decline of  or 
the allowance is available to absorb losses on loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance and provisioning for estimated losses is evaluated quarterly based on review of loans  with particular emphasis on non performing and other loans that management believes warrant special consideration 
the bank s board of directors reviews the evaluation of the allowance to ensure its adequacy 
the allowance is maintained at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of risk inherent in the current loan portfolio  and adequate to provide for estimated losses 
reserves are established for specific loans including impaired loans  a pool of reserves based on historical charge offs by loan types  and supplemental reserves that adjust historical loss experience to reflect current economic conditions  industry specific risks  and other observable data 
loan loss provisions are recorded based upon overall aggregate data  and the allowance is increased when  on an aggregate basis  additional estimated losses are identified and deemed likely 
no portion of the allowance is restricted to any loan or group of loans  and the entire allowance is available to absorb realized losses 
the amount and timing of realized losses and future allowance allocations could vary from current estimates 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changing economic conditions and the economic prospects of the borrowers may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance  which also may necessitate future additions or reductions to the allowance  based on information available to them at the time of their examination

the bank had no troubled debt restructurings at december  and  and all of its impaired loans were considered collateral dependent and were adequately reserved 
management reviews impaired loans to ensure such loans are transferred to interest non accrual status  and written down when necessary 
the amount of interest income not recorded on impaired loans amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general reserves account for the risk and estimated loss inherent in certain pools of industry and geographic loan concentrations within the loan portfolio 
there was no major change in loan concentrations during the december  allowance calculation incorporated loss estimates relating to loans to borrowers involved in the maine wild blueberry processing industry  principally centered in washington county  maine 
during the fourth quarter of  certain legal proceedings developed between borrowers engaged in the maine wild blueberry processing industry and their growers  the uncertainties of which bank management believed warranted recognition of certain increases in credit risk 
during the first quarter of  these matters were  in the opinion of management  satisfactorily resolved 
at december   the adequacy analysis of the allowance incorporated a revised estimate of inherent risk of loss with respect to this industry segment  compared with december  based upon the process employed and giving recognition to all attendant factors associated with the loan portfolio  the company considers the allowance for loan losses at december  to be appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  and resident in the local and national economy as of that date 
funding sources the bank utilizes various traditional sources of funding to support its earning asset portfolios 
funding sources principally consist of retail deposits and  to a lesser extent  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb of which it is a member  and certificates of deposit obtained from the national market 
historically  the banking business in the bank s market area has been seasonal  with lower deposits in the winter and spring and higher deposits in the summer and fall 
these seasonal swings have been fairly predictable and have not had a materially adverse impact on the bank 
seasonal swings in deposits have been typically absorbed by the bank s strong liquidity position  including borrowing lines from the fhlb and cash flows from the investment securities portfolio 
according to a january report prepared by the maine bureau of financial institutions  in through june  maine banks continued to book loans faster than core deposits  necessitating increased reliance on non core funding 
as a consequence  among maine banks  the loan to core deposit ratio rose to a record high of  well above the national average of and up from one year earlier 
during  the bank s average loan to core deposit ratio amounted to  compared with in according to the maine bureau of financial institutions  because core deposit growth has not kept pace with earning asset growth  maine banks have had to rely increasingly on borrowings and other types of non core funding  which supported of maine bank assets as of june   compared with the national average of 
during the bank s non core funding averaged of total average assets  compared with in management believes that the bank s future success in growing core funding will be a determinant factor in its ability to grow earning assets and leverage its strong capital position 
deposits during  the most significant source of funding for the bank s earning assets continued to be retail deposits  gathered throughout its network of eleven banking offices throughout downeast and midcoast maine 
total average retail deposits accounted for of the funding required in supporting the bank s earning asset portfolios during  compared with in total deposits at december  total deposits amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or the increase in total deposits was principally attributed to certificates of deposit obtained from the national market brokered deposits  which accounted for  or of total deposit growth 
retail deposit growth amounted to  in  or 
the rate of retail deposit growth lagged historical norms during management believes that competition from banks and non banks intensified  as savers and investors sought higher returns in an atmosphere of rising short term interest rates  and that financial institutions in particular have been aggressive in pricing their deposits in order to fund earning asset growth 
since short term rates began rising in june  management has exercised restraint with respect to overly aggressive deposit pricing strategies  and has sought to achieve an appropriate balance between retail deposit growth and wholesale funding levels  while protecting the bank s net interest margin and liquidity position

demand deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in the rate of demand deposit growth lagged historical norms during management attributes this  in part  to a lower level of seasonal deposits compared with historical norms  and believes this was consistent with a reportedly slow tourist season in the market areas served by the bank 
management also believes that competition for demand deposit intensified during  with more financial institutions offering no fee checking accounts 
during the second and third quarters of  the bank launched a variety of new business and personal demand deposit products  including free checking products  which it believes are highly competitive and designed to satisfy the changing expectations of both individual and business customers 
management believes these products will help increase demand deposits in the foreseeable future 
the bank strives to attract demand deposits in connection with its commercial lending activities  on a total relationship basis 
the bank s business checking account offerings include small businessplus  businessplus  and free small business  each designed to help business owners manage the varying financial aspects of their business 
the bank also offers its business customers a variety of cash management products including a cash management sweep account 
customers are able to automatically transfer their excess demand deposit balances  over certain thresholds established with an earnings credit rate  to interest bearing  overnight securities repurchase agreements 
business demand deposits are also generated by way of the bank s merchant credit card processing program

during the bank also offered a tiered rate  money market account  investors choice  providing businesses and individuals with short term investment alternatives 
bank management attributes the sluggish growth in average savings and money market accounts to aggressive pricing competition from banks and non banks  as savers shopped for higher returns in an atmosphere of well publicized  rising short term interest rates 
in response to competitive pricing pressures and continuing market demand  in the first quarter of the bank introduced its new prime based horizon money market account  which it believes is highly competitive and designed to satisfy the needs of both small and large investors alike 
time deposits at december   total time deposits stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
total average time deposits amounted to  during compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
time deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in in pricing time deposits  particularly non relationship time deposits  the bank will consider other sources of funding which may be offered at more attractive terms and prices  including borrowed funds and time deposits available in the national market 
bank management attributes the growth in time deposits to its competitive pricing strategies and customer retention programs 
additionally  given the increase in short term interest rates and the flattening us treasury curve  investors and savers appeared attracted to higher yielding certificates of deposit with relatively short term maturities 
time deposits in denominations of or greater totaled  at december   compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of or greater maturity schedule time deposits thousand or greater december  maturity three months or less over three months to six months over six to twelve months over twelve months brokered time deposits at december   total brokered time deposits stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
total average brokered time deposits amounted to  during compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
brokered time deposits represented of total average deposits during  compared with in the increase in brokered time deposits was primarily attributed to the funding needs associated with the bank s strong earning asset growth  principally loans  which outpaced retail deposit growth during in addition  during the bank modified its funding and liquidity strategies  providing more balance between brokered and borrowed funds  which during posted an average balance increase of only compared with the rates of interest paid on brokered time deposits were generally more favorable than collateralized advances from the federal home loan bank  the primary source of wholesale funding used by the bank 
borrowed funds borrowed funds principally consist of advances from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlb and  to a lesser extent  securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
advances from the fhlb are secured by stock in the fhlb  investment securities  and blanket liens on qualifying mortgage loans and home equity loans 
the bank utilizes borrowed funds in leveraging its strong capital position and supporting its earning asset portfolios 
borrowed funds are principally utilized to support the bank s investment securities portfolio and  to a lesser extent  fund loan growth 
borrowed funds also provide a means to help manage balance sheet interest rate risk  given the bank s ability to select desired amounts  terms and maturities on a daily basis 
borrowings from the federal home loan bank at december   borrowings from the fhlb totaled  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
during  borrowings from the fhlb averaged  compared with  in  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in borrowings from the fhlb was utilized to fund earning asset growth  which outpaced the growth in retail deposits 
during  the bank re balanced a portion of its wholesale funding base by utilizing a greater proportion of brokered certificates of deposit obtained in the national market to support earning asset growth 
this action was taken to strengthen the bank s strategic liquidity reserves  providing a higher level of just in time funding afforded by readily available advances from the fhlb 
total average borrowings from the fhlb expressed as a percentage of total average assets amounted to during  compared with in securities sold under agreements to repurchase at december   securities sold under repurchase agreements amounted to  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
securities sold under repurchase agreements were collateralized by us government sponsored agency obligations 
borrowing maturities borrowing maturities are managed in concert with the bank s asset and liability management strategy  and are closely aligned with the ongoing management of balance sheet interest rate risk 
as of december   total short term borrowings  including securities sold under repurchase agreements  amounted to  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
conversely  long term borrowings at december  totaled  compared with  at december   or and of total borrowings  respectively 
the bank has utilized higher cost  longer term borrowings to manage the interest rate risk associated with the growth in longer term  fixed rate  earning assets generated during periods of historically low interest rates 
while this strategy has pressured net interest income in the near term  management believes it lessens the degree of interest rate risk and better positions the bank for rising interest rates and an improving economy 
capital resources consistent with its long term goal of operating a sound and profitable organization  the company continues to be a well capitalized bank holding company according to applicable regulatory standards 
management believes this to be vital in promoting depositor and investor confidence and providing a solid foundation for future growth 
historically  most of the company s capital requirements have been provided through retained earnings and this continued to be the case during the year ended december  stock repurchase plans in november  the company announced a stock repurchase plan 
the board of directors of the company at that time authorized open market and privately negotiated purchases of up to of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  or  shares 
as of the date of termination of this plan on december   the company had repurchased  shares of stock under the plan  at a total cost of  and an average price of per share 
the company recorded the repurchased shares as treasury stock 
in march  the company announced a second stock repurchase plan 
the board of directors of the company authorized open market and privately negotiated purchases of up to of the company s outstanding shares of common stock  or  shares 
purchases began on march  and were to continue through december  the company s board of directors subsequently authorized the continuance of this program through december  depending on market conditions and other factors  these purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares of stock under this plan  at a total cost of  and an average price of per share 
the company believes that a stock repurchase plan is a prudent use of its capital at this time 
management anticipates the stock repurchase plan will be accretive to the return on average shareholders equity and earnings per share 
management also believes that the stock repurchase plan helps facilitate an orderly market for the disposition of large blocks of stock  and lessens the price volatility associated with the company s thinly traded stock 
cash dividends the company has historically paid regular quarterly cash dividends on its common stock 
each quarter the board of directors declares the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends  subject to adjustment from time to time  based on the company s earnings outlook  the strength of the balance sheet and other relevant factors 
the company s principal source of funds to pay cash dividends and support its commitments is derived from bank operations 
during  the company paid declared cash dividends in the aggregate amount of  the company s earnings payout ratio amounted to  compared with in in the first quarter of  the company increased its quarterly dividend by to per common share 
the dividend was paid march  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  quarterly dividends continued at this rate through in the first quarter of  the company increased its quarterly cash dividend by to per common share 
the dividend is payable to all shareholders of record as of february   with a payment date of march capital ratios the company and the bank are subject to the risk based capital guidelines administered by the company s and the bank s principal regulators 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under these guidelines  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of  including a minimum ratio of tier i capital to total risk weighted assets of and a tier i capital to average assets of leverage ratio 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory  and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
as of december   the company and the bank were considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
under the capital adequacy guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a minimum total risk based capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  a minimum tier i capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of at least  and a minimum tier i leverage ratio of at least at december   the company s total risk based capital was  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  at december   the company s tier i capital totaled  or of risk weighted assets  compared with  or of total risk weighted assets at december  the ratio of tier i capital to average assets  or leverage ratio  at december  was  compared with at december  the following table sets forth the company s regulatory capital at december  and december   under the rules applicable at that date

there are no known trends  events or uncertainties  nor any recommendations by any regulatory authority  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s capital resources  liquidity  or financial condition 
contractual obligations the company is a party to certain contractual obligations under which it is obligated to make future payments 
these principally include borrowings from the fhlb  consisting of short and long term fixed rate borrowings  and collateralized by all stock in the fhlb  a blanket lien on qualified collateral consisting primarily of loans with first and second mortgages secured by one to four family properties  and certain pledged investment securities 
the company has an obligation to repay all borrowings from the fhlb 
the company is also obligated to make payments on operating leases for its offices in somesville and bangor  maine 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  borrowings are stated at their contractual maturity due dates and do not reflect call features  or principal amortization features  on certain borrowings 
contractual obligations payments due by period description total amount of obligations year years years years operating leases borrowings from the federal home loan bank securities sold under agreements to repurchase total in the normal course of its banking and financial services business  and in connection with providing products and services to its customers  the company has entered into a variety of traditional third party contracts for support services 
examples of such contractual agreements would include services providing atm  visa debit and credit card processing  trust services accounting support  student loan servicing  check printing  and the leasing of t telecommunication lines supporting the company s wide area technology network 
the majority of the company s core operating systems and software applications are maintained in house with traditional third party maintenance agreements of one year or less 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is  from time to time  a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  that may be material to investors 
at december  and  the company s off balance sheet arrangements were limited to standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit the bank guarantees the obligations or performance of certain customers by issuing standby letters of credit to third parties 
these letters of credit are sometimes issued in support of third party debt 
the risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to customers  and they are subject to the same origination  portfolio maintenance and management procedures in effect to monitor other credit products 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon issuance of a standby letter of credit  is based upon management s credit evaluation of the customer 
at december   commitments under existing standby letters of credit totaled  compared with  at december  the fair value of the standby letters of credit was not significant as of the foregoing dates 
off balance sheet risk the bank is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and certain financial derivative instruments  namely  interest rate swap agreements and interest rate floor agreements 
commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit represent agreements by the bank to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination provisions and may require payment of a fee 
since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis using the same credit policies as it does for its balance sheet instruments  such as loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon the issuance of commitment  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
the following table summarizes the bank s commitments to extend credit as of december commitments to extend credit commitments to originate loans unused lines of credit un advanced portions of construction loans total financial derivative instruments as part of its overall asset and liability management strategy  the bank periodically uses derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on net interest income 
derivative instruments that management periodically uses as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swap agreements and interest rate floor agreements 
a policy statement  approved by the board of directors of the bank  governs use of derivative instruments 
the notional amounts of the financial derivative instruments do not represent exposure to credit loss 
the bank is exposed to credit loss only to the extent the counter party defaults in its responsibility to pay interest under the terms of the agreements 
management does not anticipate non performance by the counter party to the agreements  and regularly reviews the credit quality of the counter party from which the instruments have been purchased 
the details of the bank s financial derivative instruments as of december  are summarized as follows 
interest rate swap agreements description maturity notional amount in thousands fixed interest rate variable interest rate receive fixed rate  pay variable rate prime receive fixed rate  pay variable rate prime the bank is required to pay a counter party monthly variable rate payments indexed to prime  while receiving fixed rate payments based upon interest rates of and  respectively  over the term of each respective agreement

the declines in net cash flows received from counter parties were attributed to increases in the prime interest rate during and interest rate floor agreements notional amount termination date prime strike rate premium paid during the third and fourth quarters of  interest rate floor agreements were purchased by the bank to limit its exposure to falling interest rates on a pool of loans indexed to the prime interest rate 
under the terms of the agreements the bank paid up front premiums for the right to receive cash flow payments if the prime rate falls below the predetermined floor rates  thus effectively ensuring interest income on a pool of prime based loans at a minimum of and on the  and  notional amounts for the duration of the agreements  respectively 
the interest rate floor agreements were designated as a cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas liquidity liquidity is measured by the company s ability to meet short term cash needs at a reasonable cost or minimal loss 
the company seeks to obtain favorable sources of liabilities and to maintain prudent levels of liquid assets in order to satisfy varied liquidity demands 
besides serving as a funding source for maturing obligations  liquidity provides flexibility in responding to customer initiated needs 
many factors affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served by its network of offices  its mix of assets and liabilities  reputation and credit standing in the marketplace  and general economic conditions 
the bank actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios established under its asset liability management policy approved by the bank s board of directors 
continual monitoring of these ratios  both historical and through forecasts under multiple rate scenarios  allows the bank to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
the bank uses a basic surplus model to measure its liquidity over and day time horizons 
the relationship between liquid assets and short term liabilities that are vulnerable to non replacement are routinely monitored 
the bank s policy is to maintain its liquidity position at approximately of total assets 
at december   liquidity  as measured by the basic surplus model  was over the day horizon and over the day horizon 
a portion of the bank s deposit base has been historically seasonal in nature  with balances typically declining in the winter months through late spring  during which period the bank s liquidity position tightens 
at december   the bank had unused lines of credit and net unencumbered qualifying collateral availability to support its credit line with the fhlb approximating million 
the bank also had capacity to borrow funds on a secured basis utilizing certain un pledged securities in its investment securities portfolio 
the bank s loan portfolio and investment portfolio provide a source of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through sales 
the bank also has access to the national brokered deposit market  and has been using this funding source to bolster its liquidity position 
changes in economic conditions  including consumer savings habits and availability or access to the brokered deposit market could potentially have a significant impact on the company s liquidity position 
the bank maintains a liquidity contingency plan approved by the bank s board of directors 
this plan addresses the steps that would be taken in the event of a liquidity crisis  and identifies other sources of liquidity available to the company 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and virtually all of the liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates and the us treasury yield curve may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
while the financial nature of the company s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  inflation does affect the company because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total company assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on the company s financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is the principal component of the company s income stream and represents the difference or spread between interest generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is entirely generated by the bank 
fluctuations in market interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income

net interest margin the net interest margin  expressed on a tax equivalent basis  represents the difference between interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and interest paid to depositors and other creditors  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
the net interest margin is determined by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average interest earning assets 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the average tax equivalent yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is generally higher than the interest rate spread due to the additional income earned on those assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  primarily demand deposits and shareholders equity 
the company s net interest margin amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing declines of and basis points  respectively

in june of  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve began increasing short term interest rates 
through december   the fed funds targeted rate had been increased thirteen times  ending at 
however  during this same period of time  the benchmark year us treasury note declined basis points  causing a dramatic basis point flattening of the us treasury yield curve 
preceding the start of the federal reserve s interest rate tightening cycle in june  the company s net interest margin had been posting steady declines  as the historically low interest rate environment caused sharp yield declines on the bank s variable rate earning assets and accelerated prepayment speeds on fixed rate earning assets driven by loan refinancing activity and accelerated cash flows from the securities portfolio 
this environment caused considerable margin erosion  as the decline in yields on earning assets occurred at a faster pace than the decline in the cost of interest bearing funds 
as short term interest rates continued to increase during the second half of  the net interest margin began to strengthen  as the bank s earning asset base was re pricing faster than the increases in its funding costs  due in part to a large floating rate loan base  the bank s asset sensitive balance sheet  and a variety of pricing strategies implemented by bank management 
in the second quarter of the net interest margin began to decline and this decline continued to accelerate through the end of the year 
the declining net interest margin during was principally attributed to the increases in the bank s cost of funds outpacing the increases in yields on its earning assets  reflecting the re pricing of a large portion of the bank s funding base during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  combined with highly competitive pricing pressures with respect to loans and deposits  a higher utilization of wholesale funding  and the inherent net interest margin challenges widely associated with a flat us treasury yield curve 
the yield on average earning assets amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing an increase of basis points and a decline of basis points  respectively 
similarly  the cost of interest bearing liabilities amounted to in  compared with and in and  representing an increase of basis points and a decline of basis points  respectively 
during  the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities exceeded the increase in yields on earning assets by basis points  whereas in the decline in yields on earning assets exceeded the decline in the cost of interest bearing funds by basis points 
bank management anticipates continued pressure on the net interest margin during  and believes that continued balance sheet growth will be needed to meaningfully increase the bank s level of net interest income in  should interest rates remain at current levels  or the u 
s treasury yield curve become inverted 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity position is more fully described in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
interest income for the year ended december   total interest income  on a fully tax equivalent basis  amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing increases of  and  or and  respectively 
the increase in interest income was attributed to average earning asset growth of  or  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average earning asset yield 
the increase in interest income compared with was principally attributed to earning asset growth of  or  offset in part by a basis point decline in the weighted average earning asset yield 
as depicted on the rate volume analysis tables below  the increased volume of average earning assets on the balance sheet during contributed  to the increase in interest income compared with  while the increase attributed to the impact of a higher weighted average earning asset yield amounted to  in  the increased volume of average earning assets on the balance sheet contributed  to the increase in interest income compared with  offset in part by a decline of  attributed to the impact of a lower weighted average earning asset yield 
interest expense for the year ended december   total interest expense amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing increases of  and  or and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was principally attributed to a  or increase in average interest bearing liabilities  combined with a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest expense compared with was principally attributed to an  increase in average interest bearing liabilities  offset in part by a basis point decline in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
as depicted on the rate volume analysis tables below  the increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet during contributed to the increase in interest expense compared with  while the increase attributed to the impact of a higher weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities contributed  in  the increased volume of average interest bearing liabilities on the balance sheet contributed  to the increase in interest expense compared with  but was substantially offset by a decline of  attributed to the impact of a lower weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
rate volume analysis the following tables set forth a summary analysis of the relative impact on net interest income of changes in the average volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in average rates on such assets and liabilities 
the income from tax exempt assets has been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis  thereby allowing uniform comparisons to be made 
because of the numerous simultaneous volume and rate changes during the periods analyzed  it is not possible to precisely allocate changes to volume or rate 
for presentation purposes  changes which are not solely due to volume changes or rate changes have been allocated to these categories in proportion to the relationships of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

provision for loan losses for the year ended december   the bank did not record a provision for loan losses  compared with and in and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses allowance at a level that  in management s judgment  is appropriate for the amount of inherent risk of loss in the bank s current loan portfolio 
in prior reporting periods the allowance incorporated loss estimates relating to certain borrowers in the maine wild blueberry processing industry that were involved in legal proceedings with certain blueberry growers  which management believed warranted recognition of increased credit risk 
during the first quarter of  these legal matters were  in the opinion of management  satisfactorily resolved  thus improving the overall credit risk profile of the bank s loan portfolio 
the bank s non performing loans remained at low levels during at december   total non performing loans amounted to  or of total loans  compared with or at december  the allowance expressed as a percentage of non performing loans amounted to at december   compared with at december  the bank s loan loss experience showed an improvement during  with net charge offs amounting to  or net charge offs to average loans outstanding of  compared with  or net charge offs to average loans outstanding of during based upon the continued improvement in the performance of the loan portfolio  combined with certain improvements with respect to specific credit relationships including borrowers engaged in the maine wild blueberry processing industry  as noted above the bank did not record a provision for loan losses in refer to part ii  item  allowance for loan losses  in this annual report on form k for further discussion and analysis regarding the provision for loan losses 
non interest income in addition to net interest income  non interest income is a significant source of revenue for the company and an important factor in its results of operations 
for the year ended december   total non interest income amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing declines of and or and  respectively 
factors contributing to the changes in non interest income are enumerated in the following discussion and analysis trust and financial services income income from trust and financial services represented of the company s total non interest income in  compared with and in and  respectively 
income from trust and financial services is principally derived from fee income based on a percentage of the market value of client assets under management and held in custody and  to a lesser extent  revenue from brokerage services conducted through bar harbor financial services  an independent third party broker 
for the year ended december   income generated from trust and financial services amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing an increase of or and a decline of or  respectively 
the increase in fee income compared with was driven by trust and investment services  as revenue generated from third party brokerage activities at bar harbor financial services posted a moderate decline  reflecting lower trading volumes  including sales of mutual funds and annuity products 
the decline in fee income compared with was attributed to declines in revenue generated from third party brokerage services and  to a lesser extent  fee income from trust and investment services  reflecting declines in average assets under management and the implementation of pricing strategies designed to remain competitive while attracting new business 
at december   total managed assets at bar harbor trust services stood at  compared with  at december   representing an increase of  or 
in light of the growth in the managed assets portfolio  management believes the portfolio is positioned to generate higher levels of fee income in service charges on deposit accounts this income is principally derived from monthly deposit account maintenance and activity fees  overdraft fees  and a variety of other deposit account related fees 
income from service charges on deposit accounts represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income generated from service charges on deposit accounts amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing declines of and  or and  respectively 
as was the case during  income generated from service charges on deposit accounts remained under pressure during bank management attributes the declines  in part  to aggressive competitive pricing in the markets served by the bank  and believes this will continue in the future as financial institutions compete for deposit market share and continue to offer a variety of no fee products 
management also believes that over the past couple of years customers have been closing or consolidating small balance accounts  migrating to relationship products that have lower fees  and reducing their volume of account overdraft activity 
during  the bank launched a new overdraft honor service which it believes will help increase non interest income generated from deposit account service charges 
credit card service charges and fees this income is principally derived from the bank s merchant credit card transaction processing services and  to a lesser extent  fees associated with its visa credit card product 
income from credit card service charges and fees represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income generated from credit card service charges and fees amounted to  compared with  and  in and  representing increases of and  or and  respectively 
while merchant credit card processing profit margins have generally tightened over the past few years  with competition from large regional processors intensifying  the bank has been able to grow revenue through new business  increased volumes of transactions  competitive pricing strategies  and the local support offered by a community bank 
net securities gains this source of non interest income is derived from net gains on the sale of investment securities 
net gains on the sale of investment securities represented of total non interest income  compared with and in and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net gains on the sale of investment securities amounted to  compared with and  in and  representing an increase of or  and a decrease of or  respectively 
the sale of securities during was driven by a combination of strong loan growth  the timing and extent of seasonal deposit flows  the bank s liquidity needs  and responses to significant changes in market yields 
there is no assurance that the recording of securities gains will continue in future reporting periods at  and levels 
it is important to note  however  that the available for sale securities portfolio is managed on a total return basis  in concert with well structured asset liability management policies 
bank management will continue to respond to changes in market interest rates  changes in securities pre payment or extension risk  changes in the availability of and yields on alternative investments  and the bank s need for adequate liquidity 
net income on interest rate swap agreements as part of its overall asset liability management strategy  the bank periodically uses interest rate swap agreements to minimize significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
at december   the bank had two outstanding interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts totaling  as more fully enumerated in part ii
