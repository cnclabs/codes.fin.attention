table of contents risk management the corporation s risk management committee committee meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and an independent director 
the objective of the committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the corporation and its affiliates 
the committee s risk review is broad in scope and includes the following risks credit  interest rate  liquidity  price  transaction  compliance  strategic and reputation 
a primary responsibility of the committee is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes six basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed preestablished dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation directly lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern maryland 
although this may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers minimizes this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
and sixth  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein 
in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
in addition to internal controls  loan portfolios are reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 
one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
at year end  the corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio  real estate construction and land development was percent  and commercial real estate leasing was percent 
commercial leasing pertains to borrowers who lease real estate for business purposes 
comparatively  at year end  real estate construction and land development was percent  and commercial real estate leasing was percent 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate 
nonperforming assets table nonperforming assets  presents asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss 
management generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  are contractually past due  but well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the final category  foreclosed real estate is real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to peoplesbank 
table also provides a summary of nonperforming assets and related ratios 
the paragraphs below explain the changes within each asset category presented in table for december   compared to december  logo

the corporation recognizes interest income on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans 
on december   the nonaccural loan portfolio was  compared to  on december  the level of nonaccural loans was relatively low for both periods 
on december   nonaccural loans were comprised of fourteen unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  the two largest accounts  totaling  pertain to business loans that in management s judgment are adequately collateralized by real estate assets 
management and the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly 
collection efforts including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts  based on prevailing market conditions  and liquidation of collateral assets are being employed to maximize recovery 
on december   there were no accruing loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest  compared to  on december  generally  loans in the past due category are adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
foreclosed real estate  net of allowance  was  on december   compared to  on december  the decrease was attributable to the sale  in february  of real estate from one account that had a carrying value of approximately  sale proceeds exceeded the carrying value of the real estate by  resulting in a gain on the sale 
the provision expense for foreclosed real estate  due to declines in the fair value of individual assets  was  for  compared to  for and  for on december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which were not disclosed in table a loss allowance is established for those potential problem loans that in management s judgment were inadequately collateralized 
comparatively  management was monitoring approximately million in potential problem loans on december  logo 
table of contents allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio at december  the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 
in analyzing the adequacy of the allowance  management considers the results of internal and external credit reviews  past loss experience  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adequacy of collateral  general economic conditions and the local business outlook 
all of these factors are susceptible to significant change 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which are often subjective and fluid 
table presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses represents probable losses inherent in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated allowance analyses  such as industry concentrations  imprecision in the loan risk evaluation process and current economic factors 
the allowance was  or 
percent of total loans on december   compared to  and 
percent  respectively  on december  the increase in the allowance was primarily the result of a  or percent increase in the loan loss provision 
the increase in the provision was based in part on the significant increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans  which are inherently more risky than other types of loans 
other factors that influenced the increase in the provision were the local employment outlook two major employers were acquired  and concern over the broader economy  particularly rising energy costs and market interest rates  which may portend debt service problems for some of our borrowers 
these other factors contributed to an increase in the unallocated component in as noted in table based on a recent evaluation of probable loan losses in the current portfolio  management believes that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the loan portfolio on december  logo

table of contents liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
retained earnings from profitable operations are another source of liquidity 
the consolidated statements of cash flows present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
for  management believes that liquidity was adequate based on its availability from many sources  including the potential liquidation of a million portfolio of available for sale securities valued at december   and unused credit with the fhlbp of approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was percent for year end  compared to percent for year end management believes that the addition of two financial centers in march of will provide liquidity in the form of new deposits 
off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist mainly of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit of this report and totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 
accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
as discussed below in the market risk management section  management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management in the normal course of conducting business  the corporation is exposed to market risk  principally interest rate risk  through the operations of its banking subsidiary  peoplesbank 
interest rate risk arises from market driven fluctuations in interest rates that may affect cash flows  income  expense and the values of financial instruments 
peoplesbank is particularly vulnerable to changes in short term interest rates such as the prime rate and libor 
an asset liability committee committee comprised of members of senior management manages interest rate risk 
the committee s objective is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk and within capital adequacy constraints 
peoplesbank is not subject to foreign currency or commodity price risk and it does not own any trading assets 
the committee manages interest rate risk primarily through sensitivity analysis 
asset liability management simulation software alm model is used to model and measure the potential loss in future net income based on hypothetical changes in interest rates 
interest rate forecasts are supplied by a national forecasting service and integrated with the alm model 
the corporation s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net income is percent over a twelve month period 
this policy limit is tested on a quarterly basis by measuring the change in net income from a baseline scenario where interest rates are held constant  to a high rate scenario gradual basis point increase in prime and fed funds rates  a low rate scenario gradual basis point decrease in prime and fed funds rates and a most likely scenario defined by a forecasting service over the future twelve month period 
important alm modeling assumptions include the use of a static balance sheet and contractual cash flows  varying levels of prepayments for loans and mortgage backed securities  stability of noninterest income and expense  reinvestment of repriceable cash flows in the same type of asset or liability  and constant product rate spreads  determined at the balance sheet date  over the twelve month measurement period 
the alm model also includes significant balance sheet characteristics such as rate caps and floors 
the corporation performed a financial simulation on the balance sheet for december  and the results of these point in time analyses are shown in table for year end  the alm model portrayed a balance sheet that was interest rate risk neutral  which suggests that future earnings  principally the net interest income component  would be stable under the hypothetical changes in market interest rates modeled 
comparatively  the alm model portrayed an asset sensitive balance sheet at year end  which suggested that earnings would increase if market interest rates increase  or conversely  decrease if market rates decrease 
asset sensitivity means that loan and investment assets will reprice to a greater and faster degree than the deposits and debt that fund them 
throughout  short term interest rates increased basis points in response to economic tightening by the federal reserve  while long term interest rates remained relatively stable  or in some cases declined slightly 
logo 
table of contents many loan clients showed a preference for fixed rate instruments to lock in rates  while deposit clients preferred variable or floating rate instruments with short maturities 
the result was a gradual shift year over year in the balance sheet from an asset sensitive position to a more neutral position 
table interest rate sensitivity forecasted change in interest rates change in interest rate ramped over months net income scenario basis points s at december  most likely high flat baseline low at december  most likely high flat baseline low measurement of interest rate risk requires many assumptions 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower rates on net income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors including timing of cash flows  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  customer behavior  changes in market conditions  and management strategies
