the complaint alleges that certain actions by the plan and the committee violated the employee retirement income security act of  as amended  erisa as a result of amendments made to the plan that allegedly were either improper and or ineffective and as a result of certain payments made to certain beneficiaries of the plan that allegedly were improperly calculated and or discriminatory on account of age

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results will differ from these under different assumptions or conditions 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
approximately of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the retail last in  first out lifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
the remaining of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the specific identified cost method 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise to its customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
we recorded an allowance for sales returns of million  million and million for the years ended january   january  and january  adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision has been insignificant for the years ended january  and january  
table of contents merchandise vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from its merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and markdown reimbursement programs 
co operative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the period in which the reimbursement occurred 
all other merchandise vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchases when received 
accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor concessions has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or selling and administrative expenses 
the amounts recognized as a reduction in cost of sales have not varied significantly over the past three fiscal years 
insurance accruals 
the company s consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to self insured workers compensation and general liability claims 
the company estimates the required liability of such claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends have been insignificant for the years ended january  and january  further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
a change in our self insurance reserve would have affected net earnings by million for the fiscal year ended january  finite lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or store closings 
the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
the company currently has stores that based on current cash flow projections are not impaired but do have recovery periods that extend a number of years 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill annually and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using projected discounted cash flows and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  the company s effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 

table of contents the company s income tax returns are periodically audited by various state and local jurisdictions 
additionally  the internal revenue service audits the company s federal income tax return annually 
the company reserves for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the contingent amount is reasonably estimable 
these reserves are based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions as well as various tax filing positions 
due to the complexity of these examination issues  for which reserves have been recorded  it may be several years before the final resolution is achieved 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the citigroup high grade corporate yield curve on its annual measurement date and is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the discount rate had increased to as of january  from as of january  a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately million
