item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of our operations 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report 
certain statements made in our discussion may be forward looking 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from our expectations 
see cautionary statements at the beginning of this report on form k for additional discussion of some of these risks and uncertainties 
unless the context requires otherwise  when we refer to we  us and our  we are describing harken energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
business overview during  our results of operations reflect increased consolidated oil and gas revenues through the benefit of increased oil and gas prices and significant gains from sales of certain of our holdings of common shares of global energy development plc global 
these sales of shares  along with the exercise of global stock options and warrants  decreased our direct equity interest in global from approximately at december  to approximately at december  see capital structure changes in our ownership of global shares below for detail of the changes in our ownership in global during the year 
also in  we simplified our capital structure by redeeming a significant portion of our outstanding preferred stock including the series g preferred  series j preferred  series l preferred and the majority of our series g and series g preferred 
we extinguished approximately million principal amount in outstanding debt during in addition  through the sale of certain of our shares in global in the market to a variety of purchasers throughout the year  on a consolidated basis  we held approximately million in cash and short term investments at december  during  we are focused on pursuing additional energy based growth opportunities as well as continuing the development of our oil  gas and coalbed methane assets and investments 
our domestic operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  gulf energy management company gem 
gem s operations consist of exploration  exploitation  development  production and acquisition efforts in the united states  principally in the onshore and offshore gulf coast regions of south texas and louisiana  as well as coal bed methane exploration and development activities in indiana and ohio 
during  gem s operations were adversely affected by an unusually active hurricane season in the gulf coast region 
both hurricane katrina and hurricane rita resulted in the shut in of production and helped contribute to the decrease in gem s oil and gas production by approximately during as compared to the efforts associated with evaluating and repairing damage and restoring oil and gas production took a significant amount of time and focus for gem during in connection with our operated properties  we have scheduled property damage insurance  but not business interruption coverage 
on our non operated louisiana properties  our property damage insurance coverage is provided through the respective property s operator 
see gem s operations effect of recent hurricanes in the gulf of mexico below for additional information 
gem s drilling program for was reduced as compared to its budgeted program due to the hurricanes and the reduced level of accessibility of equipment and services in the gulf coast region during the third and fourth quarters of gem has budgeted approximately million for its capital expenditure program which is expected to be funded through available cash on hand and generated future cash flows from operations 
as of february   gem has restored its oil and gas production to approximately of its pre hurricane production rate 
even with the reduced level of production associated with the gulf coast hurricanes in  higher than average commodity prices  as compared to the past three years  offset the decreased production for gem as compared to 
table of contents during  gem was successful in diversifying its operations by entering into two significant coalbed methane exploration and development agreements in indiana and ohio 
each prospect provides for an area of mutual interest of approximately  acres 
the agreements provide for a phased delineation  pilot and development program  with corresponding staged expenditures 
contracted third parties with a long track record of successful coalbed methane development provide expert advice the technical consultant for these projects 
see gem s operations coalbed methane prospects indiana and ohio below and note mergers  acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
gem is actively evaluating other strategic coalbed methane opportunities in pursuit of long lived reserve prospects to compliment our current oil and gas portfolio 
our international crude oil exploration and production operations are conducted through our as of december  ownership interest in global 
global has exploration and production activities in colombia and exploration activities in panama and peru 
revenues from global are derived solely from its colombian oil production 
during the year ended december   global increased their sales compared to the prior year period by selling approximately  net barrels of oil after royalties and the cajaro working interest allocation in colombia 
these sales generated oil revenues of approximately million and represented approximately of our consolidated revenues for such period 
global s activities in panama and peru  thus far  have been limited to technical evaluations of potential exploration areas 
global acquired several new contracts and related acreage in colombia and peru during see global s operations below for more detail regarding these new contracts 
during  we were also engaged in minimal energy trading through our investment in international business associates iba  which focused primarily on trading energy futures or other energy based contracts  principally in the united states 
during  we invested million in iba in exchange for  convertible preferred shares of iba representing a beneficial ownership interest in that entity 
during  iba had a low volume of trading activities and was unsuccessful in obtaining trading contracts overseas 
as of december   iba is no longer trading domestic contracts and is focusing on pursuing natural gas futures contracts overseas 
in february  iba redeemed  shares of our iba convertible preferred shares along with our shares of iba common stock in exchange of cash consideration of million 
we are currently evaluating strategic alternatives regarding our remaining investment in iba 
industry outlook the oil and gas industry experienced increasing commodity prices throughout supply and geopolitical uncertainties  combined with strong demand  resulted in historically high prices for the industry 
new york mercantile exchange nymex futures price for west texas intermediate wti crude oil averaged per barrel for the year  with a low price of about per barrel occurring in the first quarter of and a high price point in excess of per barrel in the third quarter of crude oil prices were driven largely by weather  geopolitical instabilities in various producing regions  including the middle east  nigeria and venezuela  as well as concerns that world oil production may be challenged to meet overall market demand 
these concerns  coupled with rapidly growing demand  particularly in asian markets  contributed to strong pricing and market volatility 
the year ended with wti crude oil prices at about per barrel 
us natural gas pricing was also strong throughout the year  with nymex henry hub futures prices never falling below per million british thermal units mmbtu 
the gas market continues to be driven by fundamental uncertainties regarding the industry s ability to maintain supply in line with increasing demand 
in spite of high gas storage inventories  pricing peaked during the fourth quarter of at around per mmbtu 
late in the fourth quarter  prices moderated in response to continued high inventory levels and mild winter conditions for much of the country 
for the year  nymex natural gas prices averaged about per mmbtu and ended the year at about per mmbtu 
the outlook for the commodity markets in calls for continued volatility 
many experts see prices for both oil and gas moderating  but remaining above historical levels 

table of contents gem s operations effect of recent hurricanes in the gulf of mexico gem s louisiana operations in were affected by one tropical storm and two hurricanes that interrupted both production and certain drilling operations 
as much as of gem s domestic production was shut in during september and approximately of its pre storm production level remains curtailed as of february  partial production was restored at backridge in november and at main pass in december gem continues to inspect and repair damage to its eastern gulf operations that remain shut in which include  point a la hache and non operated properties at branville bay and port arthur 
restoration of remaining curtailed production is also dependent on resumption of downstream infrastructure and the availability of service and equipment contractors necessary for over water transportation and repairs 
net income for gem during reflects both slightly decreased revenue  due to the interruption of production  and the direct costs principally shut in operating expenses and estimated repair cost related to the hurricanes 
we expect gem operating results to reflect the restoration costs and the continuing effect of shut in production from the hurricanes 
in connection with our operated properties  we have scheduled property damage insurance  but not business interruption coverage 
in  gem recognized net expenses  after insurance recoveries  in connection with repairs associated with the storms in the amount of  related to its operated property interests and approximately  in connection with its non operated interests affected by the hurricanes 
insurance deductibles associated with two storms and property losses not covered by insurance comprised the recorded losses 
on our non operated louisiana properties  our property damage insurance coverage is provided through the operator of each property 
prior to hurricanes katrina and rita and including new production initiated in  gem had increased its net domestic production rate to approximately million cubic feet equivalent of natural gas per day compared to the rate averaged for the second quarter of million cubic feet equivalent of natural gas per day 
as of december   gem properties were producing at approximately million cubic feet equivalent per day 
we do not anticipate returning to previous production levels prior to april the following field data updates the status of gem s domestic operations through december  lapeyrouse field  terrebonne parish louisiana hurricane impact 
damage to property interests operated and non operated was minimal and production was fully restored in september field activity 
gem holds an average non operated working interest of in eight wells in this field  including one additional well for that commenced production in may following two workovers and one well deepening in the field completed in the fourth quarter  gross field production has increased from million cubic feet equivalent per day to approximately million feet equivalent per day 
in june  gem spudded a ninth well which resulted in a gas well completion in december pending pipeline connection that logged multiple pay zones consistent with the productive horizons in the other wells in the field 
the initial production test was million cubic feet equivalent of natural gas per day  with first production from this well expected in april gem holds an approximately operated working interest in this well 

table of contents main pass  plaquemines parish louisiana hurricane impact 
production was shut in for days until mid december due to damages to production facilities and limitations of the down stream transmission infrastructure 
repairs to gem s facilities are ongoing and gross production in the field has returned to approximately of pre katrina levels 
repair work on a second rental compressor damaged by the hurricane is expected to be completed by april gem has a interest in main pass and is the field operator 
gem s eight mile pipeline connecting the facility to the crude oil shore terminal was repaired and successfully tested  eliminating the need to secure alternative sales delivery services for main pass production 
field activity 
during late  gem completed a major overhaul and rebuild of an additional compressor that had been off line for the past four years 
this investment in the unit increased gas lift in the main pass field 
prior to hurricane katrina  production in the field had increased by approximately bopd with an expectation of additional production from additional wells shut in in prior years 
gross production for the field is now approximately bopd and expected to reach approximately bopd after repairs are complete 
gem continues its geological and geophysical study in the area  utilizing the recently acquired license to square miles of d seismic data  covering the area held by production leases 
raymondville field  willacy and kenedy counties texas in  gem participated in an active recompletion campaign in this field with little success 
it is expected that field production has peaked and will continue to decline

lake raccourci field  lafourche parish louisiana hurricane impact 
although both hurricanes katrina and rita required the shut in of production for short periods in august and september  as of december   the field s production had been restored to its pre storm capacity 
also  repairs resulting from the storms were minimal and were completed in october field activity 
gem holds a operated working interest in each of its lake raccourci wells 
gem is presently seeking industry partners to drill a field extension well 
this prospect is a result of continuing interpretation of gem s square mile reprocessed d seismic database 
new d seismic licenses acquired louisiana gem continues to evaluate seismic licenses acquired in covering approximately square miles of d seismic data in three different surveys across south louisiana 
the largest database is in terrebonne parish and includes approximately square miles 
approximately square miles is in cameron parish  and approximately square miles in iberville parish 
a number of leads have developed in this continuing study 
gem is in the process of cataloging and prioritizing the seismic data 
south beach field  chambers county texas gem has a non operated working interest of in this area 
the initial well was drilled to a true vertical depth of  feet and completed in the fourth quarter of gem also participated in a second well drilled during the first quarter of after experiencing long delays to tie in to the transmission pipelines  production on the well commenced in august

damages to this non operated property have been difficult to assess given the difficulty of access to the location 
all wells in this field have been shut in since hurricane katrina 
recently  the operator communicated that the repair of damage to its production facilities is required before this property can return to production 
the operator has estimated its production facility will not be completed until april field activity 
gem has a non operated working interest of in this area 
the initial well was drilled to a total depth of  feet in the well was completed in the two logged productive sands  and production began in february a second well was completed to a total depth of  feet and was connected to the transmission pipeline in the third quarter of point a la hache field  plaquemines parish louisiana hurricane impact 
damages to this field by hurricane katrina are expected to be approximately  before insurance  net to gem s interest 
the damages principally affected a leased production barge facility installed at the location in july repair of the production barge has required its removal to a drydock to complete repairs which are not expected to be completed before april field activity 
the initial well  state lease  was drilled to a true vertical depth of  feet in mid december the well was logged productive  completed and tested in the lower sand of two sands that both logged productive 
the well began producing in july gem maintains a operated working interest in the area 
allen ranch field  colorado county texas gem owns an non operated working interest in the area 
the initial well  the hancock gas unit  was drilled to a measured depth of  feet in late january the well was productive in four sands with first production in april and has been producing approximately  mcf per day 
in september  the well was fracture stimulated resulting in a production increase to  mcf per day 
as a result of the success with the first well  the hancock gas unit was spudded in october as an offset to the first well 
this second well was logged as productive in the same four sands as the initial well and two deeper zones have indications of potentially being productive also 
with production casing set and fracturing operation pending  first production is expected in the first quarter of southeast nada field  colorado county texas gem has a non operated working interest in this area 
the initial well  the popp et al  was drilled to a measured depth of  feet in late march the well was logged productive in two sands and began producing in may coalbed methane prospects indiana and ohio in  gem entered into two significant exploration and development agreements in indiana and ohio 
each prospect provides for an area of mutual interest of approximately  acres 
the agreements provide for a phased delineation  pilot and development program  with corresponding staged expenditures

table of contents on the indiana posey prospect  the coring phase commenced in may with gem s funding of  for core drilling that was completed by the prospect operator in july in september  after the submission of a phase i core evaluation report by the technical consultant  gem elected to proceed and fund pilot well drilling under phase ii of the agreement 
with regard to phase ii  gem made an additional  prospect acquisition payment and will fund a  afe in for the first of two pilot well projects on the indiana prospect 
gem expects the drilling of the pilot wells will commence in the first quarter of  including facilities costs  if necessary  to gather and sell any significant production 
under the agreement  a second pilot well project may be initiated by the funding of a second afe by gem for approximately  following an extended evaluation period of the pilot wells  gem will evaluate a phase iii election and funding of a development well program as contemplated by the agreements 
on the ohio cumberland prospect  the coring phase commenced in may with gem s funding of  for core drilling that was completed by the prospect operator in july currently  the core samples are continuing to be analyzed 
depending on the final evaluation  including the core evaluation report due from the technical consultant and the operator  gem may elect to proceed and fund a phase ii of pilot wells on this prospect 
effective november  gem extended its cbm projects to include an exploration and development coalbed methane project within the triangle prospect area in ohio  consisting of approximately  acres of land with the potential of acquiring additional acreage in subsequent phases of this project 
see note mergers  acquisitions and dispositions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  gem is actively evaluating other strategic coalbed methane opportunities in pursuit of long lived reserve prospects to compliment our current oil and gas portfolio 
global s operations revenues from global are derived solely from its colombian oil production 
during  global increased its sales compared to the corresponding prior year period due to increased crude oil prices as well as increased production 
in april  global entered into a new crude oil sales contract with petrobras colombia limited  a subsidiary of petrobras  the state oil company of brazil  with an effective date of may  the non exclusive contract offers global improved terms through a reduced quality adjustment levy 
quality adjustment levies can fluctuate daily based upon market conditions and slight variances in production blend 
the contract is for an initial one year period with an automatic renewal unless advance notice is received from either party and covers all crude oil production tendered from global s palo blanco  anteojos  rio verde  torcaz and bolivar fields in colombia  net of royalties paid to the colombian government and empresa colombiana de petroleos ecopetrol s portion of production from one well  the cajaro in april  global announced that the new license contract for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in the block area located in the mara on basin of northeastern peru between global and perupetro sa perupetro  the national oil company of peru  the license contract had been fully executed and was effective 
global owns a working interest in the license contract area subject only to an initial royalty 
the size of the ongoing royalty is to be determined by future production levels 
the contract duration is approximately seven years for the initial exploration phases and years for the exploitation phase 
the contract assigns global exclusive exploration and production rights to approximately  acres 
during phase of the contract  the terms require global to complete within months  environmental impact studies and plans for the drilling of a well in the breta a field located in block 
table of contents in may  global commenced work to acquire approximately kilometers of new d seismic data within the area of its rio verde exploration and production contract in colombia 
the seismic data is being acquired around the two producing wells located on the rio verde acreage  the tilodiran and macarenas  in order to evaluate whether to drill additional wells within the contract area 
in addition  a proportion of the seismic data is being acquired elsewhere in the contract area to consider future exploratory wells 
the new seismic data will be processed alongside with the reprocessing of kilometers of existing seismic data as required under the terms of the contract 
in may  global signed a new exclusive technical evaluation agreement tea with the national hydrocarbons agency of the republic of colombia anh for the evaluation of potential hydrocarbon resources in the valle lunar area located in the established llanos basin of eastern colombia 
the total acreage covered by the tea is approximately million acres 
the valle lunar area has been subject to prior exploration activity by an international petroleum company in with two exploration wells reported as productive at that time 
the valle lunar tea targets medium heavy oil deposits and grants global the exclusive option to sign a future exploration and production concession contract  typically years in duration  for acreage within the tea area that global identifies as prospective and suitable for exploratory drilling and production operations 
the tea duration is months 
the tea requires global to complete within months the reprocessing and interpretation of linear kilometers of existing d seismic data and certain other geophysical measurements and analysis  including the acquisition of aeromagnetic data 
in september  global exercised its exclusive option to commence negotiations with anh to convert a portion of the valle lunar tea area into the luna llena exploration and production contract and signed this contract in december in october  global announced positive test results from its first exploratory well on the los hatos exploration and production concession contract area in colombia 
global placed the los hatos well on production in november global now has production from five different contracts in colombia 
in december  global signed a new exclusive exploration and production concession contract for the caracoli area the caracoli contract with the anh 
the caracoli contract covers approximately  acres in the catatumbo basin located in northeastern colombia 
this basin is a sub basin of the prominent maracaibo basin which extends in a southwesterly direction from venezuela into colombia 
the caracoli contract brings the number of contracts global now holds in colombia to seven 
global holds a working interest in the caracoli contract subject only to an initial royalty  with the size of the royalty to be determined by future production levels 
the contract duration is years  divided into an initial year exploration phase and a year exploitation and production phase 
under the terms of the caracoli contract  global must acquire within months  kilometers of d seismic data and reprocess kilometers of existing seismic data 
global can elect  at its option  to proceed to phase  also months  and drill one exploratory well and acquire limited amounts of additional seismic data 
phases to  all optional and months in length  require the drilling of an exploratory well in each phase 
global expects to fund the required work program with cash flow from its five existing productive contracts in colombia 

table of contents capital structure simplification of our capital structure during  we simplified our capital structure while seeking to increase the value of our investments in oil and gas assets 
during the year ended december   we retired outstanding debt of approximately million and preferred stock with a liquidation value of million 
in october  global issued a total of million principal amount of its variable coupon convertible notes global notes  which mature on october   in exchange for million cash 
the global notes are convertible into ordinary shares of global at uk pence per ordinary share to be converted at the agreed upon exchange rate of us dollars per british sterling pound 
future possible conversions of the global notes into shares of global s common stock would dilute our ownership in global 
some of these capital structure changes involved the conversion of certain convertible debt and preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
as a result  our common shares outstanding increased from million shares outstanding at december  to approximately million shares outstanding at december  at december   if our remaining outstanding debt  convertible preferred stock and common stock purchase warrants were exercised and or converted  we would be required to issue the following amounts of our common stock instrument conversion exercise price a shares of common stock issuable at december  series m preferred series g preferred series g preferred series l warrants series m warrants common stock potentially issued upon conversion exercise a certain conversion and exercise prices are subject to adjustment under certain circumstances as of december   on a consolidated basis  we had cash and short term investments of million and working capital of million including million cash held by global 
we had approximately million in shareholders equity at december

lyford warrants to purchase up to  shares of global held by us at a price of uk pence per share 
lyford s representative  alan quasha  became a member of our board of directors and our chairman in march in september  lyford exercised its warrants in exchange for cash proceeds of million  and we recognized a gain on exercise of global warrants of approximately million in the consolidated condensed statement of operations 
this gain represents the difference between our proportionate net book value of our shares in global as of the date of exercise and the cash proceeds received plus the fair value of the lyford warrant liability immediately prior to exercise 
we do not expect to recognize similar gains in the future 
possible deconsolidation of global as of december   lyford owned approximately of the common shares of global as a result of its exercise of its global warrants 
also at december   lyford beneficially owned approximately of the combined voting power of our common stock 
therefore  our direct equity interest of approximately  combined with lyford s equity interest in global  which totals to a combined ownership percentage of  was deemed to provide us with the legal power to control the operating policies and procedures of global 
as a result  we continued to consolidate the operations of global as of december  lyford has informed us that it may liquidate a portion of its equity ownership interest in global through strategic sales under certain conditions 
if lyford reduces its equity ownership interest in global  such that the combined equity interest in global is less than  we may no longer be deemed to hold the legal power to control the operating policies and procedures of global 
as a result  we would no longer report global s operating results in our consolidated financial statements  but we would account for our investment in global on the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in global will be presented on a single line in the consolidated balance sheet 
likewise  our share of global s earnings will be reflected on a single line in the consolidated statement of operations

lyford is in a position to exercise significant influence over the election of our board of directors and other matters 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap which requires us to use estimates and make assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  industry conditions and various other factors which we believe are appropriate 
actual results could vary significantly from our estimates and assumptions as additional information becomes known 
see note summary of significant accounting policies contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further discussion of our critical accounting policies 
the more significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions are described below 
proved reserves our estimates of proved reserves are based on quantities of oil and gas reserves which current engineering data indicates are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves are key elements in determining our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and our full cost ceiling limitation 
estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise because of uncertainties in projecting rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures  interpretations of geological  geophysical  engineering and production data and the quality and quantity of available data 
changing economic conditions also may affect our estimates of proved reserves due to changes in developmental costs and changes in commodity prices that may impact reservoir economics 
we utilize independent reserve engineers to estimate our proved reserves annually 
see note oil and gas disclosures in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations represent our best estimate of the fair value of our future abandonment costs associated with our oil and gas properties  including the costs of removal and disposition of tangible equipment  site and environmental restoration 
we estimate the fair value of our retirement costs in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
the determination of the fair value of an asset retirement obligation generally involves estimating the fair value of the obligation at the end of the property s useful life and then discounting it to present value using our credit adjusted  risk free rate of return 
estimating future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding the expected removal and site restoration costs  timing and present value discount rates 
changes in the estimated useful life and the fair value of the asset retirement obligation are imprecise since the removal activities will generally occur several years in the future and asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental and safety considerations that may ultimately impact the amount of the obligations 
derivative instruments we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
to reduce the impact of this risk in earnings and to increase the predictability of our cash flow  from time to time we enter into certain derivative contracts primarily option floors for a portion of our north american oil and gas production 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  we are required to record all derivative contracts at fair value in our balance sheet 
changes in fair value are required to be recorded in income or other comprehensive income  depending on the hedging designation and the hedge effectiveness 
our estimates of fair value are based on market quotes from third parties 
while the fair values of our derivatives have fluctuated significantly  our estimates of fair value have historically been consistent with the settlement amounts 

table of contents fair value of our debt and equity transactions many of our various debt and equity transactions require us to determine the fair value of a debt or equity instrument in order to properly record the transaction in our financial statements 
we utilized independent third parties to assist us in determining the fair value of many of our transactions 
fair value is generally determined by applying widely acceptable valuation models  eg  the black scholes valuation model using the trading price of the underlying instrument or by comparison to instruments with comparable maturities and terms

iba s operating profit reflects net trading losses 
iba s net trading losses for and are included in interest and other income 
table of contents gem operating profit and global operating profit during and our operating profits were dramatically affected by rising commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil 
our average realized natural gas price per million cubic feet mcf increased from in to in and to in  an increase of in and in crude oil prices experienced similar increases

table of contents were substantially reduced due to the severe storms 
oil and gas production volumes in decreased bcf equivalent bcfe  or approximately compared to prior year approximately bcfe of the decrease was attributable to the december sale of the panhandle properties 
the reduction in gas revenue was partially mitigated by new production from wells drilled during and the increase in natural gas prices during our average realized natural gas price increased in approximately to per mcf

gem uses oil and gas derivative financial instruments  primarily floors with maturities of months or less  to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas commodity prices on future crude oil and natural gas production 
we have evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in commodity prices would have had on the fair value of its commodity price risk sensitive financial instruments at december  in september  gem purchased a crude oil floor contract with a strike price of per barrel for a notional amount of  barrels per month over a period of the contract from january  to june  gem did not designate this derivative as a cash flow hedge under sfas this crude oil floor contract is reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  with a fair value of approximately  in september  gem purchased a natural gas floor contract with a strike price of per mmbtu for a notional amount of  mmbtus per month over a period of the contract from january  to june  gem did not designate this derivative as a cash flow hedge under sfas this natural gas floor contract is reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  with a fair value of approximately  interest rate risk consistent with the prior year  we invest cash in interest bearing temporary investments of high quality issuers 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a significant interest rate risk to us 
consistent with the prior year  we consider our interest rate risk exposure related to long term debt obligations to not be material 
as of december  all of our financing obligations carry a fixed interest rate per annum 
we have no open interest rate swap agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk consistent with the prior year  global conducts international business in colombia and is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses and capital expenditures that are denominated in colombian pesos 
however  because predominately all material transactions in global s existing foreign operations are denominated in us dollars  the us dollar is the functional currency for all operations 
consistent with the prior year  exposure from transactions in currencies other than us dollars is not considered material
