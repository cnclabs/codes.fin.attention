company overview we own and operate fm and am radio station clusters serving mid sized markets throughout the united states 
through our investment in cumulus media partners  llc cmp  described below  we will also operate radio station clusters serving large sized markets throughout the united states 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on the number of stations owned or operated 
according to arbitron s market report and data published by miller kaplan  we have assembled market leading groups or clusters of radio stations that rank first or second in terms of revenue share or audience share in substantially all of our markets 
as of december   we owned and operated radio stations in mid sized us media markets and  together with three private equity firms  had formed cmp to acquire radio stations in markets  including san francisco  dallas  houston and atlanta 
in addition  we own and operate a multi market network of five radio stations in the english speaking caribbean 
under our lmas  we currently provide sales and marketing services for two radio stations in two us markets in exchange for a management or consulting fee  pending fcc approval of our acquisitions of these stations 
we will own and operate  directly and through our investment in cmp  a total of stations in us markets upon fcc approval and consummation of all of our pending acquisitions 
our mid market focus 


historically  our strategic focus has been on mid sized markets throughout the united states 
relative to the largest markets in the united states  we believe that the mid sized markets represent attractive operating environments and generally are characterized by a greater use of radio advertising as evidenced by the greater percentage of total media revenues captured by radio than the national average  rising advertising revenues  as the larger national and regional retailers expand into these markets  
table of contents small independent operators  many of whom lack the capital to produce high quality locally originated programming or to employ more sophisticated research  marketing  management and sales techniques  and lower overall susceptibility to economic downturns 
we believe that the attractive operating characteristics of mid sized markets  together with the relaxation of radio station ownership limits under the telecommunications act of the telecom act and fcc rules  have created significant opportunities for growth from the formation of groups of radio stations within these markets 
we have capitalized on these opportunities to acquire attractive properties at favorable purchase prices  taking advantage of the size and fragmented nature of ownership in these markets and to the greater attention historically given to the larger markets by radio station acquirers 
according to the fcc s records  as of december  there were  fm and  am stations in the united states 



and our large market opportunities although our historical focus has been on mid sized radio markets in the united states  we recognize that the large sized radio markets currently provide an attractive combination of scale  stability and opportunity for future growth 
these markets typically have per capita and household income  and expected household after tax effective buying income growth in excess of the national average  according to bia  which we believe makes radio broadcasters in these markets attractive to a broad base of radio advertisers and allows a radio broadcaster to reduce its dependence on any one economic sector or specific advertiser 
in recognition of this  in october we announced the formation of cmp  a newly formed private partnership created by cumulus and affiliates of bain capital partners llc  the blackstone group and thomas h 
lee partners  lp  to acquire the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna pfaltzgraff co 
susquehanna 
cmp has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire susquehanna s radio business for approximately billion  in a transaction expected to be completed in the first half of susquehanna radio is the largest privately owned radio broadcasting company in the united states and the th largest radio station operator in terms of revenue 
the group consists of radio stations in markets san francisco  dallas  houston  atlanta  cincinnati  kansas city  indianapolis and york  pennsylvania

to maximize the advertising revenues and station operating income of our stations  we seek to enhance the quality of radio programs for listeners and the attractiveness of our radio stations to advertisers in a given market 
we also seek to increase the amount of locally originated programming content that airs on each station 
within each market  our stations are diversified in terms of format  target audience and geographic location  enabling us to attract larger and broader listener audiences and thereby a wider range of advertisers 
this diversification  coupled with our competitive advertising pricing  also has provided us with the ability to compete successfully for advertising revenue against other radio  print and television media competitors 
we believe that we are in a position to generate revenue growth  increase audience and revenue shares within our markets and  by capitalizing on economies of scale and by competing against other media for incremental advertising revenue  increase our station operating income growth rates and margins 
some of our markets are still in the development stage with the potential for substantial growth as we implement our operating strategy 
in our more established markets  we believe we have several significant opportunities for growth within our current business model  including growth through maturation of recently reformatted or rebranded stations  and through investment in signal upgrades  which allow for a larger audience reach  for stations that were already strong performers 
we are a delaware corporation  organized in  and successor by merger to an illinois corporation with the same name that had been organized in 
table of contents strategy we are focused on generating internal growth through improvement in station operating income for the portfolio of stations we operate  while enhancing our station portfolio and our business as a whole  through the acquisition of individual stations or clusters that satisfy our acquisition criteria 
operating strategy our operating strategy has the following principal components achieve cost efficiencies associated with common infrastructure and personnel and increase revenue by offering regional coverage of key demographic groups that were previously unavailable to national and regional advertisers  develop each station in our portfolio as a unique enterprise  marketed as an individual  local brand with its own identity  programming content  programming personnel  inventory of time slots and sales force  use audience research and music testing to refine each station s programming content to match the preferences of the station s target demographic audience  in order to enrich our listeners experiences by increasing both the quality and quantity of local programming  and position station clusters to compete with print and television advertising by combining favorable advertising pricing with diverse station formats within each market to draw a larger and broader listening audience to attract a wider range of advertisers 
acquisition strategy our acquisition strategy has the following principal components assemble leading radio station clusters in mid sized markets by taking advantage of their size and fragmented nature ownership  acquire leading stations where we believe we can cost effectively achieve a leading position in terms of signal coverage  revenue or audience share and acquire under performing stations where there is significant potential to apply our management expertise to improve financial and operating performance  and reconfigure our existing stations  or acquire new stations  located near large markets  that based on an engineering analysis of signal specifications and the likelihood of receiving fcc approval  can be redirected  or moved in  to those larger markets 
acquisitions and dispositions completed acquisitions we completed three acquisitions of ten radio stations in four markets and the acquisition of a studio facility during the year ended december  of the million required to fund these acquisitions  million was funded in cash and million represented capitalizable external acquisition costs 
these aggregate acquisition amounts include the assets acquired pursuant to the select transactions highlighted below

cumulus media partners  llc on october   we announced that  together with affiliates of three private equity firms  bain capital partners llc  the blackstone group and thomas h 
lee partners  lp collectively  the sponsors  we formed cmp  which has entered into agreements to acquire the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of and is subject to regulatory approvals  as well as other closing conditions 
in connection with the proposed acquisition  we entered into or will enter into in connection with the consummation of the proposed acquisition various agreements 
first  on october   we and the sponsors entered into a definitive capital contribution agreement with cmp in order to provide for the capitalization of cmp and its subsidiaries 
pursuant to the capital contribution agreement  we will contribute our kansas city  missouri and houston  texas radio operations and assets to cmp  in exchange for an equity stake initially valued at approximately of the equity of cmp 
the sponsors will contribute cash in exchange for the remaining approximately equity stake 
the capitalization of cmp is expected to occur immediately prior to the closing of the susquehanna acquisition  and is contingent on  among other things  satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the acquisition 
also on october   we and the sponsors entered into a limited liability company agreement  which sets forth the terms related to the membership interests to be held by the members of cmp 
cmp was formed to acquire and operate the radio operations of susquehanna and the kansas city and houston radio operations and assets of cumulus  as well as to acquire and operate additional radio broadcasting stations in the top radio broadcast markets in the united states 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement  the distributions by cmp to its members will be calculated according to a formula that values our interest at up to million  or approximately of the equity interests in cmp  subject to achieving certain performance criteria 
in addition  upon the capitalization of cmp and the consummation of the susquehanna acquisition  cumulus and the sponsors  as the equityholders of cmp  will enter into an equityholders agreement with cmp and certain of its subsidiaries  setting forth the transfer restrictions  voting rights and powers of the equityholders with respect to the corporate governance of cmp and its subsidiaries

if cmp declines such an opportunity  then we will have the right to pursue it 
with regard to acquisition opportunities involving other us markets  cmp must allow us the right to pursue first any such opportunity 
additionally  upon the capitalization of cmp and the consummation of the susquehanna acquisition  we will enter into a management agreement with a subsidiary of cmp under which  subject to oversight by the board of directors  we will manage cmp s radio broadcasting operations and corporate development  including management at the corporate level of sales  programming  marketing  technical  finance  accounting  legal  human resources  risk management and information technology  as well as evaluation and consummation of divestitures  acquisitions  swaps  signal upgrades  move ins  and digital radio build out and development

table of contents industry overview the primary source of revenues for radio stations is the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national spot advertisers and national network advertisers 
national spot advertisers assist advertisers in placing their advertisements in a specific market 
national network advertisers place advertisements on a national network show and such advertisements will air in each market where the network has an affiliate 
during the past decade  local advertising revenue as a percentage of total radio advertising revenue in a given market has ranged from approximately to according to the rab 
the growth in total radio advertising revenue tends to be fairly stable 
with the exception of and  when total radio advertising revenue fell by approximately and  respectively  advertising revenue has risen each year since  according to the rab 
radio is considered an efficient  cost effective means of reaching specifically identified demographic groups 
stations are typically classified by their on air format  such as country  rock  adult contemporary  oldies and news talk 
a station s format and style of presentation enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographic features 
by capturing a specific share of a market s radio listening audience  with particular concentration in a targeted demographic  a station is able to market its broadcasting time to advertisers seeking to reach a specific audience 
advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services  such as arbitron  to estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings are limited in part by the format of a particular station and the local competitive environment 
although the number of advertisements broadcast during a given time period may vary  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
a station s local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses 
to generate national advertising sales  a station usually will engage a firm that specializes in soliciting radio advertising sales on a national level 
national sales representatives obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the station s market and receive commissions based on the revenue from the advertising they obtain 
our stations compete for advertising revenue with other terrestrial based radio stations in the market including low power fm radio stations that are required to operate on a noncommercial basis as well as other media  including newspapers  broadcast television  cable television  magazines  direct mail  coupons and outdoor advertising 
in addition  the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from services that use new media technologies that are being developed or have already been introduced  such as the internet and satellite based digital radio services 
such services reach nationwide and regional audiences with multi channel  multi format  digital radio services that have a sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs 
competition among terrestrial based radio stations has also been heightened by the introduction of terrestrial digital audio broadcasting which is digital audio broadcasting delivered through earth based equipment rather than satellites 
the fcc currently allows terrestrial radio stations like ours to commence the use of digital technology through a hybrid antenna that carries both the pre existing analog signal and the new digital signal 
the fcc is conducting a proceeding that could result in a radio station s use of two antennae one for the analog signal and one for the digital signal 
we cannot predict how existing or new sources of competition will affect the revenues generated by our stations 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  such as television broadcasting  cable television  audio tapes and compact discs 
a growing population and greater availability of radios  particularly car and portable radios  have contributed to this growth 
there can be no assurance  however  that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry in general or our stations in particular 

table of contents advertising sales virtually all of our revenue is generated from the sale of local  regional and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
approximately  and of our net broadcasting revenue was generated from the sale of local and regional advertising in  and  respectively 
additional broadcasting revenue is generated from the sale of national advertising 
the major categories of our advertisers include automotive dealers telecommunications banking and mortgage amusement and recreation food services and drinking arts and entertainment healthcare services food and beverage stores furniture and home furnishings each station s local sales staff solicits advertising either directly from the local advertiser or indirectly through an advertising agency 
we employ a tiered commission structure to focus our individual sales staffs on new business development 
consistent with our operating strategy of dedicated sales forces for each of our stations  we have also increased the number of salespeople per station 
we believe that we can outperform the traditional growth rates of our markets by expanding our base of advertisers  training newly hired sales people and providing a higher level of service to our existing customer base 
this requires larger sales staffs than most of the stations employ at the time they are acquired by cumulus 
we support our strategy of building local direct accounts by employing personnel in each of our markets to produce custom commercials that respond to the needs of our advertisers 
in addition  in house production provides advertisers greater flexibility in changing their commercial messages with minimal lead time 
our national sales are made by katz communications  inc  a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level  in exchange for a commission that is based on our net revenue from the advertising obtained 
regional sales  which we define as sales in regions surrounding our markets to buyers that advertise in our markets  are generally made by our local sales staff and market managers 
whereas we seek to grow our local sales through larger and more customer focused sales staffs  we seek to grow our national and regional sales by offering to key national and regional advertisers groups of stations within specific markets and regions that make our stations more attractive 
many of these large accounts have previously been reluctant to advertise in these markets because of the logistics involved in buying advertising from individual stations 
certain of our stations had no national representation before we acquired them 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings are limited in part by the format of a particular station 
we estimate the optimal number of advertisements available for sale depending on the programming format of a particular station 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory that it makes available for advertising 
this target level of inventory for sale may be different at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand 
we seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our cluster of stations  thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
our selling and pricing activity is based on demand for our radio stations on air inventory and  in general  we respond to this demand by varying prices rather than by varying our target inventory level for a particular station 
most changes in revenue are explained by some combination of demand driven pricing changes and changes in inventory utilization rather than by changes in the available inventory 
advertising rates charged by radio stations  which are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours  are based primarily on a station s share of audiences generally  and in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured by ratings surveys  
table of contents the supply of and demand for radio advertising time generally and for time targeted at particular demographic groups  and certain additional qualitative factors 
a station s listenership is reflected in ratings surveys that estimate the number of listeners tuned to the station and the time they spend listening 
each station s ratings are used by its advertisers and advertising representatives to consider advertising with the station and are used by cumulus to chart audience growth  set advertising rates and adjust programming 
the radio broadcast industry s principal ratings service is arbitron  which publishes periodic ratings surveys for significant domestic radio markets 
these surveys are our primary source of ratings data 
we have an agreement with arbitron that gives us access to arbitron s ratings materials in a majority of our markets through july competition the radio broadcasting industry is very competitive 
the success of each of our stations depends largely upon its audience ratings and its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
our audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to change  and any adverse change in a particular market affecting advertising expenditures or an adverse change in the relative market share of the stations located in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our radio stations located in that market 
there can be no assurance that any one or all of our stations will be able to maintain or increase current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share 
our stations  including those to be acquired upon completion of the pending acquisitions  compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets  as well as with other advertising media as discussed below 
radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group 
by building a strong brand identity with a targeted listener base consisting of specific demographic groups in each of our markets  we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners 
companies that operate radio stations must be alert to the possibility of another station changing its format to compete directly for listeners and advertisers 
another station s decision to convert to a format similar to that of one of our radio stations in the same geographic area or to launch an aggressive promotional campaign may result in lower ratings and advertising revenue  increased promotion and other expenses and  consequently  lower our station operating income 
factors that are material to a radio station s competitive position include station brand identity and loyalty  management experience  the station s local audience rank in its market  transmitter power and location  assigned frequency  audience characteristics  local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other radio stations and other advertising media in the market area 
we attempt to improve our competitive position in each market by extensively researching and improving our stations programming  by implementing advertising campaigns aimed at the demographic groups for which our stations program and by managing our sales efforts to attract a larger share of advertising dollars for each station individually 
however  we compete with some organizations that have substantially greater financial or other resources than we do 
in  changes in federal law and fcc rules dramatically increased the number of radio stations a single party can own and operate in a local market 
our management continues to believe that companies that elect to take advantage of those changes by forming groups of commonly owned stations or joint arrangements such as lmas in a particular market may  in certain circumstances  have lower operating costs and may be able to offer advertisers in those markets more attractive rates and services 
although we currently operate multiple stations in each of our markets and intend to pursue the creation of additional multiple station groups in particular markets  our competitors in certain markets include other parties who own and operate as many or more stations than we do 
we may also compete with those other parties or broadcast groups for the purchase of additional stations in those markets or new markets 
some of those 
table of contents other parties and groups are owned or operated by companies that have substantially greater financial or other resources than we do 
a radio station s competitive position can be enhanced by a variety of factors  including changes in the station s format and an upgrade of the station s authorized power 
however  the competitive position of existing radio stations is protected to some extent by certain regulatory barriers to new entrants 
the operation of a radio broadcast station requires an fcc license  and the number of radio stations that an entity can operate in a given market is limited 
under fcc rules that became effective in  the number of radio stations that a party can own in a particular market is dictated largely by whether the station is in a defined arbitron metro a designation designed by a private party for use in advertising matters  and  if so  the number of stations included in that arbitron metro 
in those markets that are not in an arbitron metro  the number of stations a party can own in the particular market is dictated by the number of am and fm signals that together comprise that fcc defined radio market 
for a discussion of fcc regulation including recent changes  see federal regulation of radio broadcasting 
our stations also compete for advertising revenue with other media  including low power fm radio stations that are required to operate on a noncommercial basis  newspapers  broadcast television  cable and satellite television  magazines  direct mail  coupons and outdoor advertising 
in addition  the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from companies that use new media technologies that are being developed or have already been introduced  such as the internet and the delivery of digital audio programming by cable television systems  by satellite radio carriers  and by terrestrial based radio stations that broadcast digital audio signals 
the fcc has authorized two companies to provide a digital audio programming service by satellite to nationwide audiences with a multi channel  multi format and with sound quality equivalent to that of compact discs 
the fcc has also authorized fm terrestrial stations like ours to use two separate antennae to deliver both the current analog radio signal and a new digital signal 
the fcc is also exploring the possibility of allowing am stations to deliver both analog and digital signals 
we cannot predict how new sources of competition will affect our performance and income 
the radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information  such as television broadcasting  cable television  audio tapes and compact discs 
a growing population and greater availability of radios  particularly car and portable radios  have contributed to this growth 
there can be no assurance  however  that the development or introduction in the future of any new media technology will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcasting industry in general or our stations in particular 
we cannot predict what other matters might be considered in the future by the fcc or congress  nor can we assess in advance what impact  if any  the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business 
employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we employ various on air personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets 
on occasion  we enter into employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of one or more of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share  but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  taken as a whole 
we generally employ one market manager for each radio market in which we own or operate stations 
each market manager is responsible for all employees of the market and for managing all aspects of the radio operations 
on occasion  we enter into employment agreements with market managers to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of a market manager could result in 
table of contents a short term loss of performance in a market  but we do not believe that any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  taken as a whole 
federal regulation of radio broadcasting general 
the ownership  operation and sale of radio broadcast stations  including those licensed to us  are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc  which acts under authority derived from the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the telecom act amended the communications act and directed the fcc to change certain of its broadcast rules 
among its other regulatory responsibilities  the fcc issues permits and licenses to construct and operate radio stations  assigns broadcast frequencies  determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates transmission equipment  operating power  and other technical parameters of stations  adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership  operation and employment practices of stations  regulates the content of some forms of radio broadcast programming  and has the authority under the communications act to impose penalties for violations of its rules 
the following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act  the telecom act  and related fcc rules and policies collectively  the communications laws 
this description does not purport to be comprehensive  and reference should be made to the communications laws  public notices  and decisions issued by the fcc for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio broadcast stations 
failure to observe the provisions of the communications laws can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures and the grant of a short term less than the maximum term license renewal 
for particularly egregious violations  the fcc may deny a station s license renewal application  revoke a station s license  or deny applications in which an applicant seeks to acquire additional broadcast properties 
license grant and renewal 
radio broadcast licenses are generally granted and renewed for maximum terms of eight years 
licenses are renewed by filing an application with the fcc 
petitions to deny license renewal applications may be filed by interested parties  including members of the public 
we are not currently aware of any facts that would prevent the timely renewal of our licenses to operate our radio stations  although there can be no assurance that each of our licenses will be renewed for a full term without adverse conditions 
service areas 
the area served by am stations is determined by a combination of frequency  transmitter power  antenna orientation  and soil conductivity 
to determine the effective service area of an am station  the station s power  operating frequency  antenna patterns and its day night operating modes are required 
the area served by an fm station is determined by a combination of transmitter power and antenna height  with stations divided into classes according to these technical parameters 
class c fm stations operate with the equivalent of kilowatts of effective radiated power erp at an antenna height of up to  feet above average terrain 
they are the most powerful fm stations  providing service to a large area  typically covering one or more counties within a state 
class b fm stations operate with the equivalent of kilowatts erp at an antenna height of up to feet above average terrain 
class b stations typically serve large metropolitan areas as well as their associated suburbs 
class a fm stations operate with the equivalent of kilowatts erp at an antenna height of up to feet above average terrain  and generally serve smaller cities and towns or suburbs of larger cities 
the minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an fm station are determined by its class 
fm class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the fm station is located 
in general  commercial fm stations are classified as follows  in order of increasing power and antenna height class a  b  c  b  c  c  c  and c

we also own and operate five radio stations in various locations throughout the english speaking eastern caribbean  including trinidad  st 
kitts nevis  st 
lucia  montserrat and antigua barbuda  and we have been granted licenses for fm stations covering barbados and tortola  british virgin islands 
these eastern caribbean stations are not regulated by the fcc 
regulatory approvals 
the communications laws prohibit the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license without the prior approval of the fcc 
in determining whether to grant an application for assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license  the communications act requires the fcc to find that the assignment or transfer would serve the public interest 
the fcc considers a number of factors in making this determination  including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties  the financial and character qualifications of the assignee or transferee including those parties holding an attributable interest in the assignee or transferee  compliance with the communications act s foreign ownership restrictions  and compliance with other communications laws  including those related to programming and filing requirements 
as discussed in greater detail below  the fcc also reviews the effect of proposed assignments and transfers of broadcast licenses on economic competition and diversity 
see antitrust and market concentration considerations 

table of contents two of our transactions that are pending at the fcc have been challenged by third parties 
in one transaction  an application is pending before the fcc with respect to our proposed sale of an am station in muskegon  michigan 
the fcc staff has raised a question concerning a prior owner s proposed retention of a related authorization for that station  and the prior owner  in turn  has raised questions about our conduct in acquiring the station 
in another transaction  we have four assignment applications pending before the fcc by which we are seeking to exchange two fm stations in the ft 
walton beach  florida market for two other stations one of which is in the ft 
walton beach market and one of which has fcc authorization to relocate to the ft 
walton beach market 
those applications have been challenged by a third party who has raised multiple ownership and ownership concentration issues 
we cannot predict the final outcome of the foregoing matters but we do not believe that any adverse decision in either case will have a material adverse impact on our overall operations taken as a whole 
ownership matters 
the communications act restricts us from having more than one fourth of our capital stock owned or voted by non us persons  foreign governments or non us corporations 
we are required to take appropriate steps to monitor the citizenship of our stockholders  such as through representative samplings on a periodic basis  to provide a reasonable basis for certifying compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions of the communications act 
the communications laws also generally restrict the number of radio stations one person or entity may own  operate or control in a local market  the common ownership  operation or control of radio broadcast stations and television broadcast stations serving the same local market  and the common ownership  operation or control of a radio broadcast station and a daily newspaper serving the same local market 
none of these multiple and cross ownership rules requires any change in our current ownership of radio broadcast stations or precludes consummation of our pending acquisitions 
the communications laws will limit the number of additional stations that we may acquire in the future in our existing markets as well as new markets 
because of these multiple and cross ownership rules  a purchaser of our voting stock who acquires an attributable interest in us as discussed below may violate the communications laws if such purchaser also has an attributable interest in other radio or television stations  or in daily newspapers  depending on the number and location of those radio or television stations or daily newspapers 
such a purchaser also may be restricted in the companies in which it may invest to the extent that those investments give rise to an attributable interest 
if one of our attributable stockholders violates any of these ownership rules  we may be unable to obtain from the fcc one or more authorizations needed to conduct our radio station business and may be unable to obtain fcc consents for certain future acquisitions 
the fcc generally applies its television radio newspaper cross ownership rules and its broadcast multiple ownership rules by considering the attributable or cognizable  interests held by a person or entity 
with some exceptions  a person or entity will be deemed to hold an attributable interest in a radio station  television station or daily newspaper if the person or entity serves as an officer  director  partner  stockholder  member  or  in certain cases  a debt holder of a company that owns that station or newspaper 
whether that interest is attributable and thus subject to the fcc s multiple ownership rules is determined by the fcc s attribution rules 
if an interest is attributable  the fcc treats the person or entity who holds that interest as the owner of the radio station  television station or daily newspaper in question  and that interest thus counts against the person in determining compliance with the fcc s ownership rules 
with respect to a corporation  officers  directors and persons or entities that directly or indirectly hold or more of the corporation s voting stock or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies  investment companies  bank trust departments and certain other passive investors that hold such stock for investment purposes only generally are attributed with ownership of the radio stations  television stations and daily newspapers owned by the corporation 
as discussed below  participation in an lma or a jsa also may result in an attributable interest 
see local marketing agreements and joint sales agreements 

table of contents with respect to a partnership or limited liability company  the interest of a general partner is attributable  as is the interest of any limited partner or limited liability company member who is materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or limited liability company 
the following interests generally are not attributable debt instruments  non voting stock  options and warrants for voting stock  partnership interests  or membership interests that have not yet been exercised  limited partnership or limited liability company interests where a the limited partner or member is not materially involved in the media related activities of the partnership or limited liability company  and b the limited partnership agreement or limited liability company agreement expressly insulates the limited partner or member from such material involvement by inclusion of provisions specified by the fcc  and holders of less than of an entity s voting stock 
non voting equity and debt interests which  in the aggregate  constitute more than of a station s enterprise value  which consists of the total equity and debt capitalization  are considered attributable in certain circumstances 
on june   the fcc adopted new rules and policies the new rules which would modify the ownership rules and policies then in effect the current rules 
among other changes  the new rules would change the methodology to determine the boundaries of radio markets  require that jsas involving radio stations but not television stations be deemed to be an attributable ownership interest under certain circumstances  authorize the common ownership of radio stations and daily newspapers under certain specified circumstances  and eliminate the procedural policy of flagging assignment or transfer of control applications that raised potential anticompetitive concerns namely  those applications that would permit the buyer to control or more of the radio advertising dollars in the market  or would permit two entities including the buyer  collectively  to control or more of the radio advertising dollars in the market 
certain private parties challenged the new rules in court  and the court issued an order which prevented the new rules from going into effect until the court issued a decision on the challenges 
on june   the court issued a decision which upheld some of the fcc s new rules for the most part  those that relate to radio and concluded that other new rules for the most part  those that relate to television and newspapers required further explanation or modification 
the court left in place  however  the order which precluded all of the new rules from going into effect 
on september   the court issued a further order which granted the fcc s request to allow certain new rules relating to radio to go into effect 
the new rules that became effective changed the definition of the radio market for those markets that are rated by arbitron  modified the current rules method for defining a radio market in those markets that are not rated by arbitron  and made jsas an attributable ownership interest under certain circumstances 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
broadcasters are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems  needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness 
complaints from listeners concerning a station s programming may be filed at any time and will be considered by the fcc both at the time they are filed and in connection with a licensee s renewal application 
stations also must follow various fcc rules that regulate  among other things  political advertising  the broadcast of obscene or indecent programming  sponsorship identification  the broadcast of contests and lotteries  and technical operations including limits on radio frequency radiation 
failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions  including monetary forfeitures  the grant of a short term less than the maximum term license renewal or  for particularly egregious violations  the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a station license 
local marketing agreements 
a number of radio stations  including certain of our stations  have entered into lmas 
in a typical lma  the licensee of a station makes available  for a fee  airtime on its station to a party which supplies programming to be broadcast during that airtime  and collects revenues from advertising aired during such programming 
lmas are subject to compliance with the antitrust laws and the communications laws  including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and  in particular  its personnel  programming  and finances 
the fcc has held that such agreements do not violate the communications laws as long as the licensee of the station 
table of contents receiving programming from another station maintains ultimate responsibility for  and control over  station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the communications laws 
a station that brokers more than of the weekly programming hours on another station in its market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the fcc s ownership rules 
as a result  a radio station may not enter into an lma that allows it to program more than of the weekly programming hours of another station in the same market that it could not own under the fcc s multiple ownership rules 
joint sales agreements 
from time to time  radio stations  including one of our stations  enter into jsas 
a typical jsa authorizes one station to sell another station s advertising time and retain the revenue from the sale of that airtime 
a jsa typically includes a periodic payment to the station whose airtime is being sold which may include a share of the revenue being collected from the sale of airtime 
like lmas  jsas are subject to compliance with antitrust laws and the communications laws  including the requirement that the licensee must maintain independent control over the station and  in particular  its personnel  programming  and finances 
the fcc has held that such agreements do not violate the communications laws as long as the licensee of the station whose time is being sold by another station maintains ultimate responsibility for  and control over  station operations and otherwise ensures compliance with the communications laws 
under the fcc s new rules  a radio station that sells more than of the weekly advertising time of another radio station in the same market will be attributed with the ownership of that other station 
in that situation  a radio station cannot have a jsa with another radio station in the same market if the fcc s ownership rules would otherwise prohibit that common ownership 
new services 
in  the fcc awarded two licenses to separate entities that authorize the licensees to provide satellite delivered digital audio radio services 
both licensees have launched their respective satellite delivered digital radio service 
digital technology also may be used by terrestrial radio broadcast stations on their existing frequencies 
in october  the fcc released a report and order in which it selected in band  on channel iboc as the technology that will permit terrestrial radio stations to introduce digital operations 
the fcc now will permit operating radio stations to commence digital operation immediately on an interim basis using the iboc systems developed by ibiquity digital corporation ibiquity  called hd radio tm 
in march  the fcc approved an fm radio station s use of two separate antennas as opposed to a single hybrid antenna to provide both analog and digital signals and released a public notice seeking comment on a proposal by the national association of broadcasters to allow all am stations with nighttime service to provide digital service at night 
in april  the fcc inaugurated a rule making proceeding to establish technical  service  and licensing rules for digital broadcasting 
the inauguration of digital broadcasts by fm and perhaps am stations requires us to make additional expenditures 
on december   we entered into an agreement with ibiquity pursuant to which we committed to implement hd radio tm systems on of our stations by june  in exchange for reduced license fees and other consideration  we  along with other broadcasters  purchased perpetual licenses to utilize ibiquity s hd radio tm technology 
we are presently working with equipment manufacturers to roll out such technology within our markets in accordance with our contractual commitments 
we cannot predict at this juncture  however  how successful our implementation of hd radio tm technology within our platform will be  or how that implementation will affect our competitive position 
in january  the fcc released a report and order adopting rules for a new low power fm radio service consisting of two classes of stations  one with a maximum power of watts and the other with a maximum power of watts 
the fcc has limited ownership and operation of low power fm stations to persons and entities which do not currently have an attributable interest in any fm station and has required that low power fm stations be operated on a non commercial educational basis 
the fcc has granted numerous construction permits for low power fm stations 
we cannot predict what impact low power fm radio will have on our operations 
adverse effects of the new low power fm service on our 
table of contents operations could include interference with our stations and competition by low power stations for listeners and revenues 
in addition  from time to time congress and the fcc have considered  and may in the future consider and adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could  directly or indirectly  affect the operation  ownership and profitability of our radio stations  result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations  and affect the ability of cumulus to acquire additional radio stations or finance such acquisitions 
antitrust and market concentration considerations 
potential future acquisitions  to the extent they meet specified size thresholds  will be subject to applicable waiting periods and possible review under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the hsr act  by the department of justice or the federal trade commission  either of whom can be required to evaluate a transaction to determine whether that transaction should be challenged under the federal antitrust laws 
transactions are subject to the hsr act only if the acquisition price or fair market value of the stations to be acquired is million or more 
most of our acquisitions have not met this threshold 
acquisitions that are not required to be reported under the hsr act may still be investigated by the department of justice or the federal trade commission under the antitrust laws before or after consummation 
at any time before or after the consummation of a proposed acquisition  the department of justice or the federal trade commission could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary  including seeking to enjoin the acquisition or seeking divestiture of the business acquired or certain of our other assets 
the department of justice has reviewed numerous radio station acquisitions where an operator proposes to acquire additional stations in its existing markets or multiple stations in new markets  and has challenged a number of such transactions 
some of these challenges have resulted in consent decrees requiring the sale of certain stations  the termination of lmas or other relief 
in general  the department of justice has more closely scrutinized radio mergers and acquisitions resulting in local market shares in excess of of local radio advertising revenues  depending on format  signal strength and other factors 
there is no precise numerical rule  however  and certain transactions resulting in more than revenue shares have not been challenged  while certain other transactions may be challenged based on other criteria such as audience shares in one or more demographic groups as well as the percentage of revenue share 
we estimate that we have more than a share of radio advertising revenues in many of our markets 
we are aware that the department of justice commenced  and subsequently discontinued  investigations of several of our prior acquisitions 
in addition  it has most recently requested information regarding our proposed acquisition of two radio stations in ft 
walton beach  florida 
the department of justice can be expected to continue to enforce the antitrust laws in this manner  and there can be no assurance that one or more of our pending or future acquisitions are not or will not be the subject of an investigation or enforcement action by the department of justice or the federal trade commission 
similarly  there can be no assurance that the department of justice  the federal trade commission or the fcc will not prohibit such acquisitions  require that they be restructured  or in appropriate cases  require that we divest stations we already own in a particular market 
in addition  private parties may under certain circumstances bring legal action to challenge an acquisition under the antitrust laws 
as part of its review of certain radio station acquisitions  the department of justice has stated publicly that it believes that commencement of operations under lmas  jsas and other similar agreements customarily entered into in connection with radio station ownership transfers prior to the expiration of the waiting period under the hsr act could violate the hsr act 
in connection with acquisitions subject to the waiting period under the hsr act  we will not commence operation of any affected station to be acquired under an lma  a jsa  or similar agreement until the waiting period has expired or been terminated

risk factors many statements contained in this report are forward looking in nature 
these statements are based on our current plans  intentions or expectations  and actual results could differ materially as we cannot guarantee that we will achieve these plans  intentions or expectations 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those specifically identified below 
risks related to our business we operate in a very competitive business environment 
the radio broadcasting industry is very competitive 
our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets  and some of the owners of those competing stations may have greater financial resources than we do 
our stations also compete with other media  such as newspapers  magazines  cable and broadcast television  outdoor advertising  satellite radio  the internet and direct mail 
in addition  many of our stations compete with groups of two or more radio stations operated by a single operator in the same market 
audience ratings and market shares fluctuate  and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of stations located in that market 
while we already compete with other stations with comparable programming formats in many of our markets  any one of our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings or revenue and could require increased promotion and other expenses  and  consequently  could have a lower station operating income  if another radio station in the market were to convert its programming format to a format similar to our station or launch aggressive promotional campaigns  a new station were to adopt a competitive format  or an existing competitor were to strengthen its operations 
the telecom act allows for the consolidation of ownership of radio broadcasting stations in the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future 
some competing consolidated owners may be larger and have substantially more financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  increased consolidation in our target markets may result in greater competition for acquisition properties and a corresponding increase in purchase prices we pay for these properties 
a decrease in our market ratings or market share can adversely affect our revenues 
the success of each of our radio stations  or station clusters  is primarily dependent upon its share of the overall advertising revenue within its market 
although we believe that each of our stations or clusters can compete effectively in its market  we cannot be sure that any of our stations can maintain or increase its current audience ratings or market share 
in addition to competition from other radio stations and other media  shifts in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control could cause us to lose our audience ratings or market share 
our advertising revenue may suffer if any of our stations cannot maintain its audience ratings or market share 
we must respond to the rapid changes in technology  services and standards that characterize our industry in order to remain competitive 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services 
in some cases  our ability to compete will be dependent on our acquisition of new technologies and our provision of new services  and we cannot assure you that we will have the resources to acquire those new technologies or provide those new services  in 
table of contents other cases  the introduction of new technologies and services could increase competition and have an adverse effect on our revenue 
recent new media technologies and services include the following audio programming by cable television systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers both landline and wireless  internet based audio radio services  satellite delivered digital audio radio service and other digital audio broadcast formats  hd radio tm digital radio  which could provide multi channel  multi format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional am and fm radio services  and low power fm radio  which could result in additional fm radio broadcast stations in markets where we have stations 
we also cannot assure you that we will continue to have the resources to acquire other new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with other new technologies 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that competition arising from new technologies may have on the radio broadcasting industry or on our business 
we face many unpredictable business risks that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
our operations are subject to many business risks  including certain risks that specifically influence the radio broadcasting industry 
these include changing economic conditions  both generally and relative to the radio broadcasting industry in particular  shifts in population  listenership  demographics or audience tastes  the level of competition from existing or future technologies for advertising revenues  including  but not limited to  other radio stations  satellite radio  television stations  newspapers  the internet  and other entertainment and communications media  and changes in laws as well as changes in governmental regulations and policies and actions of federal regulatory bodies  including the us department of justice  the federal trade commission and the fcc 
given the inherent unpredictability of these variables  we cannot with any degree of certainty predict what effect  if any  these risks will have on our future operations 
any one or more of these variables may have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
there are risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue to grow through internal expansion and by acquiring radio station clusters and individual radio stations primarily in mid size markets 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing these acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions will be 
consummation of our pending acquisitions and any acquisitions in the future are subject to various conditions  such as compliance with fcc and antitrust regulatory requirements 
the fcc requirements include approval of license assignments and transfers  limits on the number of stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market  and other rules or policies  such as the ownership attribution rules  that could limit our ability to acquire stations in certain markets where one or more of our stockholders has other media interests 
the antitrust regulatory requirements include filing with the us department of justice and the federal trade commission under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  referred to as the hsr act  where applicable  
table of contents expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act  and possible review by the us department of justice or the federal trade commission of antitrust issues under the hsr act or otherwise 
we cannot be certain that any of these conditions will be satisfied 
in addition  the fcc has asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process  even where proposed assignments would comply with the numerical limits on local radio station ownership in the fcc s rules and the communications act of  referred to as the communications act 
our acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks  including risks associated with identifying acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms  integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations  diverting our management s attention from other business concerns  potentially losing key employees at acquired stations  and the diminishing number of properties available for sale in mid size markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions or manage the resulting business effectively  or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate 
in addition  we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous acquisitions 
depending upon the nature  size and timing of potential future acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional financing in order to consummate additional acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that our debt agreements will permit the necessary additional financing or that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that financing would be on terms acceptable to our management 
we may be restricted in pursuing certain strategic acquisitions because of our agreement with cmp 
under an agreement that we will enter into with cmp and the other investors in cmp in connection with the formation of cmp  we have agreed to allow cmp the right to pursue first any business opportunity primarily involving the top radio markets in the united states 
we are allowed to pursue such business opportunities only after cmp has declined to pursue them 
as a result  we may be limited in our ability to pursue strategic acquisitions or alternatives primarily involving large sized markets including opportunities that primarily involve large sized markets but also involve mid sized markets that may present attractive opportunities for us in the future 
we have written off  and could in the future be required to write off  a significant portion of the fair market value of our fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   our fcc licenses and goodwill comprise of our assets 
each year  we are required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to assess the fair market value of our fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill to determine whether the fair market value of those assets is impaired 
in  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
our future impairment reviews could result in additional impairment charges 
such additional impairment charges would reduce our reported earnings for the periods in which they are recorded 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by a downturn in the us economy or in the economies of the markets in which we operate 
revenue generated by our radio stations depends primarily upon the sale of advertising 
advertising expenditures  which we believe to be largely a discretionary business expense  generally tend to decline 
table of contents during an economic recession or downturn 
furthermore  because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers  our ability to generate advertising revenue in specific markets is directly affected by local or regional economic conditions 
consequently  a recession or downturn in the national economy or the economy of an individual geographic market in which we own or operate stations could adversely affect our advertising revenue and  therefore  our results of operations 
our broadcasting revenues could be materially adversely affected by recessions  which may be triggered by economic forces such as the business cycle or by cataclysmic human events 
future acts of war and terrorism against the united states  and the country s response thereto  could cause our advertising revenues to decline due to advertising cancellations  delays or defaults in payment for advertising time  and the adverse impact on the general economic activity in the united states 
even in the absence of a general recession or downturn in the economy  an individual business sector that tends to spend more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce its advertising expenditures if that sector experiences a downturn 
if that sector s spending represents a significant portion of our advertising revenues  any reduction in its expenditures may affect our revenue 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel  and our loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to expand  train and manage our employee base 
we have entered into employment agreements with some of our key management personnel that include provisions restricting their ability to compete with us under specified circumstances 
we also employ several on air personalities with large loyal audiences in their individual markets 
on occasion  we enter into employment agreements with these personalities to protect our interests in those relationships that we believe to be valuable 
the loss of one or more of these personalities could result in a short term loss of audience share in that particular market 
the broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing federal regulation 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the fcc under the communications act of we are required to obtain licenses from the fcc to operate our stations 
licenses are normally granted for a term of eight years and are renewable 
although the vast majority of fcc radio station licenses are routinely renewed  we cannot assure you that the fcc will grant our existing or future renewal applications or that the renewals will not include conditions out of the ordinary course 
the non renewal or renewal with conditions  of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must also comply with the extensive fcc regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of our radio stations 
fcc regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market  which could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations that would be material to our financial performance in a particular market or overall 
the fcc also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations 
despite those limitations  a dispute could arise whether another station is improperly interfering with the operation of one of our stations or another radio licensee could complain to the fcc that one our stations is improperly interfering with that licensee s station 
there can be no assurance as to how the fcc might resolve that dispute 
these fcc regulations and others may change over time  and we cannot assure you that those changes would not have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents in recent years  the fcc has engaged in more vigorous enforcement of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
fcc regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time  and indecent material between the hours of am and am the fcc has recently increased its enforcement efforts with respect to these regulations 
further  congress has introduced legislation that would substantially increase the penalties for broadcasting indecent programming and potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation  renewal or qualification proceedings in the event that they broadcast indecent material 
we may in the future become subject to inquiries or proceedings related to our stations broadcast of allegedly indecent or obscene material 
to the extent that such an inquiry or proceeding results in the imposition of fines  a settlement with the fcc  revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications  our results of operation and business could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to obtain prior fcc approval for each radio station acquisition 
the acquisition of a radio station requires the prior approval of the fcc 
to obtain that approval  we would have to file a transfer of control or assignment application with the fcc 
the communications act and fcc rules allow members of the public and other interested parties to file petitions to deny or other objections to the fcc grant of any transfer or assignment application 
the fcc could rely on those objections or its own initiative to deny a transfer or assignment application or to require changes in the transaction as a condition to having the application granted 
the fcc could also change its existing rules and policies to reduce the number of stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets 
for these and other reasons  there can be no assurance that the fcc will approve potential future acquisitions that we deem material to our business 
risks related to our indebtedness we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business  remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness 
as of december   our long term debt  including the current portion  was million  representing approximately of our stockholders equity 
our credit facilities have interest and principal repayment obligations that are substantial in amount 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences for you  including requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations  capital expenditures and future business opportunities  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  increasing our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt 
restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non strategic divestitures  we and our restricted subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  subject to the restrictions contained in our credit facilities 
if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 

table of contents the credit agreement governing our credit facility imposes significant restrictions on us 
our credit agreement limits or restricts  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness or grant additional liens or security interests in our assets  pay dividends  make payments on certain types of indebtedness or make other restricted payments  make particular types of investments or enter into speculative hedging agreements  enter into some types of transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with any other person or make changes to our organizational documents or other material agreement to which we are a party  sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of our assets except within certain limits or enter into sale leaseback transactions  or make capital expenditures 
our credit agreement also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot be sure that we will maintain those ratios or meet those tests 
a breach of any of these restrictions could result in a default under our debt agreements 
our lenders have taken security interests in substantially all of our consolidated assets  and we have pledged the stock of our subsidiaries to secure the debt under our credit facility 
if an event of default under our credit agreement occurs  our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding  including accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
if we could not repay those amounts  those lenders could proceed against the collateral pledged to them to secure that indebtedness 
if our credit facility indebtedness were accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement will depend upon our future performance and various other factors  such as business  competitive  technological  legislative and regulatory factors  some of which are beyond our control 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement  our lenders could declare all amounts owed to them immediately due and payable

risk factors 
overview of the advertising environment for was generally weaker then in the rab has reported that radio revenue growth for was essentially flat compared to the prior year  with locally derived revenues growing approximately  offset by a decrease in national revenues 
nevertheless  for  our revenue performance outpaced the industry with total pro forma net revenues increasing see the explanation of how we calculated our pro forma results and a reconciliation of pro forma results to our historical results under results of operations in this section 
our local revenue stream has remained consistently strong  with pro forma local net revenue growing 
we attribute this strength to our previous investments in our local sales forces and the strong ratings and revenue share positions we enjoy in most of our markets 
the consistent success on the local revenue side of our business  however  was offset for by weakness in national revenue 
for  our pro forma net national revenues were down versus the prior year 
political revenues realized in connection with the election year contributed approximately one third of the decrease for also during  the home depot  which was a significant national advertiser in  realigned its marketing efforts away from national radio advertising 
the loss of this account significantly impacted our national revenues  along with national revenues across the industry 
in may  we switched national sales representation firms to katz media group 
since the switch  we have already seen improvements in our national revenue stream  attributable to the systems and resources employed by katz 
we believe that as our relationship with katz continues  we will be able to achieve greater improvement in our national revenue stream 
our management team remains focused on our strategy of pursuing growth through acquisition 
however  acquisitions are closely evaluated to ensure that they will generate stockholder value and our management is committed to completing only those acquisitions that we believe will increase our share price 
the compression of publicly traded radio broadcast company multiples in  combined with a market for privately held radio stations that did not see a corresponding multiples compression  translated to minimal acquisition activity for us in absent suitable acquisition opportunities  our board authorized us to purchase shares of our class a common stock 
during and  we completed our first million of share repurchases  pursuant to a board authorized  million share purchase program 
in december  our board authorized a second million share purchase program  which we intend to implement prudently  within the limits set forth under our credit agreement and over a time frame that will mitigate any factors that would otherwise increase our leverage levels 
during  we secured a new  million credit facility that increased our borrowing capacity  lowered our effective interest rates and increased our overall flexibility with respect to potential acquisitions or share repurchases 
as of december   our average cost of debt  including the effects of our derivative positions  was 
we remain committed to maintaining manageable debt levels  which will continue to improve our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
our business we own and operate fm and am radio station clusters serving mid sized markets throughout the united states 
through our investment in cmp  we will also operate radio station clusters serving large sized markets throughout the united states 
we are the second largest radio broadcasting company in the united states based on the number of stations owned or operated 
according to arbitron s market report 
table of contents and data published by miller kaplan  we have assembled market leading groups or clusters of radio stations that rank first or second in terms of revenue share or audience share in substantially all of our markets 
as of december   we owned and operated radio stations in mid sized us media markets and  together with three private equity firms  had formed cmp to acquire radio stations in markets  including san francisco  dallas  houston and atlanta 
in addition  we own and operate a multi market network of five radio stations in the english speaking caribbean 
under our lmas  we currently provide sales and marketing services for two radio stations in two us markets in exchange for a management or consulting fee  pending fcc approval of our acquisitions of these stations 
we will own and operate  directly and through our investment in cmp  a total of stations in us markets upon fcc approval and consummation of all of our pending acquisitions 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations includes the results of these acquisitions and local marketing  management and consulting agreements 
advertising revenue and station operating income our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by arbitron on a periodic basis  generally two or four times per year 
because audience ratings in local markets are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices based upon local market conditions 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
our use of trade agreements resulted in immaterial operating income expense during the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
we continually seek to minimize our use of trade agreements 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
during the years ended december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were from local advertising 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter will produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the second and fourth calendar quarters will generally produce the highest revenues for the year  with the exception of certain of our stations  such as those in myrtle beach  south carolina  where the stations generally earn higher revenues in the second and third quarters of the year because of the higher seasonal population in those communities 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
our most significant station operating expenses are employee salaries and commissions  programming expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures  technical expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
we strive to control these expenses by working closely with local market management 
the performance of radio station groups  such as ours  is customarily measured by the ability to generate station operating income

impairment charge 
sfas no 
requires us to review the recorded values of our fcc broadcast licenses and goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
we completed our annual evaluation during the fourth quarter of and recorded an impairment charge of million in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
the fair market values of our broadcast licenses and reporting units were determined primarily by using a discounted cash flows approach 
we also utilized a market comparable approach  which included evaluating comparable business sales in the industry  in order to validate our results 
several factors and variables contributed to the decrease in the fair market value of certain of our intangible assets  including a reduction in management s projected future cash flows and long term revenue growth rates utilized in its discounted cash flows approach and overall compression in acquisition multiples associated with comparable sales in the industry

seasonality we expect that our operations and revenues will be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have an effect on the timing of our cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources our principal need for funds has been to fund the acquisition of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  repurchases of our outstanding notes and series a preferred stock  repurchases of our class a common stock  and interest and debt service payments 
the following table summarizes our historical funding needs for the years ended december   and acquisitions and purchase of intangible assets capital expenditures notes repurchases preferred stock repurchases repurchases of common stock repayments of bank borrowings interest payments in the short term  our principal future need for funds will include the funding of station operating expenses  corporate general and administrative expenses  lma fees and interest and debt service payments 
in addition  in the long term  our funding needs will include our pending acquisitions million as of december  and capital expenditures associated with maintaining our station and corporate operations and implementing hd radio tm technology 
we expect maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately million for in december  we purchased perpetual licenses from ibiquity  which will enable us to convert to and utilize ibiquity s hd radio tmtechnology on of our stations 
under the terms of the agreement with ibiquity  we will convert certain of our stations over a seven year period 
we anticipate that the average cost to convert each station will be between  and  during  we converted stations for approximately million 
for  we plan to convert an additional stations 
our principal sources of funds for these requirements have been cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities  such as the proceeds from offerings of our securities and borrowings under credit facilities 
we believe that our presently projected cash flow from operations and present financing arrangements  including availability under our existing credit facilities  or borrowings that would be available from future financing arrangements  will be sufficient to meet our future capital needs  including the funding of pending acquisitions  operations and debt service for the next twelve months 
however  our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  
table of contents demographics or audience tastes  and borrowings under financing arrangements are subject to financial covenants that can restrict our financial flexibility 
further  our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing is also subject to market conditions and operating performance 
as such  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing at terms  and on the timetable  that may be necessary to meet our future capital needs 
see item ia risk factors 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately for the year ended december  excluding non cash items  we generated comparable levels of operating income for as compared with the prior year 
as a result  the marginal increase in cash flows from operations was primarily attributable to the timing of certain payments 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities increased million  to million  from million for the year ended december  for fiscal  we invested approximately million in station acquisitions and the purchase of certain broadcast licenses in its houston  texas market 
for  we funded approximately million of our million of acquisitions with shares of our class a common stock  which contributed to an overall decrease in cash outlays as compared with and years prior to cash flows from financing activities 
net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of million paid to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock  offset by net borrowings under our credit facilities of utilized to fund acquisitions and the share repurchases 
net cash used in financing activities in the prior year was primarily the result of the repayment of a million note originally issued in connection with the acquisition of stations in kansas city  missouri in and million paid to repurchase  shares of our class a common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of net borrowings under our credit facilities million  offset by cash paid to repurchase  shares of our series a preferred stock million and cash paid to repurchase million in aggregate principal of the notes million 
historical acquisitions and dispositions 
we completed three acquisitions of ten radio stations in four markets and the acquisition of a studio facility during the year ended december  of the million required to fund these acquisitions  million was funded in cash and million represented capitalizable external acquisition costs 
on march   we completed the acquisition of kfru am  kbxr fm  koql fm and kpla fm serving columbia  missouri and klik am  kbbm fm and kjmo fm serving jefferson city  missouri from premier radio group 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid million in cash and incurred million in capitalizable acquisition costs 
the columbia  missouri and jefferson city  missouri stations were acquired primarily because they complemented our station portfolio and increased both our state and regional coverage 

table of contents on march   we purchased the broadcast license for kvst fm  licensed to laporte  texas and serving houston  texas  for million 
of the million required to purchase the broadcast license  million was funded in cash  million had been previously funded in the form of a cash escrow deposit and million was paid in capitalizable acquisition costs 
during the second quarter of  we completed the construction of a broadcast tower and transmitter site for this station and commenced broadcasting and operation 
the addition of kvst fm represents our second fm station in the houston market 
in august  we completed the disposition of one station in the blacksburg  virginia market for approximately million in cash 
of the total consideration  we received million at closing and million was held in escrow and will be released upon resolution of post closing matters 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a million gain on sale of assets 
pending acquisitions 
as of december   we were a party to various agreements to acquire three stations across two markets 
the aggregate purchase price of those pending acquisitions is expected to be approximately million in cash 
as of december   we were also a party to two asset exchange agreements  under which we have agreed to transfer two of our stations in the ft 
walton beach  florida market plus million in cash in exchange for two different stations in the market 
as of december   we have put million in escrow funds toward these asset exchange transactions 
periodically  the fcc makes fm frequencies available for acquisition through an auction process 
on november   the fcc held an auction for approximately frequencies 
as of the close of the auction  we were the winning bidder for seven frequencies and were obligated to pay the fcc million 
during  the fcc granted the final authorization on and we completed the purchase of six of the seven frequencies won in the november auction 
as of december   we had funded million of our total obligation 
we expect to complete the purchase of the remaining frequency from the november auction during the first half of on january   the fcc held a similar auction for approximately frequencies  located mostly in remote areas of the country  in which we actively participated 
as of the close of the auction  we were the winning bidder for one frequency and were obligated to pay the fcc million 
as of december   we had funded toward our obligation to the fcc in the form of an escrow deposit  to be applied by the fcc to the bid price upon grant of the final authorization for the frequency 
this authorization will enable us to add a station to one of our existing markets once constructed 
we expect to consummate our remaining pending acquisitions during  although there can be no assurance that the transactions will be consummated within that time frame  or at all 
in addition  from time to time we complete acquisitions following the initial grant of an assignment application by the fcc staff  but before such grant becomes a final order  and a petition to review such a grant may be filed in the interim 
there can be no assurance that such grants may not ultimately be reversed by the fcc or an appellate court as a result of such petitions  which could result in a requirement that we divest the assets we have acquired 
our ability to make future acquisitions in addition to the pending acquisitions is dependent on our ability to obtain additional equity and or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing 
sources of liquidity 
we have historically financed our acquisitions primarily through the proceeds from debt and equity financings  the proceeds from asset divestitures and using cash generated from operations 
we financed the cash components of our acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations 
on july   we entered into a new million credit facility  which provides for a seven year million revolving credit facility and a seven year million term loan facility 
we used the proceeds of the term loan facility  fully funded on july   and drawings on that date of million on the revolving credit facility  primarily to repay all amounts owed under our prior credit facility 
through december   we drew down million under our revolving facility and made 
table of contents payments of million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the seven year revolving credit facility and million was outstanding under the seven year term loan facility 
our obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets in which a security interest may lawfully be granted including fcc licenses held by our subsidiaries  including  without limitation  intellectual property  real property  and all of the capital stock of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries except the capital stock of bsi and of the capital stock of any first tier foreign subsidiary 
the obligations under the credit facility are also guaranteed by each of the direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries  except bsi  and are required to be guaranteed by any additional subsidiaries that we acquire 
the term loan facility will mature on july  and will amortize in equal quarterly installments beginning on march   in quarterly amounts as follows for each quarter in and   for each quarter in and   and  for each quarter beginning on march  and through july   
the revolving credit facility will also mature on july  and the commitment will remain unchanged up to that date 
both the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to the alternate base rate as defined under the terms of our credit agreement  as of december  plus a margin ranging between to  or the adjusted libo rate as defined under the terms of the credit agreement  as of december  plus a margin ranging between to in each case dependent upon our leverage ratio 
at december  our effective interest rate  excluding the interest rate swap agreement discussed below  on loan amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
as a result  and including the fixed component of the swap  at december   our effective interest rate on loan amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 
in may  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement that will become effective in march  following the termination of our current swap agreement 
when effective  this swap agreement will effectively fix the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our floating rate bank borrowings through march a commitment fee calculated at a rate ranging from to per year depending upon our leverage levels of the average daily amount available under the revolving credit facility is payable quarterly in arrears  and fees in respect of letters of credit  issued in accordance with the credit agreement governing our credit facility  equal to the interest rate margin then applicable to eurodollar rate loans under the revolving credit facility  are payable quarterly in arrears 
in addition  a fronting fee of is payable quarterly to the issuing bank 
we are required to make certain mandatory prepayments of the term loan facility and there will be automatic reductions in the availability of the revolving credit facility under certain circumstances  including the incurrence of certain indebtedness and upon consummation of certain asset sales 
in these instances  we are required to apply of the net proceeds to the outstanding balance on the credit facility 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we are subject to certain restrictive financial and operating covenants  including  but not limited to maximum leverage covenants  minimum interest coverage covenants  limitations on capital expenditures  asset dispositions and the payment of dividends 
the failure to comply with the covenants would result in an event of default  which in turn would permit acceleration of debt under the credit agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience and trends 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed and evaluated on a pooled basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
although our management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that the carrying value of our goodwill and certain intangible assets be reviewed at least annually for impairment and charged to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair market value 
for and  we reviewed the fair market values of our broadcast licenses and goodwill and determined that their fair value exceeded their carrying amount and  as such  did not record an impairment charge 
during  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million in order to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair market values 
as of december   we have billion in intangible assets and goodwill  which represent approximately of our total assets 
the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and reporting units  for purposes of our annual impairment tests  was derived primarily by using a discounted cash flows approach 
the fair market values derived include assumptions that contain a variety of variables 
these variables are based on industry data  historical experience and estimates of future performance and include  but are not limited to  revenue and expense growth rates for each radio market  revenue and expense growth rates for our stations in each market  overall discount rates based on our weighted average cost of capital and acquisition multiples 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair market value of goodwill are based on currently available data and our management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a significant effect on the estimated value 
a significant future decrease in the fair market value of broadcast licenses or goodwill in a market could result in additional impairment charges 
in connection with the elimination of amortization of broadcast licenses upon the adoption of sfas no 
 the reversal of our deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets is no longer assured within our net operating loss carry forward period 
as a result  we have recorded deferred tax expense of million  million and million to establish a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry forwards generated during the year ended december   and  respectively  resulting from amortization of goodwill and broadcast licenses that is deductible for tax purposes  but is no longer amortized in the financial statements 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments on october  we announced that  together with affiliates of three private equity firms  we formed cmp  which has entered into agreements to acquire the radio broadcasting business of susquehanna 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first half of and is subject to regulatory 
table of contents approvals  as well as other closing conditions 
pursuant to a capital contribution agreement  we will contribute our kansas city  missouri and houston  texas radio operations and assets to cmp  in exchange for an equity stake initially valued at approximately of the equity of cmp

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
was effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on its effective date did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 which the company adopted on january  sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the first annual reporting period beginning after december  the company has adopted sfas no 
r on a modified prospective method  effective january  as permitted by sfas no 
r  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption

sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior periods financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and corrections of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas no

on march   the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies when an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by this interpretation are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin  which also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  was effective for the year ended december  our adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents intangibles as of december   approximately of our total assets consisted of intangible assets  such as radio broadcast licenses and goodwill  the value of which depends significantly upon the operational results of our business 
we could not operate the radio stations without the related fcc license for each station 
fcc licenses are renewed every eight years  consequently  we continually monitor the activities of our stations to ensure they comply with all regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our licenses have been renewed at the end of their respective eight year periods  and we expect that all licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at december   of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our current floating rate bank borrowings for a three year period 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
segregating the million of borrowings outstanding at december  which are not subject to the interest rate swap and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate swap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 
further  such analysis would not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk as a result of the acquisition of caribbean communications company ltd  ccc  we have operations in five countries throughout the english speaking caribbean 
all foreign operations are measured in their local currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
we maintain no derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and or transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
our foreign operations generated net income of approximately million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to the eastern caribbean dollar or the trinidad and tobago dollar would change net income for the year ended december  by an amount less than million
