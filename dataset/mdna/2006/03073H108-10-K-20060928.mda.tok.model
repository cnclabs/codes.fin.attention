item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements 
the results described below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in any future period 
certain statements in this discussion and analysis  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance  and revenue sources  are forward looking statements based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements  including those described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management uses judgment in selecting policies and procedures and making estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates that the company makes include valuation of loans and equity investments  evaluation of the recoverability of various receivables and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to collect receivables and recover the value of its loans depends on a number of factors  including the financial condition of the debtors and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary 
although the company believes that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at june  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements 
our key critical accounting policies are those applicable to the valuation of loans receivable and other investments including medallions  and contingencies from daily operations  as discussed below valuation of loans receivable 
for loans receivable  fair value generally approximates cost less unrealized depreciation 
overall financial condition of the borrower  the adequacy of the collateral supporting the loans  individual credit risks  historical loss experience and other factors are criteria considered in quantifying the unrealized depreciation  if any  that might exist at the valuation date 
equity securities 
the fair value of publicly traded corporate equity securities is based on quoted market prices 
privately held corporate equity securities are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
for these non quoted investments  the company reviews the financial performance of the privately held companies in which the investments are maintained 
if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary  the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value 
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans 
assets acquired in satisfaction of loans are carried at the lower of the net value of the related foreclosed loan or the estimated fair value less cost of disposal 
losses incurred at the time of foreclosure are charged to the unrealized depreciation on loans receivable 
subsequent reductions in estimated net realizable value are charged to operations as losses on assets acquired in satisfaction of loans 
medallions 
the company obtained medallions through foreclosure of loans and the value of such medallions are carried at the lower of the net value of the related foreclosed loans or the fair market value of the medallions 
the medallions are being treated as having indefinite lives  therefore  the assets are not being amortized 
however  the company periodically tests their carrying value for impairment 
contingencies 
the company is subject to legal proceedings in the course of its daily operations from enforcement of its rights in disputes pursuant to the terms of various contractual arrangements 
in this connection  the company assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters as well as a potential range of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserve required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
general ameritrans acquired elk on december  elk is an sbic that has been operating since  making loans to and  to a limited extent  investments in small businesses  primarily businesses that are majority owned by persons who qualify under sba regulations as socially or economically disadvantaged 
most of elk s business has consisted of originating and servicing loans collateralized by new york city  boston  chicago and miami taxi medallions  but elk also makes loans to and investments in other diversified businesses and to persons who qualify under sba regulations as non disadvantaged 
historically  elk s earnings derived primarily from net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets consisting of business loans  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities consisting of indebtedness to elk s banks and subordinated debentures issued to the sba 
net interest income is a function of the net interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  as well as the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to interest bearing liabilities 
unrealized depreciation on loans and investments is recorded when elk adjusts the value of a loan to reflect management s estimate of the fair value  as approved by the board of directors 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income decreased  or to  as compared with the prior year ended june  the decrease is primarily due to the fact that a significant net gain on sale of securities of  was reported in the prior year  as well as decreases in interest income of  other fees of  and in leasing income of  which is generated by the leasing activities of elk s subsidiaries 
the decrease in interest income is primarily the result of a decrease of  in the net loan portfolio at june  as compared to june   due to payoffs and settlements of loans receivable in excess of new loan fundings and due to the impact of lower average rates charged on new or modified loans 
the decrease in leasing income was primarily due to sales of medallions and autos that were previously leased 
operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  increased  or to  when compared to the year ended june  this reflects the impact of higher interest charged on outstanding bank borrowing 
the company anticipates a reduction in interest expense for fiscal due to a decrease in its short term bank borrowings of  for the fiscal year ended june  this was achieved as a result of temporarily using a majority of the proceeds from a stock offering of ameritrans during fiscal salaries and employee benefits increased  or when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the increases that were put in effect from the recently amended officers employment agreements 
occupancy costs increased  or  when compared with the year ended june  due to increased overhead expenses 
professional fees decreased  or when compared with the prior year 
this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in legal fees incurred relating to the foreclosures of the chicago medallion loans 
miscellaneous administrative expenses decreased  or when compared with the prior year 
loss and impairments on both medallions under lease and assets acquired decreased by  due to fewer write downs of related assets 
foreclosure expenses decreased  or and write off and depreciation of interest and loans receivable decreased  or when compared with the year prior  due to improved performance of the chicago medallion loans 
total write off and depreciation on interest and loans receivable was  net of a decrease in unrealized depreciation of interest of  offset by an increase of unrealized depreciation on loans receivable of net income loss net income decreased from net income of  for the year ended june  to a net loss of  for the year ended june  the decrease in net income for the year ended june  was attributable primarily to a decrease in total investment income of  when compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to a net gain on the sale of securities of  that was recognized in fiscal year  whereas fiscal year includes a loss of  due to write downs on certain equity securities 
results of operations for the years ended june  and total investment income the company s investment income increased  or to  as compared with the prior year ended june  this increase is the result of an increase in the net gain on the sale of securities of  as well as increases in other fees of  and leasing income of  generated by the leasing activities of elk s subsidiaries  offset by a decrease in interest income of  due to the impact of lower average interest rates charged on new and modified loans 
operating expenses interest expense for the year ended june  increased  or to  when compared to the year ended june  this reflects the impact of higher interest charged on outstanding bank borrowing as well as higher outstanding bank notes payable when compared with the prior year 
salaries and employee benefits increased  or when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the increases that were put in effect from the recently amended officers employment agreements 
occupancy costs decreased  or  when compared with the year ended june  due to the first full year under the amended sublease and shared office expense terms 
professional fees increased  or when compared with the prior year 
this increase reflects the additional legal fees incurred relating to the foreclosures of the chicago medallion loans as well as fees related to significant new loans issued 
miscellaneous administrative expenses decreased  or when compared with the prior year 
loss and impairments on both medallions under lease and assets acquired increased by  due to additional write downs of related assets to estimated fair value 
foreclosure expenses decreased  or and write off and depreciation of interest and loans receivable decreased  or when compared with the year prior 
total write off and depreciation on interest and loans receivable was  net of a increase in unrealized depreciation of interest of  offset by an decrease of unrealized depreciation on loans receivable of  the foreclosure expenses incurred by the company as it satisfies outstanding balances incurred by the default borrowers on the medallions with the city of chicago were  for the year ended june  this expense primarily consisted of back taxes  interest and penalties owed to the city of chicago department of revenue by defaulted medallion owners which were required to be paid as a condition of completing the medallion foreclosures sales and transfer to new purchasers  as well as professional fees related to these foreclosures 
net income loss net income increased from a loss of  for the year ended june  as compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the increase in the net income for the year ended june  was attributable primarily to the net gain on the sale of securities of  dividends of participating preferred stock for each of the years ended june  and amounted to  respectively 
balance sheet and reserves total assets decreased by  as of june  when compared to total assets as of june  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the outstanding loans receivable of  which is attributable to payoffs and settlements on loans in excess of new loan fundings during the fiscal year 
there were also decreases in medallions and autos that were sold during the fiscal year for proceeds of  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in investments in equity securities of  in addition  elk s proceeds from banks for the fiscal year were  versus  in repayments made on notes payable from banks 
this resulted in a decrease of  in its short term bank borrowings for the fiscal year ended june  the company used a majority of the proceeds from a stock offering of ameritrans during fiscal to temporarily reduce elk s outstand ing bank debt 
asset liability management interest rate sensitivity ameritrans  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent its interest earning assets consisting of medallion loans and commercial loans rise or fall at a different rate over time in comparison to its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of its credit facilities with banks and subordinated sba debentures 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from ameritrans interest rate sensitivity gap  ie the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
ameritrans interest rate sensitive assets were approximately million and interest rate sensitive liabilities were approximately million at june  having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on the average than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivi ties of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  ameritrans anticipates that approximately of the portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
ameritrans believes that the average life of its loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
interest rate swap agreements ameritrans manages the exposure of its portfolio to increases in market interest rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its variable rate debt against increases in interest rates and by incurring fixed rate debt consisting primarily of subordinated sba debentures 
on february   elk purchased an interest rate swap contract for  with a bank which expired february  the swap transaction provided for a fixed rate of 
effective october   elk entered into two interest rate swap transactions for  each with citibank  na which expire on october   and october   respectively 
these swap transactions were entered into to protect the company from an upward movement in interest rates relating to outstanding bank debt 
these swap transactions provide for a fixed rate of and  respectively 
ameritrans believes that its bank credit facilities and cash flow from operations after distributions to stockholders will be adequate to fund the continuing operations of the company s loan portfolio 
nevertheless  the company continues to explore additional options  which may increase available funds for its growth and expansion strategy 
in addition to the application for sba funding described above  these financing options would provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth 
investment considerations the company is affected by the steady increases in the prime rate of interest due to the federal reserve increase in interest rates which cause a corresponding increase in interest rates by the banks 
during the past sixteen months ended september   interest rates have increased by approximately or basis points 
the dollar amount of the company s adjustable rate loans receivable is approximately  with the remainder being fixed rate loans 
interest rate increases may adversely affect the interest rate spread we receive on our taxicab medallion and commercial loans 
because we borrow money to finance the origination of loans  our income is dependent upon the differences between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan funds 
while the loans in our portfolio in most cases bear interest at fixed rates or adjustable rates  we finance a substantial portion of such loans by incurring indebtedness with floating interest rates 
as short term interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates may lead to more loan prepayments  which could adversely affect our business 
a borrower is likely to exercise prepa yment rights at a time when the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
in a lower interest rate environment  we will have difficulty re lending prepaid funds at comparable rates  which may reduce the net interest spread we receive 
our commercial loan activity has increased in recent years 
lending to small businesses involves a high degree of business and financial risk  which can result in substantial losses and should be considered speculative 
our borrower base consists primarily of small business owners that have limited resources and that are generally unable to obtain financing from banks or other primary sources 
there is generally no publicly available information about these small business owners  and we must rely on the diligence of our employees and agents to obtain information in connection with our credit decisions 
in addition  these small businesses often do not have audited financial statements 
some smaller businesses have narrower product lines and market shares than their competition 
therefore  they may be more vulnerable to customer preferences  market conditions  or economic downturns  which may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  ou r investment in these businesses 
liquidity and capital resources the company has funded its operations through private and public placements of its securities  bank financing  the issuance to the sba of its subordinated debentures and internally generated funds 
on april   ameritrans completed a public offering of  units  consisting of one share of common stock  one share of cumulative participating redeemable preferred stock  face value  and one redeemable warrant exercisable into one share of common stock 
the gross proceeds from the sale were  less offering expenses of approximately  a portion of the proceeds was used temporarily to reduce banks and sba indebtedness 
ameritrans also used part of the proceeds to start its own loan portfolio 
on march   the company closed on the sale of  shares the shares of common stock and  warrants to purchase shares of common stock private offering warrants for aggregate gross proceeds totaling   net of expenses 
the company granted a total of  private offering warrants 
each private offering warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the private offering warrants may be exercised in whole or in part  and expire five years from the date of issuance 
these shares and private offering warrants were issued pursuant to the private offering by the company dated july  of which various closings took place throughout december  january  february and march of the increased capital that was raised for ameritrans will help the company significantly in its plans for the expansion of the company s business  enabling ameritrans to make loans to and investments in opportunities that the company s operating subsidiary  elk has historically been unable to make due to sba regulation 
on march   ameritrans filed a registration statement the march registration statement with the sec to cover the  shares of common stock and  shares of common stock underlying the private offering warrants sold in the private offering 
the march registration statement did not cover any authorized but unissued shares of the company s common stock or participating preferred stock 
the march registration statement was declared effective by the sec on april  at june   or  of elk s indebtedness was represented by indebtedness to its banks with interest rates ranging from to  and or  by the debentures issued to the sba with fixed rates of interest plus user fees which results in rates ranging from to 
elk currently may borrow up to  under its existing lines of credit with the banks  subject to the limitations imposed by its borrowing base agreement with its banks and the sba  the statutory and regulatory limitations imposed by the sba and the availability of funds 
contractual obligations expire or mature at various dates through march  the following table shows all contractual obligations at june  payments due by period less than year years years years years more than years total floating rate borrowings fixed rate borrowings operating lease obligations including overhead total our sources of liquidity are credit lines with banks  long term sba debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayment 
as a ric  we distribute at least of our investment company taxable income 
consequently  we primarily rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
loan amortization and prepayments also provide a source of funding for elk 
prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
like elk  ameritrans will distribute at least of its investment company taxable income and  accordingly  we will continue to rely upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
in order to provide the funds necessary for our expansion strategy  we expect to raise additional capital and to incur  from time to time  additional bank indebtedness and if deemed necessary by management to obtain sba loans 
there can be no assurances that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms 
new accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement requires that all separately recognized servicing rights be initially measured at fair value 
subsequently  an entity may either recognize its servicing rights at fair value or amortize its servicing rights over an estimated life and assess for impairment at least quarterly 
sfas no 
also amends how gains and losses are computed in transfers or securitizations that qualify for sale treatment in which the transferor retains the right to service the transferred financial assets 
additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing rights are also required 
this statement is effective january  for calendar year companies 
the company is currently in the process of evaluating the i mpact that sfas no 
will have on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of sfas no 
and this statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 
 establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are free standing derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that require bifurcation  clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and amends sfas no 
to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september   as defined 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   but does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of the stateme nt 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on results of operations or the company s financial position 
in december  the fasb issued the sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which replaced sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and superseded apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the date of grant 
the company previously used the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards 
on april   the sec amended the compliance dates for sfas r  which extended the company s required adoption date of sfas r to its fiscal third quarter in its fiscal year ended june  the company adopted the requirements of sfas r on a modified prospective basis effective january  and expects that its adoption will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations and earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s business activities contain elements of risk 
the company considers the principal types of risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio valuations 
the company considers the management of risk essential to conducting its businesses 
accordingly  the company s risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze the company s risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
the company values its portfolio at fair value as determined in good faith by the company s board of directors in accordance with the company s valuation policy 
unlike certain lending institutions  the company is not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the company must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
the company records unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when it believes that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of the company s portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
the company adjusts the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect the board of directors estimate of the current fair value of each component of the portfolio 
any changes in estimate d fair value are recorded in the company s statement of operations as net unrealized depreciation on investments 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
also  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation might be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we loan and invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
as interest rates rise  our interest costs increase  decreasing the net interest rate spread we receive and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
although we intend to continue to manage our interest rate risk through asset and liability management  including the use of interest rate swaps  general rises in interest rates will tend to reduce our interest rate spread in the short term 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have resulted in an additional net loss of approximately  at june  this is comprised of a change in two components  loans receivable of approximately  at variable interest rate terms  and approximately  for bank debt subject to variable market rates 
this example does not take into account the impact of the interest rate swaps the company has in place on its bank debt to mitigate the effects of increases in variable interest rates 
no assurances can be given however  that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates
