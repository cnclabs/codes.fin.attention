dd s discounts features a more moderately priced assortment of first quality  in season  name brand apparel  accessories  footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of to off moderate department and discount store regular prices 
our primary strategy is to pursue and refine our existing off price business  and steadily expand our store base 
in establishing growth objectives for our business  we closely monitor market share trends for the off price industry 
sales for the off price sector grew by during  which is significantly faster than total national apparel sales  which grew by  according to data from the npd group  which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry 
this reflects the ongoing importance of value to consumers 
our strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts 
we refer to our fiscal years ended january   january   and january  as  and  respectively 
results of operations sales sales millions sales growth comparable store sales growth decline costs and expenses as a percent of sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative impairment of long lived assets interest income expense earnings before taxes as a percent of sales net earnings as a percent of sales stores 
total stores open at the end of  and were  and  respectively 
the number of stores at the end of  and increased by  and from the respective prior fiscal years 
our operating strategy is to open additional stores based on local market penetration  the ability to leverage overhead expenses  local demographic characteristics including population  and competition 
we continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations 
we also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria 
stores at the beginning of the period stores opened in the period stores closed in the period stores at the end of the period selling square footage at the end of the period sales 
sales for increased million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of net new stores during  the impact of the stores opened in  and a increase in sales from comparable stores defined as stores that have been open for more than complete months

our sales mix is shown below for  and ladies home accents and bed and bath men s fine jewelry  accessories  lingerie and fragrances children s shoes total we expect to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods off price retailers by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization  to diversify the merchandise mix  and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional and local merchandise offerings 
although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in  and  we can not be sure that they will result in a continuation of revenue or profit growth 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in increased million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of net new stores during the year  the impact of the stores opened in  and increased distribution and logistics costs 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for increased approximately basis points compared with the same period in the prior year 
this increase was driven by a basis point decrease in merchandise gross margin  mainly due to higher shortage costs 
in addition  higher freight costs drove a basis point increase in distribution and logistics costs as a percent of sales 
these increases in total cost of goods sold were partially offset by about a basis point decrease in store occupancy costs and a basis point decrease in buying expenses  due to leverage from the increase in comparable store sales during the year 
cost of goods sold in increased million compared to the same period in the prior year  mainly due to increased sales from the opening of net new stores during the year  the impact of the stores opened in  higher markdowns and increased distribution and logistics costs 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for increased approximately basis points compared to due to higher distribution and logistics costs  lower merchandise gross margin largely due to higher markdowns and reduced leverage resulting from the decrease in comparable store sales which contributed to higher occupancy and buying expenses as a percentage of sales  and buying costs related to the launch of dd s discounts 
we can not be sure that the gross profit margins realized in  and will continue in future years 
for fiscal and future years  we expect some decrease in our gross profit margins as a result of increases in our cost of goods sold to reflect a portion of the additional stock based compensation expenses we will recognize under sfas no 
r share based payment 
see the further discussion of sfas no 
r  and our expectation regarding the amount of the additional costs  under new accounting pronouncements 
also refer to the discussion under stock based compensation in note a to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our historical  pro forma equity compensation cost calculation 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million compared to the prior year  mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of net new stores during the period  in addition to higher incentive plan costs 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately basis points compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to an approximate basis point increase relating to higher incentive plan costs and about basis points due to increased information technology costs and related depreciation 
these higher costs were partially offset by a basis point decrease in store operating and advertising costs and a basis point decrease in other general and administrative expenses  which both benefited from leverage on the increase in comparable store sales 
for  sg a increased million compared to the prior year  mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of net new stores during the period  partially offset by lower incentive plan costs 
sg a as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately basis points  primarily due to an approximate basis point decrease in incentive plan costs partially offset by a basis point increase in store payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales 
the largest component of sg a is payroll 
the total number of employees  including both full and part time  at january   january  and january  was approximately   and  respectively 
for fiscal and future years  we expect some increase in our sg a to reflect a portion of the additional stock based compensation expenses we will recognize under sfas no

during the third quarter of  we sold the newark facility for net proceeds of approximately million 
we recognized a gain reduction in impairment loss of approximately million in the third quarter of on this sale 
for the net impairment charge recognized was approximately million 
taxes on earnings 
our effective tax rate for  and was approximately  which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit realized for state income taxes 
the effective rate is impacted by changes in law  location of new stores  level of earnings and the result of tax audits 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will be approximately to 
net earnings 
net earnings as a percentage of sales remained flat in compared to primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by the absence of an impairment charge and increased interest income as a percentage of sales 
net earnings as a percentage of sales decreased in compared to primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
diluted earnings per share in was  compared to in  inclusive of the 
impairment charge related to the newark facility and 
related to lease accounting adjustments attributable to the prior year 
this increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate increase in net earnings and a reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding

critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
we purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory 
packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date  which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year 
included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shrinkage 
the shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts 
if actual market conditions  markdowns  or shrinkage are less favorable than those projected by us  or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated  additional merchandise inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets 
we record a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
an impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group 
if our actual results differ materially from projected results  an impairment charge may be required in the future 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of million before taxes to write down the carrying value and account for the sale of our newark facility 
in the course of performing our annual analysis  we determined that no other long lived asset impairment charge was required for the years ended january   january  and january  depreciation and amortization expense 
property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and to years for real property 
the cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term  whichever is less 
lease accounting 
we currently capitalize rent during a construction build out period and amortize it over the lease term commencing when the leased premises are substantially ready for their intended use 
we will adopt fasb staff position fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed  not capitalized  beginning in when a lease contains rent holidays or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments  we record rental expense on a straight line basis and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent 
we amortize deferred rent on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date the leased space is ready for its intended use 
tenant improvement allowances are included in other long term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term 
changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
self insurance 
we self insure certain of our workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of our health plans 
our self insurance liability is determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required 
the list above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under item in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will implement the requirements of the standard as of the beginning of our fiscal year we will use the modified prospective approach for adoption of sfas no 
r 
under this approach  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r will apply to new awards granted in our fiscal year and later and to awards that are outstanding from prior fiscal years if they are subsequently modified or canceled 
these awards will be valued using the black scholes option pricing model  consistent with our prior pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
compensation expense for awards outstanding at the beginning of our fiscal year will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for the previously reported pro forma disclosure purposes 
for awards granted after the beginning of our fiscal year  we will recognize expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting term 
we do not believe that the impact from adopting this standard will be materially different from what has been reported in our prior pro forma disclosures  and expect the effect to represent compensation costs equivalent to about 
per share for fiscal see the discussion under stock based compensation in note a to notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our pro forma equity compensation cost calculations for  and the stock based compensation we will recognize after the adoption of sfas no 
r will be affected by the number of stock based awards granted in the future and the assumptions used for estimating the fair values of options 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in an accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
 which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  to clarify the proper accounting for rental costs incurred on building or ground operating leases during a construction period 
the fsp requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed  not capitalized 
the statement is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  we will adopt fsp beginning in our fiscal year and do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position 
forward looking statements our annual report on form k for fiscal  and information we provide in our annual report to stockholders  press releases  telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our website  may contain a number of forward looking statements regarding  without limitation  planned store growth  new markets  expected sales  projected earnings levels  capital expenditures and other matters 
these forward looking statements reflect our then current beliefs  projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance  operations and competitive position 
the words plan  expect  anticipate  estimate  believe  forecast  projected  guidance  looking ahead and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue  profitability  and growth remain difficult to predict 
as a result  our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward looking statements and our previous expectations and projections 
refer to item a in this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion of risk factors for ross and dd s discounts 
the factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change 
as a result  any forecasts or forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time 
we disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which primarily include changes in interest rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices 
we had no outstanding forward contracts at january interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities and term debt is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
in addition  lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and had million of term debt outstanding which accrues interest at libor plus basis points 
in addition  the lease on our distribution center in fort mill  south carolina accrues interest at libor plus basis points 
a hypothetical basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as of and for the year ended january  we do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible  near term changes in interest rates to be material
