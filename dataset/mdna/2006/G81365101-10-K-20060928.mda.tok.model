we sold our last remaining south african operations in november we still have significant assets that are denominated in south african rand 
the assets include cash and notes receivables 
currently we do not have a financial hedging program to protect against the depreciation of the sa rand against the us dollar and  therefore  as long as we hold assets in south africa we will continue to record income statement gains or losses to the extent that the rand s value fluctuates relative to the us dollar

results of operations due to the classification of the results from fantasy sports as discontinued operations and as only two months operating results for strategy first were included in the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may not provide an accurate comparison between the current and past fiscal years 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in revenues in was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal as compared to two months in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales increased million to million in fiscal as compared to 
million in the prior year 
cost of sales relate solely to the operations of strategy first 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal as compared to two months in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses related to corporate overhead were million in fiscal and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of including operations from strategy first for a full year in fiscal as compared to two months in fiscal strategy first s sales  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal when only two months operations were recorded 
included in these amounts are stock based compensation charges of million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal amortization and depreciation amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to the full year amortization of intangible assets related to strategy first in fiscal as compared to two months in fiscal depreciation expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase is related to strategy first s operations being recorded for the full year in foreign currency gains foreign currency gains or losses are almost exclusively related to the assets remaining from the sale of discontinued south african operations 
the foreign currency losses during fiscal were million as compared to gains of million in fiscal these gains or losses are the result of the fluctuations of the south african rand against the us dollar 
during the year ended june   the rand depreciated approximately against the us dollar  while it depreciated approximately in fiscal in  the increase in the market value of our rand put us dollar call option offset the foreign currency losses which resulted in an overall gain for the year 
these foreign currency gains are non cash items until converted into us dollars when any accumulated gains or losses will be converted into cash 
during the year ended june   we received approximately r million south african rand million as final payment of notes and interest owed by salwin pty  ltd 
acquisition costs incurred during the year ended june   we incurred approximately million pursuing the unsuccessful acquisition of and subsequent litigation against a european software company 
we are seeking damages for breach of contract from this european software company 
amortization of convertible debt discounts and issuance costs amortization of convertible debt discounts and issuance costs were million in fiscal there were no charges of this nature in fiscal these expenses relate to the issuance of our million convertible debenture to dkr oasis in october interest income interest income of million was recorded during fiscal as compared to interest income of million in fiscal interest income is primarily earned on cash balances as well as on notes receivable from the sale of our south african businesses 
interest income is  therefore affected by the fluctuation of movements in the us and south african interest rates as well as by the fluctuation of the south african rand against the us dollar 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal was million as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to interest incurred in connection with the issuance of our million convertible debenture to dkr oasis in october provision for income taxes we are registered in bermuda  where no income tax laws are applicable 
two of our subsidiaries are subject to us income taxes  one subsidiary is subject to canadian income taxes and one is subject to south african income taxes 
up to this date  none of them has had taxable income as they have incurred losses for tax purposes 
the deferred tax asset generated by the tax losses and temporary differences has been fully reserved 
in early april  our subsidiary first south african holdings received a letter from the south african revenue service sars challenging certain tax treatment of dividends and operating loss carry forwards for the years through subsequently sars has issued an assessment for approximately million 
we believe that our south african tax filings are in full compliance with all applicable laws and are vigorously defending its position in this regard 
however  until such time as these issues are resolved  we will retain cash in an amount approximately equal to the assessment in south africa to satisfy any potential liability that may arise 
not withstanding the above and after reviewing this potential liability with outside experts and conducting a further review into the circumstances of the assessment  we have recorded an estimated liability of approximately  at this time 
we will continue to vigorously defend our position in this matter 
however  circumstances may dictate that we increase this liability as we proceed 
there is  therefore  no assurance that the  amount will be sufficient to offset the ultimate tax liability 
conversely  we believe that we have strong defenses in this matter and we may ultimately obtain a ruling that results in a lesser liability 
as this is a fluid situation  we will assess our liability in this regard on a quarterly basis and may adjust this  liability in the future 
discontinued operations during fiscal  we recognized gains of million from the discontinued operations of fantasy sports  inc as compared to million in fiscal net income we have recognized a net loss of million during fiscal compared to net income of million during the prior year 
for fiscal year  net loss includes non cash foreign currency losses of approximately million  million accrued for an estimated foreign tax liability  million costs incurred within an abandoned acquisition and million amortization costs related to the issuance of our million convertible debenture 
during fiscal  we recognized million in non cash foreign currency gains and did not incur any expenses in regard to the other categories 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
in fiscal  we recognized two months income from strategy first while we had no income from continued operations in fiscal cost of sales the cost of sales was million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  as compared to million in the prior year 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses related to corporate overhead were million as compared to million in fiscal strategy first s sales  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal as compared to in fiscal amortization and depreciation amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of the acquisition of strategy first in april depreciation expense was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal foreign currency gains foreign currency gains or losses are related to the financial assets remaining in the south african operations 
the foreign currency gains during fiscal were million as compared to gains of million in fiscal these gains are the result of fluctuations of the south african rand against the us dollar 
during the year ended june   the rand depreciated approximately against the us dollar while it appreciated in fiscal these foreign currency gains or losses are non cash items until converted into us dollars  when any accumulated gains or losses will be converted to cash 
interest income interest income of million was recorded during fiscal as compared to interest income of million in the prior year 
interest income is primarily earned on notes receivable from the sale of our south african business and is affected by the fluctuation of the south african rand against the us dollar  as well as movement in south african prime interest rates 
interest expense interest expense during fiscal and was million 
provision for income taxes the company is registered in bermuda  where no income tax laws are applicable 
three of the company s subsidiaries are subject to us income taxes  and one is subject to south african income taxes 
up to this date  none of our us and canadian subsidiaries have had taxable income as they have incurred losses for tax purposes 
the deferred tax asset generated by the tax losses and temporary differences has been fully reserved 
discontinued operations during fiscal  the company recognized gains of million from the discontinued operations of fantasy sports  inc as compared to million in fiscal net income loss the company has recognized net income of million during fiscal compared to net income of million during fiscal included non cash foreign currency gains of approximately million 
during fiscal  the company recognized million in non cash foreign currency gains 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash increased by million from million at june  to million at june  the cash balances are being held for acquisitions and working capital purposes 
we expect this balance to be sufficient to fund our operations and the operations of our subsidiaries for the next twelve months 
included in this amount is million which is classified as restricted cash 
this amount relates to cash used to secure borrowings of our subsidiary  strategy first  as well as money retained in south africa to satisfy any potential liability that may result from our tax dispute with the south african revenue service 
working capital increased by million from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily due to the cash received from the sale of fantasy sports  the repayment of a portion of our notes receivable  and issuance of our million convertible debenture to dkr oasis  net of repayments and costs incurred 
accrued interest earned during the year has been classified as part of the long term notes receivable 
at june   we had borrowings of million  which consisted of million advances against the lines of credit  secured by the company s cash  and term loans of million 
additionally  we have million face amount outstanding in our convertible debenture issued to dkr oasis  net of reppayments or costs incurred 
we currently pay monthly interest on this amount at a rate of prime plus 
should there be no conversions of this debenture  principal payments will start on february  with the loan being amortized monthly through september in the future we expect to meet our short and long term obligations through its cash on hand 
we expect to repatriate our unrestricted funds held in south africa to the united states 
we believe that repatriation of the full amount is allowable under current south african foreign currency regulations 
over the last eight years  we have  from time to time  repatriated funds from south africa without restriction 
however  there can be no guarantee that the south african foreign currency regulations will not change in the future in a manner that might restrict our ability to repatriate the remaining assets 
in the future we intend to add additional operating subsidiaries that will produce revenues and net profits 
we may utilize a portion of the working capital in connection with the acquisition or establishment of those operations 
we may also be required to secure additional debt or equity funding in connection with those future acquisitions 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional indebtedness or raise additional equity to finance future acquisitions on terms acceptable to management 
the following table is a summary of contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations   convertible debt obligations    interest payable    operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    employment contracts     total   future commitments through june   strategy first has sustained an operating loss 
we anticipate that this situation will be remedied through a combination of increased revenues through sustained new game releases as well as a reduction in expenses 
strategy first is projecting an operating profit for the coming twelve months 
there are no assurances that these expectations will be met 
in this event  we may need to continue to support the operations of our subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our operations revenue recognition strategy first distributes the majority of its products through third party software distributors to mass merchant and major retailers and directly to certain pc software retailers  all of which have traditionally sold consumer entertainment pc software products 
additionally  strategy may license its products to distributors in exchange for royalty payments 
the distribution of products is governed by purchase orders  distribution agreements or direct sale agreements  most of which allow for product returns and price markdowns 
for product shipments to these software distributors or retailers  strategy records a provision for product returns and price markdowns as a reduction of gross sales at the time the product passes to these distributors or retailers 
payment terms generally require at delivery  with an additional due at days  days  and days 
revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped by distributors 
the provision for anticipated product returns and price markdowns is primarily based upon strategy first s analysis of historical product return and price markdown results 
should product sell through results at retail store locations fall significantly below anticipated levels this allowance may be insufficient 
strategy first reviews the adequacy of its allowance for product returns and price markdowns and if necessary makes adjustments to this allowance on a quarterly basis 
in the case of royalty income  strategy recognizes revenue when earned based on sales reports from its distributors 
most agreements require quarterly reporting of sales with payment due within days of the end of the quarter 
in many cases  strategy receives guaranteed royalty income and these revenues are recorded upon performance of deliverables per the royalty agreements 
goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
the process of determining goodwill requires judgment 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate 
the company reviews goodwill annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of june  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
while the company believes that no impairment existed as of june   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to an impairment of goodwill 
intangible assets intangible assets include software game titles and non competition agreements 
intangible assets  excluding goodwill  are stated on the basis of cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated lives of three to ten years 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually unless circumstances dictate otherwise 
management periodically reviews intangible assets for impairment based on an assessment of undiscounted future cash flows  which are compared to the carrying value of the intangible assets 
should these cash flows not equal or exceed the carrying value of the intangible  a discounted cash flow model is used to determine the extent of any impairment charge required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not ordinarily hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the company does however recognize market risk from interest rate and foreign currency exchange exposure 
interest rate risk at june   our cash resources earned interest at variable rates 
accordingly  the company s return on these funds is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company also has significant debt that is tied to interest rates and  therefore  any increase in interest rates will have a negative effect on the company s interest payments 
foreign currency risk strategy first  inc is incorporated in canada and sells products throughout the united states and europe 
its functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this has exposed the company to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of the euro  british pound  the canadian dollar  and the us dollar 
certain of the company s cash balances and the remaining proceeds from the sale of its south african subsidiaries are denominated in south african rand 
this has exposed the company to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of the south african rand against the us dollar 
on march   the company acquired a twelve month rand put us dollar call option  at a strike price of r to the us dollar 
during its term  this option served as a partial protection against the depreciation of the sa rand versus the us dollar 
the cost of the option was approximately  and it was closed out in march the company currently does not hedge its south african rand exposure 
at june   we had assets denominated in south african rand of r million million
