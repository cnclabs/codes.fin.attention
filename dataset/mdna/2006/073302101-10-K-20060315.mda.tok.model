item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data overview based on our experience in the industry  we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of cabin interior products for commercial aircraft and business jets and a leading aftermarket distributor of aerospace fasteners 
we sell our products directly to virtually all of the world s major airlines and airframe manufacturers and a wide variety of business jet customers 
in addition  based on our experience  we believe that we have achieved leading global market positions in each of our major product categories  which include seating o commercial aircraft seats  including an extensive line of super first class  first class  business class  tourist class and regional aircraft seats  interior systems o a full line of aircraft food and beverage preparation and storage equipment  including coffeemakers  water boilers  beverage containers  refrigerators  freezers  chillers and a line of ovens which includes microwave  high heat convection and steam ovens  o both chemical and gaseous aircraft oxygen delivery systems  business jet products o business jet and general aviation interior products  including an extensive line of executive aircraft seats  direct and indirect overhead lighting systems  oxygen delivery systems  air valve systems  high end furniture and cabinetry  and aerospace fasteners o a broad line of aerospace fasteners  covering over  skus 
we also design  develop and manufacture a broad range of cabin interior structures and provide comprehensive aircraft cabin interior reconfiguration and passenger to freighter conversion engineering services and component kits 
we generally derive our revenues from refurbishment or upgrade programs for the existing worldwide fleets of commercial and general aviation aircraft and from the sale of our cabin interior equipment for new aircraft deliveries 
for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from the aftermarket  with the remaining portions attributable to the sale of cabin interior equipment associated with new aircraft deliveries 
we believe our large installed base of products  estimated to be approximately billion as of december  valued at replacement prices  gives us a significant advantage over our competitors in obtaining orders both for spare parts and for refurbishment programs  principally due to the tendency of the airlines to purchase equipment for such programs from the incumbent supplier 
we conduct our operations through strategic business units that have been aggregated under three reportable segments the commercial aircraft  distribution and business jet segments 
net sales by line of business were as follows fiscal year ended december  net of net of net of sales net sales sales net sales sales net sales commercial aircraft seating interior systems engineering services  structures and components total commercial aircraft distribution segment business jet segment net sales net sales by domestic and foreign operations were as follows fiscal year ended december  united states operations european operations total net sales by geographic segment based on destination were as follows fiscal year ended december  of net net net of net of sales sales sales net sales sales net sales united states europe asia rest of world total new product development is a strategic initiative for our company 
our customers regularly request that we engage in new product development and enhancement activities 
we believe that these activities protect and enhance our leadership position 
research  development and engineering spending has been approximately of sales for the past several years and is expected to remain at approximately the current spending level for the next year 
we also believe in providing our businesses with the tools required to remain competitive 
in that regard  we have invested in  and will continue to invest in  property and equipment that enhances our productivity 
over the past three years  annual capital expenditures have ranged from approximately taking into consideration our record backlog  targeted capacity utilization levels  recent capital expenditure investments and current industry conditions  we expect that annual capital expenditures will be approximately for the next several years 
international airline competition for profitable international travelers and improving worldwide industry conditions have resulted in increasing demand for our products and services  as demonstrated by record bookings of approximately billion during fiscal which were up  as compared to fiscal at december   backlog was in excess of billion  an increase of over as compared to our december  backlog 
we expect demand to further increase as industry conditions continue to improve over the course of the next several years 
as worldwide air traffic grows and airlines add capacity and upgrade the cabin interiors of existing active aircraft  we expect our aftermarket activities to continue to grow 
according to iata  during the year ended december   the global airline industry expanded airline capacity by approximately in response to an approximately increase in global air traffic 
in addition  as a result of the severity of the post september  downturn  many carriers  particularly in the united states  have deferred interior maintenance and upgrades 
however  we feel that the us carriers will have to upgrade their international fleets to compete on international routes 
we believe there are substantial growth opportunities for retrofit programs  particularly for the twin aisle aircraft that service international routes

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our liquidity requirements consist of working capital needs  ongoing capital expenditures and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness 
our primary requirements for working capital are directly related to the level of our operations 
working capital primarily consists of accounts receivable and inventories  which fluctuate with the sales of our products 
our working capital was as of december   as compared to as of december  the increase in our december  working capital was primarily due to the net proceeds of approximately from our december common stock offering  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our principal amount of senior subordinated notes in january at december   our cash and cash equivalents were  as compared to at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents from december  to december  was primarily due to the net proceeds of approximately from our december common stock offering  the proceeds of which were used to redeem our principal amount of senior subordinated notes in january cash flows at december   our cash and bank credit available under our current bank credit facility was as compared to at december  cash provided by operating activities was for the year ended december  as compared to during the year ended december  the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities during were net earnings of plus non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of  less the net non cash impact from the recognition of our domestic deferred tax asset of the primary use of cash in operating activities during the year ended december  was of related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the primary use of cash in operating activities during the year ended december  was the net loss of and of uses related to changes in our operating assets and liabilities  offset by non cash charges from amortization and depreciation of in january  we redeemed our of senior subordinated notes with the proceeds from our december common stock offering 
the primary use of cash in investing activities during the year ended december  was related to capital expenditures for the implementation of new information system enhancements and plant modernization 
the primary use of cash from investing activities during the year ended december  was related to an acquisition and capital expenditures for the implementation of new information system enhancements and plant modernization 
capital spending our capital expenditures were and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate ongoing annual capital expenditures of approximately for the next several years 
we have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have  in the past  generally funded our capital expenditures from cash from operations and funds available to us under bank credit facilities 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures from cash on hand  from operations and from funds available to us under our current or any future bank credit facility 
between and  we completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
following these acquisitions  we rationalized the businesses  reduced headcount by approximately  employees and eliminated facilities 
we have financed these acquisitions primarily through issuances of debt and equity securities  including our currently outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes and bank credit facilities 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements under our amended and restated bank credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank there are no maintenance financial covenants  other than maintaining an interest coverage ratio as defined in the bank credit facility of at least for the trailing month period 
the bank credit facility expires in february  is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and bears interest at rates ranging from to basis points over the eurodollar rate  as defined in the bank credit facility approximately at december  
at december   indebtedness under the bank credit facility consisted of letters of credit aggregating approximately and the amount available under the bank credit facility was as of december  the credit facility contains customary affirmative covenants  negative covenants and conditions of borrowings  all of which were met as of december  long term debt at december  consisted principally of our senior notes  senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes 
we redeemed our senior subordinated notes in january the of senior notes mature on october   and the of notes mature on may  the senior subordinated notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of our senior indebtedness 
the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are senior to all of our subordinated indebtedness  but subordinate to any secured borrowings under our bank credit facility 
each of the senior subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes contains  and the senior subordinated notes contained  restrictive covenants  including limitations on future indebtedness  restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  liens  dividends  mergers and transfers of assets  all of which we met as of december  a breach of these covenants  or the covenants under our current or any future bank credit facility  that continues beyond any grace period can constitute a default  which can limit the ability to borrow and can give rise to a right of the lenders to terminate the applicable facility and or require immediate repayment of any outstanding debt 
contractual obligations the following charts reflect our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us or our subsidiaries pursuant to a funding commitment 
contractual obligations thereafter total bank credit facility other long term debt operating leases purchase obligations future interest payments on outstanding debt total  commercial commitments letters of credit of senior subordinated notes were redeemed in january occasionally we enter into purchase commitments for production materials and other items  which are reflected in the table above 
we also enter into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation or are undocumented except for an invoice 
such obligations are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services and are not reflected in the total unconditional purchase obligations presented in this line item 
approximately of the interest payments relates to the senior subordinated notes which were redeemed in january we believe that our cash flows  together with cash on hand provide us with the ability to fund our operations  make planned capital expenditures and make scheduled debt service payments for the foreseeable future 
however  such cash flows are dependent upon our future operating performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including the conditions of our markets  some of which are beyond our control 
if  in the future  we cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our debt service obligations  we will need to refinance such debt obligations  obtain additional financing or sell assets 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash from operations  or that we will be able to obtain financing from other sources  sufficient to satisfy our debt service or other requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements lease arrangements we finance our use of certain equipment under committed lease arrangements provided by various financial institutions 
since the terms of these arrangements meet the accounting definition of operating lease arrangements  the aggregate sum of future minimum lease payments is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   future minimum lease payments under these arrangements aggregated approximately indemnities  commitments and guarantees during the normal course of business  we made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these indemnities include non infringement of patents and intellectual property indemnities to our customers in connection with the delivery  design  manufacture and sale of our products  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  and indemnities to other parties to certain acquisition agreements 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
we believe that substantially all of our indemnities  commitments and guarantees provide for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
however  we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of liability related to our indemnities  commitments and guarantees because such liabilities are contingent upon the occurrence of events which are not reasonably determinable 
management believes that any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees would not be material to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
product warranty costs estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time products are sold 
in estimating our future warranty obligations  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims and the cost to replace or repair our products under warranty 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the activity related to our accrued warranty expense fiscal year ended december  balance at beginning of year charges to costs and expenses costs incurred acquisitions balance at end of year deferred tax assets we reversed a significant portion of our previously recorded valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of  resulting in a tax benefit of approximately the deferred tax asset was recorded as a result of our improving financial performance and outlook  as well as the expected reduction in interest expense arising from the redemption of of our senior subordinated notes  which occurred in january we maintained a valuation allowance of as of december  related to our foreign net operating loss carryforward and our domestic capital loss carryforward because of uncertainties that preclude us from determining that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize such assets during the applicable carryforward periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under apb  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas no 
r will be effective for the company beginning on january  we will use the modified prospective application transition method and estimates that the adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material impact on its reported results of operations due to the acceleration of vesting on all outstanding stock options approved by us in december see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin no 
clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and provides further guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
 the adoption of which did not result in any impact to our results of operations or financial position for the year ended december  in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  as well as changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance it does not include specific transition provisions 
specifically  sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the effects of the change  the new accounting principle must be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and a corresponding adjustment must be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of the change  the new principle must be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing pronouncements 
we have evaluated the impact of sfas no 
and we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of operations or financial condition 
we will apply sfas no 
in future periods  when applicable 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of products are recorded when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when the products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  risk of loss and title has passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on the terms of the sales contract 
service revenues primarily consist of engineering activities and are recorded when services are performed 
historically  revenues and costs under certain long term contracts are recognized using contract accounting under the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires the use of estimates of costs to complete long term contracts 
the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of these contracts as well as the technical nature of the products involved 
adjustments to these estimated costs are made on a consistent basis 
a provision for contract losses is recorded when such facts are determinable 
we sell our products primarily to airlines and aircraft manufacturers worldwide  including occasional sales collateralized by letters of credit 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
actual losses have been within management s expectations 
we apply judgment to ensure that the criteria for recognizing sales are consistently applied and achieved for all recognized sales transactions 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  our operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost is determined using the standard cost method for our manufacturing businesses and the weighted average cost method for our distribution businesses 
the inventory balance  which includes the cost of raw material  purchased parts  labor and production overhead costs  is recorded net of a reserve for excess  obsolete or unmarketable inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage and on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
as demonstrated since the events of september   demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventories 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
long lived assets including tangible and intangible assets and goodwill to conduct our global business operations and execute our strategy  we acquire tangible and intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairment to goodwill of a reporting unit and other intangible assets on an annual basis or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  expected changes in the global economy  aerospace industry projections  discount rates and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other acquired tangible or intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us calculating our actual current tax together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as the treatment of accounting reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of foreign net operating loss and domestic capital loss carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we revise these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust the valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates affecting the cost of our variable rate debt 
foreign currency we have direct operations in europe that receive revenues from customers primarily in us dollars and purchase raw materials and component parts from foreign vendors primarily in british pounds or euros 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
the largest foreign currency exposure results from activity in british pounds and euros 
from time to time  we and our foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage risk on transactions conducted in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding forward currency exchange contracts 
in addition  we have not entered into any other derivative financial instruments 
interest rates at december   we had no adjustable rate debt and fixed rate debt of the weighted average interest rate for the fixed rate debt was approximately at december  if interest rates were to increase by above current rates  the impact on our financial statements would be to reduce pretax income by a negligible amount 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we maintained a portfolio of securities consisting mainly of taxable  interest bearing deposits with weighted average maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  we estimate interest income would increase or decrease by approximately
