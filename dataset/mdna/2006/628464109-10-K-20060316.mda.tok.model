table of contents the following summarizes the company s estimated future cash outflows from financial contracts and commitments less than year years years thereafter total dollars in thousands principal payments on debt interest lease payments pension total market risk and derivative financial instruments the company has financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
as such  the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the volatility and impact of rate changes on earnings while maintaining the lowest overall borrowing cost 
at present  the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on any portion of its financing arrangements with floating rates 
accordingly  based on current debt levels at december   if market interest rates increase one percent  the company s interest expense would increase approximately million 
some of the company s subsidiaries operate in foreign countries and  as such  their financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements 
the company believes that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations do not represent a significant market risk due to the nature of the foreign countries in which we operate  primarily canada and western europe  as well as the size of those operations relative to the total company 
the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
as such  the cost of operations is subject to fluctuation as the market for these commodities changes 
the company monitors this risk but currently has no derivative contracts to hedge this risk  however  the company also has no significant purchase obligations to purchase fixed quantities of such commodities in future periods 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported are affected by estimates and judgements that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
while estimates and judgements are applied in arriving at reported amounts such as pension benefits and provisions for self insured risks  we believe the following matters may involve a high degree of judgement and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns  at the point of passage of title  which is at the time of shipment 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company also reviews historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 

table of contents inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for approximately percent of the company s inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  recorded goodwill is subjected to annual impairment testing  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
goodwill impairment testing requires  in part  that we estimate the fair value of our business units which  in turn  requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates for those businesses 
fair values are established using a weighted average of comparative market multiples in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows 
the discount rate used as of december  and december  was and respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of a lowering of the risk free rate in the weighted average cost of capital 
in addition we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our business units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our business units 
our estimate of the fair values of these business units and the related goodwill  could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying business or the impact of future events on the cost of capital and the related discount rates used 
no impairment losses were recorded during the years ended december    or contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than our estimates  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest such earnings for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states and in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates both higher and lower than in the united states 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities and expense to be recognized 
recent pronouncements in november  the fasb issued a sfas no 
 inventory costs 
an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges in all circumstances 
sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r required that public companies recognize expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payment 
we will adopt sfas no 
r beginning january   and intend to use the modified prospective method of adoption 
as permitted sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation expense for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact to our overall financial position 

table of contents the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and diluted net income per share in stock compensation footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
the effect of this statement on the company will be dependent in large part upon future equity based grants  however  based on options previously granted and related vesting schedules the company would recognize approximately  of compensation expense over the next four years 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits to tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow activity  rather than as an operating cash flow activity as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the provisions of fin became effective december   however  the company has determined that the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition
