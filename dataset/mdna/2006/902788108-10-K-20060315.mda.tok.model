table of contents results of operations overview the average loan to deposit ratio of the company s subsidiary banks has been  and is expected to continue be lower than industry average 
the company plans to continue its efforts to further diversify its fee based operations to help reduce the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
this includes asset and treasury management  investment services  deposit service charges and other fee based services 
as some of the company s fee based businesses are the direct result of the market value of its customers investments  the overall health of the equity and financial markets plays an important role in the recognition of fee income  particularly in trust  mutual fund servicing and investment management areas of the company 
to counter this market risk  the company took action in several areas 
in  the company aligned its brokerage and personal wealth management groups to better position itself to serve its customers 
in  the company added actively managed mutual funds and passively managed investments to its asset management offerings 
the company benefited from record net flows of million into the umb scout funds which are managed by a subsidiary of the company during the year  more than twice the million of net flows registered in  and almost ten times the net flows in also  the company s mutual fund servicing business had strong sales from both existing and new customers throughout due to a renewed effort on sales in and during  the company focused on helping customers transition from paper payment options to electronic payment solutions by providing innovative products and services such as paycard and remote deposit capture 
additionally  the company is investing in a significantly upgraded treasury management platform in order to enable enhanced information reporting and transaction initiation via the internet  improve control of service through online self administration  and strengthen system security 
the company has also adopted a wholesale health savings and flexible spending account strategy focusing on healthcare providers and third party administrators 
this strategy resulted in umb achieving several prominent customer wins 
these items did not have a significant impact on earnings  but are enabling the company to position itself with respect to fee based income in future years 
the interest rate environment has a direct impact on the company s net interest income as the company s balance sheet is structured to be both very liquid and short in duration 
this position adversely impacts the company s net interest income in a declining rate environment 
as rates increase  liabilities will typically reprice more quickly than assets which puts pressure on overall net interest income 
however  in an increasing rate environment  this position should  over time  benefit the company 
management believes that once rates stabilize at a higher rate  then net interest income will improve 
item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  discusses in detail the impact of rising and declining rates on net interest income 
on the expense side  management initiated a voluntary separation plan vsp in early for certain individuals to take early retirement 
over associates participated in this plan 
although this plan had a one time cost of approximately million in  ongoing savings are anticipated 
at this time  management does not anticipate offering the vsp in or future years 
a comprehensive board approved incentive plan was also introduced in to encourage associates to focus on profitable activities 
additionally  management implemented a branch rationalization strategy in in which we sold eleven branches  closed five branches and opened four new branches in strategic locations 
this had a favorable impact on income as a result of the net gains from the sales and closures 
along with this strategy  a renewed focus has been placed on the branch distribution network across the company footprint 
this has enabled the company to experience growth outside of its main headquarters in kansas city  mo 
the company is also facing increased competition from other banks in its markets as well as other competitors such as non bank financial institutions  brokers  insurance companies and investment advisory firms 

table of contents the company faces intense local  regional and national competition for retail customers and competes nationally with respect to its trust and asset management business 
this increased competition continues to have the impact of compressing margins and income from the company s fee based businesses 
as this competition is anticipated to continue  management is addressing these competitive concerns through the implementation of new core systems in and including customer relationship management  corporate treasury management  imaging and other network improvements 
earnings summary the company recorded consolidated net income of million for the year ended december  this represents a percent increase over net income for decreased percent compared to basic earnings per share for the year ended december  were per share compared to in and in basic earnings per share for increased percent over per share earnings  which had decreased percent over fully diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   were per share compared to in and in the company s net interest income increased to million in compared to million in and million in the million increase in net interest income in as compared to is primarily a result of a favorable volume variance partially offset by an unfavorable rate variance 
see table on pages and the volume variance was mostly driven by an percent increase in loans and loans held for sale in as compared to although interest rates increased during  the company experienced an unfavorable rate variance in as compared to as its liabilities repriced more quickly than its assets 
the company anticipates that its yields will continue to slowly improve if rates gradually rise or remain stable 
the million decrease in net interest income in as compared to was primarily a result of an unfavorable rate variance caused by margin compression triggered by historically low interest rates 
see table on pages and the company had an increase of million  or percent in noninterest income in as compared to and a million  or percent decrease in compared to the increase in as compared to is primarily a result of increases in trust and securities processing due to increased inflows into the umb scout funds  increases in service charges as a result of a new overdraft program  net gains on the sales and closures of banking facilities and gain on the sale of employee benefit accounts 
the decrease in from was the result of a few reasons 
the company sold its merchant bankcard discount operation in  which processed credit and debit card activity for commercial and retail merchants  and realized a one time gain of million 
decreases in fee based income contributed to the remaining decrease in noninterest income for compared to the most significant decrease in fee based income was related to trust and securities processing which experienced a decrease due to the gain recognized from the sale of the employee benefit accounts in early noninterest expense increased in by million  or percent compared to and decreased in by million  or percent compared to the million increase from was partially attributable to a million charge for the vsp offered by the company in additionally  there were increases in processing fees largely due to an increase in shareholder servicing and other administration fees paid to investment advisors related to the scout funds  bankcard expenses linked to enhanced rebate programs for consumer and commercial card customers  and other expense non operating charge offs and charitable contributions 
these increases were partially offset by personnel related efficiencies and a decrease in marketing and business development expense 
the million decrease in as compared to was primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefit accounts as fully realized from the sale of the employee benefits business as well as other personnel related efficiencies 
this decrease in salaries and benefits was partially offset by increases in occupancy largely due to the refurbishment of the headquarters building in kansas city and the construction of new branches  equipment  legal and consulting and processing fees linked to the company s upgrading of its core operating systems  and marketing expenses the company s creation of its branding strategy as well as product support 

table of contents net interest income net interest income is a significant source of the company s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities 
the volume of interest earning assets and the related funding sources  the overall mix of these assets and liabilities  and the rates paid on each affect net interest income 
table summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for  and net interest margin is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis fte as a percentage of average earning assets 
a critical component of net interest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest free funding sources 
table analyzes net interest rate margin for the three years ended december   and net interest income  average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for the years through are presented in a table following the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to adjust for the tax exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments  which are primarily obligations of state and local governments 
table rate volume analysis in thousands this analysis attributes changes in net interest income either to changes in average balances or to changes in average rates for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the change in net interest income is due jointly to both volume and rate and has been allocated to volume and rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each 
all rates are presented on a tax equivalent basis and give effect to the disallowance of interest expense for federal income tax purposes  related to certain tax free assets 
the loan average balances and rates include nonaccrual loans

table of contents the company experienced an increase in net interest income of million  or percent  for the year compared to this followed a decline of million  or percent  for the year compared to as illustrated in table  the increase is primarily a result of a favorable volume variance due mostly to a million  or percent  increase in average loan balances 
the increase in interest rates also had a corresponding increase in the rate variance for earning assets 
however  the same increase in rates affected liabilities repricing more quickly than asset repricing  causing an overall unfavorable rate variance for as compared to as illustrated in table  the decrease in net interest margin as compared to is mostly due to an unfavorable rate variance 
interest rates hit a low in mid before beginning to increase in the second half of although the duration of the company s portfolio is relatively short  an increase in rates has a more immediate impact on liabilities than it does assets 
on the liability side  a significant portion of the company s funding sources reprice frequently in particular  interest bearing demand and savings and federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
to illustrate the asset side  at the end of  percent of the company s loans are fixed rate loans see table on page and the average maturity of the investment portfolio is months see discussion under securities on page 
management believes that the overall outlook in its net interest income is positive 
the highest yielding assets  loans  have increased from an average of billion at the end of to an average of billion at the end of loan related earning assets tend to have a higher spread than those earned in the company s investment portfolio as  by design  its investment portfolio is very short in duration and liquid in its composition of assets 
if rates continue to increase  the rate impact on both loans and investment yields will be favorable 
given the term of the company s earning assets  a sustained higher rate environment has historically had a positive impact on the company s net interest income and management expects that this will occur in the future 
management is continuing a strategic initiative to emphasize commercial and consumer loan growth through marketing  product enhancements and streamlining the approval process for its consumer loan product suite 
these efforts are designed to increase volumes of new applications and booked loans 
during  approximately million of securities are expected to mature and be reinvested 
management believes that the securities portfolio continues to be an opportunity for both interest income and yield improvement  depending upon rate changes 
in late  management adopted a portfolio modification plan designed to improve interest income by extending the average life of its investment portfolio 
the company intends to continue to implement this extension strategy over the course of the next three to five quarters 
the original plan called for a modest extension of to months to the average portfolio life 
the total investment portfolio had an average life of months and months as december  and december   respectively 
this increase is a result of implementing the extension strategy 
it should be noted that the company has a significant portfolio of extremely short term discount notes as of the end of both and these securities are held due to the seasonal fluctuation related to public fund deposits which are expected to flow out of the bank in a relatively short period 
at december   the amount of such discount notes was approximately million  and without these discount notes  the average life of the core investment portfolio would have been months 
at december   the amount of such discount notes was approximately billion  and without these discount notes  the average life of the core investment portfolio would have been months 
therefore  the core investment portfolio  without the short term discount notes  had an increase in average life of months in continued implementation of this plan is subject to market conditions including the existing yield curve and a sufficient supply of securities with acceptable risk reward characteristics 
the effectiveness of this plan is uncertain as it is dependent upon future market conditions including interest rate changes 
overall  if interest rates continue to rise at a measured pace and given the term and changing mix of the company s balance sheet  management expects net interest income to increase 
management believes the company will obtain additional improvement in net interest income once rates stabilize 

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses all represents management s judgment of the losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust its all to the level considered appropriate by management 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends  a review of individual loans  migration analysis  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
bank regulatory agencies require that the adequacy of the all be maintained on a bank by bank basis for each of the company s subsidiaries 
in  the company partially decentralized its loan approval process by increasing the lending authority limits of its regions 
however  the company maintained its centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  larger loan requests are still centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
management of the company expensed an additional million  or percent  related to the provision for loan losses in as compared to this compares to a million  or decrease in the provision for loan losses in as compared to as illustrated on table below  the all decreased from of total loans as of december  to of total loans as of december  this decrease was due to both a sustained decrease in nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans in  as well as continued low charge offs in  and see table below 
as shown in table  the all has been allocated to various loan portfolio segments 
the company manages the all against the risk in the entire loan portfolio and therefore  the allocation of the all to a particular loan segment may change in the future 
in the opinion of management  the all is appropriate based on the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at december  although no assurance can be given  management of the company believes the present all is adequate considering the company s loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions  and does not anticipate material increases in the all or in the level of provisions to the all in the near future 
future economic conditions and borrowers ability to meet their obligations  however  are uncertainties which could affect the company s all and or need to change its current level of provision

fee based services provide the opportunity to offer multiple products and services to customers and  therefore  more closely align the customer with the company 
the company s ongoing focus is to develop and offer multiple products and services to its customers 
fee based services that have been emphasized include trust and securities processing  securities trading brokerage and cash treasury management 
management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably as most of these are driven off of common platforms and support structures 

table of contents table summary of noninterest income in thousands year ended december trust and securities processing trading and investment banking service charges on deposit accounts insurance fees and commissions brokerage fees bankcard fees gain on sales of assets and deposits  net gain on sale of employee benefit accounts gain on sale of merchant discount operation losses gains on sales of securities available for sale  net other total noninterest income noninterest income summarized in table increased by million  or percent  in as compared to this compares to a decrease in noninterest income of million  or percent in as compared to the increase in noninterest income in as compared to is primarily a result of increases in fee based services including trust and securities processing  service charges on deposits and bankcard fees 
additional increases are a result of significant gains on the sales of assets and deposits  net due to the sale of certain branch locations during and the sale of employee benefit accounts the final earnout payment was received in early 
the decrease in noninterest income in as compared to was primarily a result of a decrease in trading and investment banking  the sale of the merchant discount operation in december  and a significant decline in trust income due to the sale of the employee benefit accounts in as the sale of the employee benefit accounts enabled the company to avoid significant capital expenditures  management believes that this sale will not have a significant impact on future earnings 
trust and securities processing consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts  custody of securities services  trust investments and money management services  and mutual fund assets servicing 
these fees increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the increase in trust and securities processing fees in as compared to was primarily a result of two items 
first  there was a million increase in fund administration fees from umb fund services as a result of services performed for new clients 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increases in management fees from the umb scout funds due to million of net inflows into the funds during as the income from these two segments are mostly linked to the market value of assets  the related income will be affected by changes in the securities markets 
management continues to emphasize sales of services to both new and existing clients as well as increasing and improving the distribution channels which lead to increased inflows into the umb scout funds 
the decrease in trust and securities processing in as compared to is primarily related to the sale of the company s employee benefits business and the loss of the assets under management from such employee benefit accounts 
trading and investment banking consists mostly of fees earned from the sale of bonds to the company s correspondent bank and non financial institution client base 
fees from such activity increased million  or in compared to and as compared to a decrease of million  or percent in compared to the decrease was mainly market driven as customers changed their positions of mortgaged backed securities  in  due to the heavy refinancing of real estate loans 
this returned to more normal trading levels in and 
table of contents service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or percent  in compared to and million  or percent  in compared to the increase in over was primarily a result of a million increase in individual overdraft and return item charges partially offset by a decrease in corporate service charges 
the increase in individual overdraft and return item charges is primarily due to pricing increases and changes in overdraft and collection procedures in the second half of as was the first full year of these new overdraft and collection procedures  the impact on future years is uncertain as it is greatly affected by customer behavior 
this increase from overdraft and return item charges was partially offset by decreases in corporate service charges 
corporate service charge income was adversely affected by increases in earnings credits on compensating balances 
due to the increase in interest rates  the earnings credits on compensating balances also increased correspondingly 
management has implemented a new tiered earnings credit policy in january which should help mitigate the impact of future increases in interest rates 
another area of potential future growth relates to the company s hsa health savings account and fsa flexible spending account healthcare initiatives where the company provides the payment mechanisms to support hsas and fsas 
these accounts could favorably impact fee income  interchange fee from electronic payments and the amount of deposits and assets under management 
to date  the company has entered into agreements with certain major healthcare providers  but the volume of such business and revenues associated with it cannot be reasonably forecast 
the increase in service charge income in as compared to is also related to the implementation of new overdraft procedures 
corporate service charge income is also affected by the shift of customer payments from paper to electronic although the company has focused significant resources into maintaining its cash management income levels  the external challenges facing the company make the impact of these changes on its income uncertain 
brokerage fees continue to decline 
brokerage fee income decreased by million  or percent in compared to brokerage fee income declined by million  or percent in compared to the primary reason for this decline is the continued decline in retail brokerage fee income due to decreased demand 
management has attempted to address this trend by realigning the brokerage business with its private client services division under new leadership 
management believes that this realignment will enable increases to future brokerage income through better distribution channels  as well as an increased sales focus 
bankcard fees increased by million in compared to after remaining relatively flat in as compared to the higher fees in reflect both an increase in overall card volume and the average per transaction dollar amount 
in  the credit card rebate programs were modified to encourage increased usage by both consumer and commercial customers 
additionally  the rise in gasoline prices as well as the general health of the economy impacted transaction activity 
continued growth in the commercial card segments and rapid transfer from offline to online debit card activity in the consumer segment is anticipated 
gains on sales of assets and deposits  net  increased by million in as compared to net gains of million 
there were no similar gains in the gains were primarily attributable to net gains on the sales of eleven banking facilities 
other gains in included a million gain related to the condemnation sale of a downtown kansas city banking facility to the city  as well as a million gain on the sale of a portion of land related to another kansas city banking facility 
the gain in was primarily related to the condemnation sale of a downtown kansas city parking lot 
gains on sale of employee benefit accounts represent earnout payments received in and as a result of the sale of employee benefit accounts announced in may the accounts were transferred in the first month of and a gain of million was recognized in such year 
in the first quarter of  an earnout payment of million was received based on the income received during the first twelve months on accounts transferred in gain on sale of merchant discount operation was recorded in december for million 
simultaneous with the sale of the merchant discount operation  a marketing agreement was executed whereby the company receives a share of future merchant discount income 
therefore  management believes that this sale will not have a significant impact on future earnings 

table of contents other income increased million  or percent  in compared to and increased million  or percent  in compared to noninterest expense noninterest expense in increased million  or percent  compared to  primarily due to a one time charge related to the vsp  higher processing fees  bankcard fees and other noninterest expense items 
these items were partially offset by decreases in salary and benefit costs  as well as a decrease in marketing and business development 
noninterest expense remained relatively flat in as compared to by decreasing by percent  or million 
as discussed below  it is anticipated that noninterest expense will increase in primarily due to investments in technology and personnel 
table summary of noninterest expense in thousands year ended december salaries and employee benefits occupancy  net equipment supplies and services marketing and business development processing fees legal and consulting bankcard amortization of intangibles other total noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits increased a nominal million  or percent  in compared to and decreased million in compared to although the overall change in salary and benefit expense from to was small  there was a million charge for payments made to employees under the vsp 
these higher costs were offset by decreases in staffing levels during to illustrate  the company s full time equivalent employees dropped from  at year end to  in further improvements came from a million decrease in health insurance related costs due primarily to the implementation of a new partially self funded insurance program in in  the implementation of new statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment will impact the expense recognized from equity based compensation 
it is anticipated that an additional million of expense will be recognized in for stock options outstanding at december  additional expense will be recognized for additional grants made in further  the hiring of certain key strategic sales personnel in late and the anticipated hiring of additional strategic sales personnel in will have an unfavorable impact on salary expense in the decrease in salary and benefits in was primarily the result of the savings achieved through the reduction of staffing levels due to the sale of the company s employee benefit business 
the number of full time equivalent employees dropped from  at year end to  at year end occupancy  net expense remained relatively flat from as compared to  but had increased by million  or percent in as compared to the increase in as compared to was due largely to the amortization of costs associated with the refurbishment of a building in the company s downtown kansas city campus  as well as the construction of new branches 
additionally  rental income from our office buildings decreased significantly during whether this decrease will continue into future years depends upon the company s ability to fully lease its vacant space  and the timing and conditions of any such leases are currently unknown 

table of contents equipment costs have increased moderately in both and equipment costs increased million  or percent  in compared to and increased million  or percent  in compared to the increases in and are primarily due to software upgrades to core systems 
due to commitments made to acquire or upgrade other core software systems check imaging software  commercial treasury management software upgrades  voice over internet protocol software  interactive voice response software upgrades  and customer relationship management software  management anticipates equipment costs to increase during marketing and business development decreased million  or percent  in as compared to due to a management shift in television and other media advertising to more local community sponsorships 
it is anticipated that although this decreased level will continue  it will be partially offset by increases in as a result of new marketing campaigns 
marketing expenses increased by million in over due to brand positioning  product enhancement and support costs and an increased emphasis on business development 
processing fees increased million  or percent  in compared to and increased million  or percent  in compared to the and increases were primarily the result of an increase in shareholder servicing and other administration fees paid to investment advisors related to the scout funds as a result of increases in assets under management for both years 
the amount of such fees paid in future years is dependent upon assets under management affected by both fund inflows as well as market values  and is expected to generally correlate to trends in the equity markets 
legal and consulting fees were relatively flat in as compared to  but had increased by million  or percent  in compared to the increase was primarily attributable to increased on going legal costs associated with the scout funds and with professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley act of compliance 
bankcard expenses increased by million  or percent  in as compared to bankcard expenses had also increased by million  or percent  in as compared to the increases in both and are primarily attributable to the implementation of a new platinum rebate program in for individual customers and enhancements to the rebate program for corporate customers in other expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to and remained relatively flat in as compared to the significant increase in as compared to is a result of many items including a million increase in operational charge offs primarily due to the new overdraft program  a million increase in charitable contributions  and the remainder from a variety of non operating charge offs 
management does not anticipate that such non operating charge offs will repeat in income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in  and compared to million in these expense levels equate to effective rates of percent  percent  and percent for   and respectively 
the primary reason for the difference between the company s effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is the effect of non taxable income from municipal securities and state and federal tax credits realized 
the increase in the effective tax rate in as compared to was a result of a million reduction in federal and state rehabilitation tax credits and net tax exempt income representing a smaller percentage of pre tax net income 
in  tax exempt income represented approximately percent of pre tax income as compared to percent of pre tax income in this had a percentage point impact on the effective tax rate in as compared to the decline in the effective tax rate between and resulted mainly from a net million reduction in federal and state tax expense as a result of federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits received the renovation of a downtown kansas city office building 
the net effect of the sale of state historic rehabilitation tax credits was approximately million in further  the 
table of contents effective income tax rate for included a reduction in the tax reserve resulting from a reassessment of ongoing risks associated with tax matters 
management believes that the effective tax rate will increase slightly in as no significant federal or state tax credits are anticipated 
strategic segments the company s operations are strategically aligned into six major segments commercial banking and lending  corporate services  banking services  consumer services  asset management  and investment services group 
the segments are differentiated by both the customers and the products and services offered 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes how these segments are identified and presents financial results of the segments for the years ended december   and the treasury and other adjustments category includes items not directly associated with any other segment 
commercial banking and lending s pre tax net income decreased from by million  or percent  to million 
in  the pre tax net income increased from by million  or percent  to million 
for  the decrease in net income was driven primarily by a decrease in net interest income of million or percent over this decrease was caused by higher funding costs associated with interest rate increases throughout the year 
a higher provision for loan losses  due to increases in loan balances  also contributed to the reduction in net income 
the net interest income increase in was due to the sustained low interest rate environment compared to and the corresponding impact on repricing of earning assets in that environment 
the increase should be at a more measured pace than slow improvement in net interest income is expected if interest rates continue to gradually rise or level off in corporate services pre tax net income increased million to million compared to a decrease of million to million in for  the increase is largely due to higher net interest income of million or percent 
the increase in is related to positive rate and volume variances compared to as interest rates rise 
the decline in margin in was due to lower yields on deposit balances as interest rates remained at historically low levels last year 
challenges for this segment arise from competitive pressures  as well as the technological challenges due to the movement from paper to electronic processing 
if interest rates continue to increase in  pressure will be placed on deposit service charge income which is impacted by earnings credits 
the company has focused significant resources into creating and enhancing products to keep the company in step with the client s changing needs 
management believes corporate trust will expand its market share in regions where the company has a physical presence outside of kansas and missouri due to an enhanced marketing emphasis 
management believes that the hsa product will be a source for growth in both deposit balances and noninterest income in banking services pre tax net income was million in  a decrease of million from the net income decreased by million from for  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income of million and an increase in noninterest expense of million 
net interest income is down due primarily to a million  or  decline in deposits as the increase in earnings credit rate decreased the required amount of compensating balances 
a change in deposit mix from noninterest bearing deposits to interest bearing repurchase agreements also helped fuel this movement 
this trend started in where net interest income decreased million from if this trend continues  future increases in interest rates would have an adverse effect on interest margin 
noninterest expense is up due to vsp expenses as well as fed pricing increases 
noninterest expense was up million in consumer services pre tax net income increased million to million  compared to a loss of million in the increase is attributable to a million dollar increase in noninterest income  a million increase in net interest income  and a million increase in noninterest expense 
fee income increased as a result of net account growth  the implementation of new service charges on depository products and from the sale of banking facilities 
the increase in the net interest income occurred as assets repriced in a higher interest rate environment and core deposits lagged 
the company continued to manage noninterest expenses very closely 
table of contents with emphasis on automation and staff efficiency 
management anticipates continued growth in service fee income in consumer services ability to increase net interest margin in will be dependent upon its ability to grow deposits and higher yielding consumer loans 
further  variable rate consumer loan products such as home equity lines of credit will benefit in a rising interest rate environment 
management believes that noninterest expense will increase in as a result of planned new branch openings and the investment in new product lines 
asset management s pre tax net income was million  which is a decrease of million or from this is compared to a million decrease in income from to the million increase in noninterest income from to was offset by a million increase in noninterest expense and a million decrease in net interest income 
noninterest income increased as a result of increased inflows into the scout funds 
noninterest expense also increased related to increased distribution fees from the funds related to the increased inflows of cash 
these fees are driven by asset values maintained in the funds 
management has had success in its efforts to increase cash inflows to the umb scout funds and will continue to focus sales efforts to continue this trend 
in march  the umb scout funds held a shareholder meeting to approve changes to the individual fund structures and organization 
the most significant change related to fee unbundling 
in the past  scout investment advisors  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  collected a fee from the funds and was responsible for paying expenses on behalf of the funds 
effective april   scout investment advisors charges an advisory fee and the individual funds pay direct expenses including accounting  administration  transfer agency and audit fees 
the company anticipates the overall decrease in expenses paid by the company will be greater than the reduced revenue received 
therefore  overall net income should increase 
investment services group s pre tax net income increased million or percent to million in  compared to a decrease of to million in from for  the increase is mostly due to a million increase in net interest income attributable to both higher interest rates and increased volume due to higher deposits 
net interest income was down in compared to due to lower average deposits maintained by mutual fund customers 
management believes that increased income from new customers added in will continue in  depending upon the overall uncertainties within the mutual fund industry and the overall health of the equity markets 
the net loss for the treasury and other adjustments category was million for  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for all years includes unallocated income tax expense for the consolidated company 
this segment includes the gain on the one time sale of the merchant bankcard discount processing activity that appears as noninterest income in it also includes the one time sale of the employee benefits accounts and federal and state rehabilitation tax credits during balance sheet analysis loans and loans held for sale loans represent the company s largest source of interest income 
loan balances increased by million in due to management s effort to focus on new commercial and consumer loan relationships  as well as the overall improvement in the economy 
commercial and real estate loans had the most significant growth in outstanding balances in as compared to included in table is a five year breakdown of loans by type 
it should be noted that during the first quarter of the company reviewed the classifications of loans to ensure that loans were properly recorded on the loan system  which resulted in the reclassification of million in loans from the commercial category to the commercial real estate category 
business related loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio  comprising approximately percent and percent of total loans at the end of and  respectively 
the company targets customers that will utilize multiple banking services and products

commercial loans increased in volume as well as percentage of total loans in from the increase is primarily a result of several factors including a renewed focus on sales efforts  a new incentive plan for loan officers and increased loan authority for regional presidents 
management anticipates loan growth in to be at a more measured pace than in as a percentage of total loans  commercial real estate and real estate construction loans now comprises of total loans  compared to at the end of generally  these loans are made for working capital or expansion purposes and are primarily secured by real estate with a maximum loan to value of 
many of these properties are owner occupied and have other collateral or guarantees as security 
bankcard loans have increased overall in as compared to  but have decreased slightly as a percentage of total loans 
the absolute increase in such loans represents the continued emphasis in this segment 

table of contents the increase in bankcard loans in was due primarily to increased promotional activity and reward programs 
a significant portion of the decrease in volume of bankcard loans in and was caused by a reduction in the private label portion of the portfolio 
this type of loan is generally less profitable than traditional bankcard loans and is likely to continue to decrease in volume 
other consumer installment loans have also shown an increase in total amount outstanding  but have decreased as a percentage of loans 
as many of these loans are linked to automobile financings  future loan volumes may be affected by the competitive environment including financing terms from auto makers  the overall economy and consumer debt levels 
the effects of such factors are uncertain 
real estate residential loans  although low in overall balances  have grown more rapidly than overall loan growth 
the growth in these loans is primarily attributable to home equity lines of credits heloc 
the heloc growth is a result of the success of multiple promotions  as well as market penetration within the company s current customer base through its current distribution channels 
continued expansion of this portfolio is anticipated 
nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans are discussed under credit risk within the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in item a on pages and of this report 
securities the company s security portfolio provides liquidity as a result of the composition and average life of the underlying securities 
this liquidity can be used to fund loan growth or to offset the outflow of traditional funding sources 
in addition to providing a potential source of liquidity  the security portfolio can be used as a tool to manage interest rate sensitivity 
the company s goal in the management of its securities portfolio is to maximize return within the company s parameters of liquidity goals  interest rate risk and credit risk 
the company maintains very high liquidity levels while investing in only high grade securities 
the security portfolio generates the company s second largest component of interest income 
securities available for sale and securities held to maturity comprised of earning assets as of december   compared to at year end securities totaled billion at december   compared to billion at year end collateral pledging requirements for public funds and loan demand are expected to be the primary factors impacting changes in the level of security holdings 
securities available for sale comprised of the company s securities portfolio at december   compared to at year end in order to improve the yields of the securities portfolio  the company has altered the mix and duration of its portfolio 
the mix has changed by reducing the outstanding balances of us treasury notes and moving to mortgage backed securities of us agencies and state and political subdivisions

there are us treasury obligations  federal agency mortgage backed securities  and municipal securities that have had unrealized losses for greater than months 
these unrealized losses are a result of interest rate volatility in the markets and not related to the credit quality of the investments

capital and liquidity the company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position  which promotes investor confidence  provides access to funding sources under favorable terms  and enhances the company s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities 
the company is not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that would materially change its capital position or affect its liquidity in the foreseeable future 
the company anticipates an increased level of capital expenditures in the near term with respect to technology 
these technology investments are mostly attributable to meeting the demands of a shift in the payments landscape from paper based to electronic based 
this capital investment which is discussed under noninterest expense section of this item on page is not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s overall capital position due to its strong capital and liquidity 
capital is managed for each subsidiary based upon its respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements 
total shareholders equity was million at december   compared to million one year earlier

risk based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies establish minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution s assets 
a financial institution s total capital is required to equal at least of risk weighted assets 
at least half of that must consist of tier core capital  and the remainder may be tier supplementary capital 
the risk based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset 
certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings

table of contents principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customers and suppliers  allowance for loan losses  bad debts  investments  financing operations  long lived assets  taxes  other contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the recorded estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the company s critical accounting policies are those relating to allowance for loan losses  goodwill and other intangibles  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  and accounting for stock based compensation 
allowance for loan losses the company s allowance for loan losses represents management s judgment of the loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained and computed at each bank at a level that such individual bank management considers adequate 
the allowance is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical trends  internal ratings  migration analysis  current economic conditions  loan growth and individual impairment testing 
larger commercial loans are individually reviewed for potential impairment 
those larger commercial loans that management deems probable that the borrower cannot meets its contractual obligations with respect to payment or timing are deemed to be impaired under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these loans are then reviewed for potential impairment based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of cash flows  collateral and other legal options 
any allowance related to the impairment of an individually impaired loan is based on the present value of discounted expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral  or the fair value of the loan 
based on this analysis  some loans that are classified as impaired under sfas do not have a specific allowance as there is no related impairment as the discounted expected future cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral exceeds the company s basis in such impaired loan 
the company also maintains an internal risk grading system for other loans not subject to individual impairment 
an estimate of the inherent loan losses on such risk graded loans is based on a migration analysis which computes the net charge off experience related to each risk category 
an estimate of inherent losses is computed on remaining loans based on the type of loan 
each type of loan is segregated into a pool based on the nature of such loans 
this includes remaining commercial loans that have a low risk grade  as well as homogenous loans 
homogenous loans include automobile loans  credit card loans and other consumer loans 
allowances are established for each pool based on the loan type using historical loss rates  certain statistical measures and loan growth 
an estimate of the total inherent loss is based on the above three computations 
from this an adjustment not to exceed ten percent can be made based on other factors management considers to be important in evaluating the probable losses in the portfolio such as general economic conditions  loan trends  risk management and loan administration and changes in internal policies 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
goodwill is assigned to various reporting units based upon those which were expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination at the time of the acquisition 
the 
table of contents company tests impairment at the reporting unit level by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if management s estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill  no impairment is deemed to occur 
in order to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  management uses multiples of earnings and assets from recent acquisition of similar banking and fund servicing entities as such entities have comparable operations and economic characteristics 
the company has performed annual impairment tests of goodwill since the inception of sfas  accounting for goodwill 
as a result of such impairment tests  the company has not recognized an impairment charge 
for customer based identifiable intangibles  the company is amortizing the intangible over their estimated useful lives of up to ten years 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  premises and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment review for long lived assets includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets to their current carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and with interest charges  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
no events or changes in circumstances occurred in  or which would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is the recording of interest on loans and securities and is recognized based on rate multiplied by the principal amount outstanding 
interest accrual is discontinued when  in the opinion of management  the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful  or  the loan is past due for a period of ninety days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection 
other noninterest income is recognized as services are performed or revenue generating transactions are executed 
equity based compensation stock based compensation is recognized using the intrinsic value method for disclosure purposes 
pursuant to the requirements of fas  accounting for stock based compensation  pro forma net income and earnings per share are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma disclosures reflect the impact on earnings as if the fair value method had been applied to outstanding stock options using the black scholes valuation method 
please see the discussion of fas r  issued in december  under note  new accounting pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange prices  commodity prices or equity prices 
financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading 
the company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading 
the following discussion of interest risk  however  combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial 

table of contents interest rate risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
to minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses  the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its funds management committee fmc and approved by the company s board of directors 
the fmc has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate exposure 
the company s primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk is the net interest income simulation analysis 
the company also uses a net portfolio value model to measure market value risk under various rate change scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at specific points in time 
the company does not use hedges or swaps to manage interest rate risk except for limited use of futures contracts to offset interest rate risk on certain securities held in its trading portfolio 
overall  the company manages interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk  remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability  liquidity  interest rate risk and credit risk 
net interest income modeling the company s primary interest rate risk tool  the net interest income simulation analysis  measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin 
this analysis incorporates substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
through these simulations management estimates the impact on net interest income of a basis point upward or downward gradual change eg ramp of market interest rates over a one year period 
assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis  management outlook and repricing strategies 
asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes 
since the results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized  management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results to changes in assumptions 
table shows the net interest income increase or decrease over the next twelve months as of december  and table market risk in thousands net interest income rates in basis points december  amount of change december  amount of change static the company is less sensitive to an increase or decrease in rates than a year ago 
this is due to the fact that overall rates were higher in than in  the company s average life of the investment portfolio has gradually lengthened and the company has more time deposits than a year ago 
overall  the company remains susceptible to a decrease in interest rates because of this increase in time deposits as well as an increase in the amount of variable rate loans 
these variable rate loans could reprice downward in a falling interest rate environment see table below 
however  this same asset sensitivity projects the company to be favorably affected by a gradual increase in interest rates 

table of contents repricing mismatch analysis the company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time 
while a traditional repricing mismatch analysis gap analysis provides a snapshot of interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not  in fact  reprice at the same time or the same degree 
also  it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
management attempts to structure the balance sheet to provide for the repricing of approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities within specific time intervals 
table is a static gap analysis  which presents the company s assets and liabilities  based on their repricing or maturity characteristics 
this analysis shows that the company is in a positive gap position because assets maturing or repricing exceed liabilities

the policy limits the amount and type of securities that can be carried in the trading account as well as requiring that any limits under applicable law and regulations also be complied with  and mandates the use of a value at risk methodology to manage price volatility risks within financial parameters 
the risk associated with the carrying of trading securities is offset by the sale of exchange traded financial futures contracts  with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily 
this account had a balance of million as of december   compared to million as of december  the manager of the investment banking division of umb bank  na presents documentation of the methodology used in determining value at risk at least annually to the board for approval in compliance with occ banking circular  risk management of financial derivatives  and other banking laws and regulations 
the aggregate value at risk is reviewed quarterly 
the aggregate value at risk in the trading account was negligible as of december  and other market risk the company does not have material commodity price risks or derivative risks 
credit risk credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers 
the company utilizes a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  loan requests are centrally reviewed to insure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
in addition  
table of contents the company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the affiliate banks 
this review team performs periodic examinations of each bank s loans for credit quality  documentation and loan administration 
the respective regulatory authority of each affiliate bank also reviews loan portfolios 
another means of ensuring loan quality is diversification of the portfolio 
by keeping its loan portfolio diversified  the company has avoided problems associated with undue concentrations of loans within particular industries 
commercial real estate loans comprise only of total loans  with no history of significant losses 
the company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses  all is discussed on pages and also  please see table for a five year analysis of the all 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends including a migration analysis  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
a primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans 
nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans 
the company s nonperforming loans decreased million at december   compared to a decrease of million a year earlier 
the major portion of nonperforming loans is due to three commercial loan customers 
the company s nonperforming loans have not exceeded of total loans in any of the last five years 
while the company plans to increase its loan portfolio  management does not intend to compromise the company s high credit standards as it grows its loan portfolio 
the impact of future loan growth on the allowance for loan losses is uncertain as it is dependent on many factors including asset quality and changes in the overall economy 
the company had no other real estate owned as of december  and loans past due more than days totaled million at december   compared to million at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due days or more and or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted 
the accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash 
certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers 
the company had no restructured loans at december   compared to  at december

the company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds 
ultimately  public confidence is generated through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the primary source of liquidity for the company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets  which include billion of high quality securities available for sale 
the liquidity of the company and its affiliate banks is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits 
neither the company nor its subsidiaries are active in the debt market 
the traditional funding source for the company s subsidiary banks has been core deposits 
the company has not issued any debt since when million of medium term notes were issued to fund bank acquisitions 
prior to being paid off in february  these notes were rated a by moody s investor service and a by standard and poor s 
based upon regular contact with investment banking firms  management is confident in its ability to raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms  should the need arise 
the company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity 
these commitments include unused commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  and commercial letters of credit 
the total amount of these commercial commitments at december   was billion 
the company believes that since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the company 
the company s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders  debt service and treasury stock purchases 
management fees and dividends received from subsidiary banks traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future 
the company s subsidiary banks are subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the company 
for the most part  all banks can pay dividends at least equal to their current year s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval 
from time to time  approvals have been requested to allow a subsidiary bank to pay a dividend in excess of its current earnings 
all such requests have been approved 

table of contents operational risk the company is exposed to numerous types of operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency  or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
included in the legal and regulatory issues with which the company must comply are a number of recently imposed rules resulting from the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of the company operates in many markets and places reliance on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control systems  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation
