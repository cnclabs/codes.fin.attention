overview cubist is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in lexington  massachusetts  focused on the research  development and commercialization of antiinfective products that address unmet medical needs 
we have one marketed product  cubicin 
our focus in was to continue the successful promotion and development of cubicin by seeking additional indications and supporting the planned launch of cubicin in europe by chiron 
in  we completed our phase study of cubicin for the treatment of infective endocarditis and complicated bacteremia caused by s 
aureus 
in june  we announced that the trial met its primary end points  and in september  we filed a snda with the fda seeking priority review for approval to add bacteremia with known or suspected endocarditis caused by s 
aureus to the indication statement for cubicin 
the fda notified us in november that the snda was accepted and has been granted priority review status 
by granting priority review status to cubicin  the fda has established a target date to act on the snda filing by march  on march   cubist s snda will be the focus of the fda s anti infective advisory committee 
in january  the emea granted chiron marketing approval for cubicin in the eu 
chiron plans to launch cubicin in the uk and netherlands in early march  while proceeding with pricing negotiations necessary in other eu markets  which are to be phased in throughout we launched cubicin in november and recognized net product revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we hired additional sales professionals in the first quarter of and in the fourth quarter of  we announced that we expect to hire an additional sales professionals with the objective of increasing both depth and breadth of our sales force in order to be prepared if the fda approves our snda to add s 
aureus bacteremia with known or suspected endocarditis to the indication statement for cubicin 
we continue to sell cubicin in accordance with our drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers but shipments are sent directly to our end users  which allows us greater visibility into end user ordering and reordering trends 
we outsource many of our supply chain activities  including manufacturing and supplying cubicin api  converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation  managing warehousing and distribution of cubicin to our customers  and performing the order processing  order fulfillment  shipping  collection and invoicing services related to our cubicin product sales 
we have focused our pipeline building efforts on opportunities that leverage our antiinfective and acute care discovery  development  and commercialization expertise 
currently  our research and development priorities include our lipopeptide program  the product candidate hepex b  and our natural products screening program 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million results of operations years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth revenues for the year ended december  and december  change in millions product revenues  net license fee revenues collaborative agreement and other revenues total revenues  net product revenues  net net sales of cubicin were million and million in and  respectively 
gross sales of cubicin totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and are offset by million and million of allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks  prompt pay discounts and wholesaler management fees 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased customer volume 
also impacting net product revenues was a price increase in october and a price increase in november we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product 
in the future  we may shift from the drop ship program to a program that may allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  however  we have not determined if or when the change will occur 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking purchases and provisions for returns based on estimated product in the distribution channel 
leading wholesalers have begun to seek various fees for data supply and administration services 
net product revenue is reduced by any such fees paid to the wholesalers 
license fee revenues total license fee revenues in the year ended december   were million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in our license revenues from to is primarily due to a decrease of million of revenue related to our cross license agreement with diversa corporation  or diversa  and a decrease of million of revenue related to our license agreement with chiron 
in  we recognized million of previously deferred license fee revenue related to our cross license agreement with diversa upon the expiration of a repayment provision 
under the chiron agreement  we received up front payments totaling million  including a million premium paid upon purchasing our common stock 
this million was recorded as deferred revenue and was amortized to license fee revenues over the estimated development period of the agreement of two years which was completed in september the final million of revenue related to these deferred amounts was recognized during the year ended december   as compared to million of revenue recognized for the year ended december  collaborative agreement and other revenues total collaborative agreement and other revenues in the year ended december   were million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
included in collaborative agreement and other revenues for the year ended december   is million of development revenue from our commercialization agreement with chiron compared to million of development revenue for the year ended december   and million of small business innovation research  or sbir  grant revenue in the year ended december   compared to million of sbir grant revenue in the year ended december  costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the year ended december  and december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
our gross margin for the year ended december   was as compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to reduced overall pricing from our manufacturing vendors as well as higher volume resulting in lower cost per unit sold 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly 
in march of  we issued to eli lilly million of our common stock in exchange for a reduction in the royalties payable to eli lilly 
in  we made payments to eli lilly totaling million in the form of common stock related to our license agreement with eli lilly 
these amounts have been capitalized on our balance sheet as intangible assets and are amortized to cost of product revenues over the remaining life of our license agreement with eli lilly 
amortization included in cost of product revenues related to these expenses was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
as our production volumes increase  there is the potential for our gross margin to increase as we work to develop manufacturing process improvements 
whether that potential can be realized and the extent to which such potential can be realized are uncertain 
research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease from to is primarily due to million of costs incurred in related to the cab program which was discontinued in  a decrease of million in clinical trial expenses and a decrease of million in costs related to the establishment of a second api manufacturer and a second fill finish manufacturer for our cubicin product  which both became fully operational in the first quarter of these decreases were partially offset by million in increased manufacturing development costs incurred in associated with our license agreement with chiron  an increase of million in medical education expenses and an increase of million in lab services expenses 
we expect to continue incurring substantial research and development expenses related to i phase and phase clinical trials for cubicin  ii pre clinical and clinical testing of other products under development  such as hepex b and potential compounds under our discovery research program  iii manufacturing and formulation development costs related to hepex b  iv regulatory matters  and v medical affairs activities 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to an increase of million in salaries  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to our sales force expansion in the first quarter of as well as an increase in expenses in anticipation of the possible approval by the fda to expand cubicin s label for use in s 
aureus bacteremia with known or suspected endocarditis 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase in as we continue our commercialization efforts related to cubicin in the us and expand our sales force by an additional sales professionals in the first quarter of general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in general and administrative expense is primarily due to the million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of to write down a patent  unrelated to our cubicin product  to its net realizable value 
also contributing to the decrease is million of lower depreciation and amortization expense  primarily due to the lower patent amortization per month as a result of the patent impairment charge 
these decreases are offset primarily by million of higher salaries and other employee related expenses as a result of our growth 
other expense  net the following table sets forth other expense  net for the year ended december  and december  change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense total other expense  net interest income and expense interest income in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in interest income was due to a higher average cash balance throughout as compared to and as a result of holding more investments in auction rate securities which have had a higher rate of return as compared to our other investment vehicles 
interest expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
we repaid the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes in december our remaining debt obligation as of december   relates to our million aggregate principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes due in interest expense related to our million aggregate principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes was approximately million for both years ended december  and interest expense related to our senior convertible notes was zero and approximately million in and  respectively

license fee revenues total license fee revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in our license revenues from to primarily relates to our license agreement with chiron  which included up front payments totaling million  including a million premium paid upon purchasing our common stock 
this million was recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized to license fee revenues over the estimated development period of the agreement of two years 
revenue of million was recognized under this agreement during the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  also included in license fee revenues for the year ended december  is million of revenue  which was previously deferred  related to our cross license agreement with diversa 
under the agreement  diversa paid an up front license fee and pays annual license maintenance fees  until the licensed patents expire 
we were required to repay the up front license fee if  prior to november   we merged with or were acquired by a company whose primary business  prior to november   was related to molecular breeding involving in vitro dna shuffling 
accordingly  the entire upfront licensing fee was recorded as deferred revenue and was taken into revenue upon the expiration of the repayment provision in november collaborative agreement and other revenues total collaborative agreement and other revenues in the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in our collaborative agreement and other revenues from to primarily relates to i million of small business innovation research grants  or sbir grants  recognized in versus million recognized in  ii million of revenue recognized in related to funded development from chiron versus no revenue recognized in  and iii million in grant revenue related to our uk subsidiary versus no revenue in these increases were offset by a decrease of million in collaborative agreement and other revenues from to related to the completion in february of our research collaboration agreement with novartis under which we recognized million of revenue in versus no revenue in costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the year ended december  and december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million in the year ended december  and  respectively

research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase from to is primarily related to i costs of million associated with the research and development of hepex b which was in licensed in june of  ii an increase of million in salaries  benefits and other employee related expenses  iii an increase of million in clinical studies related to additional indications for cubicin  and iv million of expenses associated with the process of getting a second cubicin api manufacturer and a second fill finish site up and running for cubicin 
these increases were offset by decreases of i million in costs related to the cab and octx programs which were discontinued in  ii million of costs associated with getting the first cubicin api manufacturer operational in  and iii million of facility related expenses primarily related to the closure of the uk facility in in march  we finalized the total number of employees that would relocate to the us from our us facility 
the total severance and outplacement costs for employees who did not relocate to the us and were terminated prior to or upon the august  closing of the uk facility was  million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas  this charge was taken ratably through the employees actual termination dates 
expense of million was recorded for the year ended december  sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily related to an increase of million in salaries  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to having a fully staffed cubicin sales and marketing group in place for all of as well as an increase of million in marketing and promotional programs for cubicin 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily relates to the lease termination charges of million recorded in related to our former uk facility 
in february  our uk subsidiary entered into a binding letter of intent to lease approximately  square feet of additional space in slough  england  commencing in february for a term of fifteen years 
in the third quarter of we decided that we would not occupy the additional space 
in accordance with sfas an expense of million was recorded for the year ended december  based on the execution of an agreement in january to buy out of the lease for million payable in two lump sum payments in january and september sfas requires that a liability be recorded for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at its fair value in the period during which the liability is incurred 
the million included million of lease termination costs  a million write off of construction in progress costs  million in other tenant related costs  and an elimination of the deferred rent liability of million related to the facility s lease term 
we made the first payment of million million in january and the final payment of million million in september under the lease termination agreement 
this decrease was offset by a million patent impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of as well as a million increase in professional services fees 
the patent impairment was determined as a result of the most recent assessment of future revenue streams related to the patent 
we estimated that the discounted future cash flows from the patent  unrelated to our cubicin product  was less than its carrying value  resulting in the million impairment charge 
other expense  net the following table sets forth other expense  net for the year ended december  and december  change in millions interest income interest expense other expense total other expense  net interest income and expense interest income in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in interest income was due to a lower average cash balance throughout as compared to interest expense was million in the years ended december  and interest expense related to our million aggregate principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes was approximately million for both years ended december  and interest expense related to our senior convertible notes was approximately million in and million in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the million pay down of debt in december  offset by a three percent prepayment penalty of million due to the payoff of the remaining million balance of these notes in december we also repaid the outstanding principal and interest of million on our citizen s term loan in october included in interest expense for the years ended december  and is million and million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs 
other expense other expense in the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in other expense from to is due to foreign exchange translation losses of million recorded in primarily related to the remeasurement of the slough lease termination accrual that was denominated in british pounds 
this liability was repaid in liquidity and capital resources currently  we require cash to fund our working capital needs  to purchase capital assets  and to pay our debt service  including principal  interest and capital lease obligations 
we fund our cash requirements through the following methods sales of cubicin  payments from our strategic collaborators including license fees  sponsored research funding and research grants  equity and debt financings  equipment financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  principally as a result of research and development efforts including pre clinical testing and clinical trials

we expect to incur significant expenses in the future for the continued development and commercialization of cubicin for additional indications  the development of our other drug candidates  as well as investments in other product opportunities 
our total cash  cash equivalents and investments at december   were million as compared to million at december  based on our current business plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investments and projected cash inflows from revenues will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligation and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least certain economic or strategic factors may require that we seek to raise additional cash by selling debt or equity securities 
however  such funds may not be available when needed  or  we may not be able to obtain funding on favorable terms  or at all 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in includes our net loss for the year of million offset by non cash charges of million that primarily consists of million of depreciation and amortization expense and million in expense associated with our k company match that is made in the form of common stock shares 
inventory increased million primarily due to increased purchases from our manufacturing vendors as we build a sufficient supply of cubicin to meet projected sales requirements 
accounts receivable increased million due to increased product sales of cubicin in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of our deferred revenue balance decreased due to the recognition of amounts deferred related to our license agreement with chiron corporation 
these uses of cash were offset by a million increase in operating cash flows due to an increase in accounts payable and accruals primarily due to an increase in accrued royalties owed to eli lilly on sales of cubicin and amounts owed to our manufacturing vendors for inventory purchases 
net cash provided by investing activities in was million  compared to million used in investing activities in and million provided by investing activities in purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december   were million compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

we have subleased the space located at sidney street through october the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent minimum volumes that we are required to purchase from our contract manufacturers 
the external collaboration listed above represents minimum royalties owed on sales of cubicin product 
critical accounting policies and estimates cubist prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  accrued clinical research costs  investments  long lived assets  and income taxes 
i 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended by sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin  license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaborative agreements with biotechnology companies 
we have followed the following principles in recognizing revenue product revenues  net we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and rebates are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales in the same period the related sales are recorded 
since the launch of cubicin in november  we have not allowed wholesalers to stock cubicin  instead we instituted a drop ship program that we have continued to maintain 
under our drop ship program  orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and outpatient administration centers 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and outpatient administration center purchases of our product  and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of level inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted appropriately 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on estimated product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
reserves for rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were  and  at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks and wholesaler management fees are netted against accounts receivable and were million and  at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model that we currently operate under  and the low level of actual product returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims experienced to date  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
multiple element arrangements we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
we have an arrangement that included an up front license payment and that obligated us to perform development services and to manufacture and supply drug product 
the pricing for the manufacturing and supply services was determined to be at fair value 
although the license was determined to have standalone value  we could not establish fair value for the development services and  as such  the license and development services were accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  the up front license payment was recognized over the estimated development period of two years 
our estimate of the development period and our determination that the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement are at fair value both involve management judgment 
license revenues non refundable license fees are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are generally recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
if an agreement contains product development services  the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized and as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of product development quarterly 
milestones revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
contingent payments under license agreements that do not involve substantial effort on the part of the company are not considered substantive milestones 
such payments are recognized as revenue when the contingency is met only if there are no remaining performance obligations or any remaining performance obligations are priced at fair value 
otherwise  the contingent payment is recognized as the company completes its performance obligations under the arrangement 
research services revenues from sbir grants to conduct research and development are recognized as the eligible costs are incurred up to the granted funding limit 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  basis 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
accrued clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of the study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those with a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements and that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
iv 
investments it is our intent to hold all investments to maturity in accordance with our investment policy 
however  if the circumstances regarding an investment were to change  such as a change in an investment s external credit rating  we would consider a sale of the related security to minimize any losses 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each reporting date 
v 
long lived assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which ranges from years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangibles assets are impaired 
in  based on an internal analysis  we estimated that the undiscounted future cash flows from a patent  unrelated to its cubicin product  were less than its carrying value  indicating that the patent was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  based upon the difference between the expected discounted future cash flows and its carrying value 
the million charge was recorded to general and administrative expense 
vi 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we determine that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   we believe it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or over many periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas changes the requirements of the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and also provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of error corrections 
prior to sfas  most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including in net income of the period of change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that the provisions of sfas will have a significant impact on its results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on a prospective basis in the first quarter of as a result of the provisions of sfas r  we expect the compensation charges under sfas r to be in the range of million to million for the year ended december  however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and the timing of employee stock option grants 
we will recognize compensation cost for stock based awards issued after december   on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments is held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to our policy to hold these instruments to maturity  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december   the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes due in amounted to million 
the interest rate on the convertible subordinated notes and capital lease obligations is fixed and is therefore not subject to interest rate risk
