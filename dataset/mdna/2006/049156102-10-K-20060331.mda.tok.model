critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements also requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  sales returns and allowances  bad debts and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products to customers  giving consideration to product shipping terms 
receivables are currently due from customers based on negotiated payment terms 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on specific review and analysis of customer account balances and historical trends 
an allowance for sales returns is recorded based on management s estimate of product returns  primarily based on historical trends 
we perform ongoing credit assessments of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
while historical credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established  it is possible that future credit losses could be higher or lower 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
management periodically reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management 
table of contents to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may differ from actual results  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
goodwill we review goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets below their carrying value 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate valuation methods 
specifically  we have goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of acquired businesses  of million net of accumulated amortization of million at december  and based upon our analysis  we have determined there are no indicators of an impairment of goodwill as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
although we currently believe that the estimates of each reporting unit s fair value used in the evaluation of goodwill are reasonable  differences between actual and expected revenue  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  we would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial position 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
our reserve for health insurance claims incurred but not paid is based on historical claims information 
in addition  we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs 
we establish reserves for workers compensation claims utilizing insurance industry loss development factors  as well as specific estimates of settlement costs for individual claims 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may have a material effect on our group health insurance and workers compensation costs

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments  including stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date  and a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas r as of january  using the modified prospective method 
the adoption resulted in unrecognized compensation cost of approximately  as of january  related to unvested options as calculated using the black scholes model 
recognition of such compensation to expense was  for the period prior to our agreement to cancel all outstanding options 
upon cancellation of the options  the remaining unrecognized compensation cost of  was expensed see also note new accounting standards 
no further compensation expense will be recognized related to share based payments until any new share based payments are made 
statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  amends arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have not adopted sfas as of december   however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb recently issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
statement is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board iasb toward development of a single set of accounting standards 
statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  the statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks that may impact our financial condition and financial results due to changing interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risks 
interest rate risk on march   the company replaced its then existing credit facility and entered into a new financing agreement resulting in total variable rate debt of million outstanding at december   compared with million at december  based on the company s variable rate obligations outstanding at december   and december   each basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would  respectively  increase or decrease annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately million in both years 
such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt for all maturities and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
on june   the company entered into an interest rate swap contract  with a notional amount of million  to effectively fix the interest rate at on a portion of its floating rate debt 
the company uses this interest rate swap agreement to manage its exposure of interest rate changes on the company s variable rate debt 
foreign exchange rate risk we have a canadian dollar bank account and therefore are exposed to foreign exchange currency market risk 
we have determined this risk to be immaterial at both december  and december  based on the balance maintained in that account and the overall level of our canadian operations
