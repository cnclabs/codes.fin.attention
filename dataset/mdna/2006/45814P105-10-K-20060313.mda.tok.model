item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an explanation of forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to our business we are subject to interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various 
table of contents governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although we believe we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates or continual flattening or inversion of the yield curve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to lending risk there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate 
increases in interest rates  minimum required payments  energy prices and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of the collateral securing loans  or demand for our loan products 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate and consumer loans  which make up the remaining of our loan portfolio 
because the portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for possible loan losses may be insufficient we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
this reserve represents our best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in our judgment is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of various factors  including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of regulatory examinations  and current economic conditions 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for possible loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for possible loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for possible loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the states of indiana  illinois  kentucky  and ohio our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in southern indiana  southern illinois and western and northeast kentucky 
in addition  we have commercial real estate loan production lpo offices located in cleveland and cincinnati ohio  as well as louisville  kentucky 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
additionally  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
some of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
local or privately held community banking organizations in certain markets may price or structure their products in such a way that it makes it difficult for us to compete in those markets in a way that allows us to meet our profitability or credit goals 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships 
the ability to expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services 
customer satisfaction 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect several areas  including our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  and requirements to maintain the confidentially of information relating to our customers 
congress and federal agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation of statutes  regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  
table of contents regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in fraud  operational or other losses that adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fraud risks could include fraud by employees  vendors  customers or anyone we or our customers do business or come in contact with 
the parent company relies on dividends from integra bank for most of its revenue the parent company  integra bank corporation  is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from the bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the parent company s common stock and interest and principal on the parent company s debt 
federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the parent company 
also  a holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to the parent company  the parent company may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from the bank could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value we seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company 
exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company 
difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company 
potential disruption to our business 
potential diversion of our management s time and attention 
the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company 
difficulty in estimating the value of the target company 
we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our local markets  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems  including risks to data integrity 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successfully in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings as previously reported  the internal revenue service irs has been examining the company s federal income tax return 
that examination is now complete  and on august   the company received a notice of proposed deficiency in which the irs asserted that adjustments should be made generating federal income tax liability for the company s tax year 
the most significant proposed adjustment relates to a position the irs has taken with respect to the company s treatment of mortgage loans held in the company s investment portfolio at december  the irs has asserted that all such mortgage loans should be treated as held for sale  and therefore subjected to the mark to market rules 
applying the mark to market rules to the company s mortgage loans held in their investment portfolio at december   would increase the company s taxable income for that year by an amount equal to the cumulative appreciation of these mortgage loans to their fair value 
if the irs ultimately were to prevail on its position with respect to mortgage loans held in the company s investment portfolio 
table of contents as of december   the company would owe approximately million in additional federal income tax  plus interest 
any such additional taxes due would be a result of timing differences 
as these mortgage loans pay off or down the tax liability will reverse and therefore will not impact the earnings of the company 
however  there would be an income statement impact to the extent interest is owed 
the company has engaged shearman sterling llp as special tax counsel to represent the company in this matter and has consulted with shearman sterling llp and pricewaterhousecoopers llp  the company s regular tax advisor

overview in  the company continued to build on its three year strategic plan to build shareholder value by improving its performance relative to peers 
the plan consists of four key elements accelerate revenue growth improve operating efficiency provide quality service  develop employees and continue to increase our managerial depth lower the company s risk profile by reducing non performing loans management believes that the successful execution of these elements will result in above average earnings growth with increased consistency and a lower risk profile 
in  the company made important strides towards accomplishing its goals 
new customers were the primary driver of increased revenue 
positive loan growth was generated in retail and commercial banking  especially in commercial real estate 
loan balances for commercial real estate reached the level that was expected in year three by the end of its second year 
the rollout of high performance checking was positively received in all of the company s markets 
new branches were on plan and mystery shops demonstrated that customers are very pleased with the improved level of service 
the referral rate from customers and employees increased dramatically over the past year 
net income for the year was  representing the highest level in five years 
this compares to a loss of  in the loss in resulted from a balance sheet restructuring that is further described in the net interest income section of this document

this single loan represents of the company s non performing loans at year end 
management continues to believe that the company is adequately reserved for this specific credit exposure 
the company utilizes various financial measures to evaluate its performance against the objectives of its strategic plan  many of which were discussed above 
there were several factors that had an impact on the comparability of the year to year results 
these items and the company s financial results are more fully discussed in the following sections of this report

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the section labeled credit management contained in management s discussion and analysis provides additional information 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 

table of contents changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of market value the estimation of market value is significant to several of the company s assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  mortgage servicing rights  other real estate owned  as well as market values associated with derivative financial instruments and goodwill and other intangibles 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or market value 
market values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the market value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
market values for securities available for sale are based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  market values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the market values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted market values while the market values of mortgage servicing rights are based on discounted cash flow analysis utilizing dealer consensus prepayment speeds and market discount rates 
the market values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
the market values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment no less than annually by applying a fair value based test using net present value of estimated net cash flows 
impairment exists when the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
core deposit intangibles are recorded at fair value  based on a discounted cash model valuation at the time of acquisition and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
mortgage servicing rights msrs represent an estimate of the present value of future cash servicing income  net of estimated costs  the company expects to receive on loans sold with servicing retained 
msrs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained 
the carrying value of msrs is amortized in proportion to and over the period of net servicing income and this amortization is recorded as a reduction to income 
the carrying value of the msrs asset is periodically reviewed for impairment based on the fair value of the msrs 
the company disaggregates its servicing rights portfolio based on loan type and interest rate  which are the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
any impairment would need to be reported as a valuation allowance 
a primary factor influencing the fair value is the estimated life of the underlying loans serviced 
the estimated life of the loans serviced is significantly influenced by market interest rates 
during a period of declining interest rates  the fair value of the msrs should decline due to an expected increase in prepayments within the portfolio 
alternatively  during a period of rising interest rates the fair value of msrs should increase as prepayments on the underlying loans would be expected to decline 
on an ongoing basis  management considers relevant factors to estimate the fair value of the msrs to be recorded when the loans are initially sold with servicing retained 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
investment tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized

net interest income net interest income is on a tax equivalent basis and is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense paid on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates  changes in interest rates  and by changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the schedule following the three year average balance sheet analysis 
the change in net interest income not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

tax exempt income  such as interest on loans and securities of state and political subdivisions  has been increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
net interest income for was  or lower than the decrease was primarily due to the effects of a flattening yield curve during which resulted in increased funding costs that exceeded the increase in asset yields  and a reduction in the securities portfolio that was offset by an increase in loans  partially offset by a net reduction of borrowings 
the flattening of the yield curve negatively impacted the company as more liabilities matured or repriced in the short term than did some of the assets those liabilities were funding 
additional information about the major contributors to the change in net interest income from to is as follows average earning assets decreased  or  driven by decreases in average securities balances of  partially offset by increases in average loan balances of  this change was in line with the company s strategy of reducing securities balances and improving the mix of earning assets 
the increase in average loan balances was driven by increases in commercial loans of  the majority of which came in the area of commercial real estate  increases in consumer loans of  and declines in residential mortgages of  the reduction of the securities portfolio also resulted in a reduction of the wholesale borrowings funding that portfolio 

table of contents a change in the company s timing of assessing daily overdraft fees on overdraft loans resulted in a reduction of these fees by this change was by design and was a component of a new high performance checking initiative 
this initiative included the redesign of the company s transaction accounts  and changes in several of the fees associated with those accounts  including the daily overdraft fee 
during the second quarter  the company sold three branches that included  in loans and  in deposits  including  in valuable core deposits 
average loan yields increased  contributing  of additional income over higher deposit rates increased interest expense by  while the average cost of borrowings increased adding  in interest expense 
the majority of the securities portfolio is comprised of fixed rate instruments  while wholesale funding includes a considerable volume of short term public certificates of deposit  repurchase agreements and other floating rate debt 
as rates increased  the spread between the investments and the liabilities funding them decreased 
while this spread declined during  it remains positive  further reductions in investment balances would likely decrease net interest income but improve the overall net interest margin 
during the second quarter  a write down of of premiums for acquired loans was recorded in connection with management s most recent evaluation of the remaining period of amortization 
prepayments of the related loans were occurring more frequently than originally estimated 
net interest income for was  or higher than the increase was primarily due to the balance sheet restructuring in the first quarter of and pricing discipline through both in deposits and loans 
in  the company completed a balance sheet restructuring and prepaid  in long term fhlb advances with an average yield of  incurring a charge of   after tax to extinguish the debt 
the company funded a portion of the fhlb debt extinguishment by reducing its investment portfolio by approximately  this action improved integra s interest rate risk profile by reducing the amount of assets susceptible to prepayments and in a rising rate environment reduces extension risk 
a gain of   after tax was recognized on the sale of securities 
the average yield on the securities sold was and their duration was approximately years 
the final component of the balance sheet restructuring included  of new fixed rate borrowings with final maturities ranging from to years  having an average life of approximately years and an average cost of 
additionally  the company issued  of subordinated debt and paid off the outstanding balance on its line of credit 
the company used the surplus cash proceeds from these transactions to reduce short term borrowings 
earning assets averaged  in compared to  in the decrease was due mainly to the balance sheet restructuring 
average interest bearing liabilities were  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in liabilities was due primarily from the reduction in fhlb borrowings during the balance sheet restructuring 
the net interest margin for the twelve months ended december  was compared to for the same period one year prior 
the basis points increase in margin was mainly the result of the balance sheet restructuring and monitoring and control of deposit pricing 
although rates increased in  a soft loan market resulted in tighter loan pricing which offset the increase 
another result of the balance sheet restructuring was the decrease in average earning assets  which decreased  to  in securities  which were sold during the restructuring  were the main component of the  decrease from the impact of this repositioning was a basis point increase in security yield to in average loans held for sale decreased  as a result of slowing mortgage loan refinancing demand which was primarily due to higher mortgage loan rates 
average loans also decreased  in the major factors causing this decrease were lower loan demand in the midwest and the sale of the company s credit card portfolio  which decreased loans by  the mix of earning assets shows average loans to average earning assets increased from in and in to in average valuable core deposits which include demand deposits both interest bearing and non interest bearing  money market and savings  increased  in this was offset by a decrease of  in certificates of 
table of contents deposits and other time deposits 
these lower interest valuable core deposits and the pricing discipline the company maintained throughout lowered the interest costs on deposits basis points in a rising rate environment 
primarily as a result of the balance sheet restructuring  average short term borrowings decreased  or  and average long term borrowings decreased  or  in average short term borrowings cost rose basis points mainly as a result of the federal funds rate increasing basis points throughout the year 
this increase was offset by a decrease in the cost of long term borrowings

commercial loans  which include commercial  industrial and agricultural  commercial real estate  and construction and development  increased  at december  compared to year end this increase was driven primarily by an increase in commercial construction and development loans originated by the company s commercial real estate line of business

since the inception of this line of business  this portfolio has not experienced any charge offs or delinquencies  while generating returns in excess of those originally forecasted when the strategy was launched 
commercial  industrial and agricultural loans increased  or from year end this increase was due to a variety of factors and not tied specifically to any one market or industry

this strategy impacted commercial and commercial real estate loan originations 
residential mortgage loans decreased  or from year end a continued increase in interest rates resulted in lower demand  including less refinance activity 
the flattening of the yield curve resulted in a narrowing of the rate differential between fixed and adjustable rate products  contributing to a reduction in adjustable rate mortgage originations  which are typically retained on the company s balance sheet

the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable inherent loan losses as determined by management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the evaluation by management is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  industry concentrations  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to operations to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
a review of selected loans based on risk rating and size is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with management assigned accountability for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented by the loan review area  which provides information assisting in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the company will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in the company s geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any loan and lease loss forecasting methodology 
at december   the unallocated reserve included within the allowance for loan losses was as compared to  at december  the company was able to reduce the unallocated reserve as it gained added confidence in its forecasting methodology 
the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant  resulting in improved allocation of specific reserves 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation by management is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 

table of contents the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
management believes it has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
during the third quarter of  management refined the process that it uses to perform this analysis 
these included expanded data analysis  improved back testing and continued refinements to documentation surrounding the adequacy of the allowance 
additionally  the controls utilized for data entry  testing  review and approval were enhanced 
these changes provide more reliable measures of the probability of default and risk of loss for the company s categories of loans with similar risk characteristics 
the principal change involves the ability to analyze loss data over a longer period of time 
this improves the measure of inherent loss over a complete economic cycle and reduces the impact for qualitative adjustments 
these changes do not impact losses estimated in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and overall did not have a material effect on the balance of the allowance for loan losses in or the company continues to enhance its loan portfolio monitoring system to enhance its risk management capabilities 
in  the company implemented the markov migration model for its commercial portfolio

the company and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices

liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings and to protect the company against interest rate volatility 
the company continuously monitors its current and prospective business activity in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
the company s primary sources of short term asset liquidity include federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions and securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term asset liquidity is provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and the need to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under the company s asset liability management program 
when these sources are not adequate  the company may use federal fund purchases  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  sale of investment securities or utilize its borrowing capacity with fhlb indianapolis as alternative sources of liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the interest rate risk management program for the company is comprised of several components 
the components include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
it is the objective of the company s interest rate risk management processes to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and capital 
the company manages interest rate risk through the corporate asset and liability committee corporate alco with oversight through the alco and finance committee of the board of directors board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
the corporate alco meets at least monthly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
the company uses the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
management considers ear to be its best measure for managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company uses a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
these interest rate scenarios are executed against a balance sheet utilizing projected growth and composition 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolio 
this simulation model projects the net interest income forecasted under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   the company would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the company would experience a negative change in net interest income 
both simulation results are within the policy limits established by the board alco 
the change in market rates from to and a reduction in the size of the securities portfolio had a positive impact on the ear measure in the down basis point scenario for relative to the small increase in ear in the up basis point scenario reflects the aging of fixed rate debt transacted as part of the balance sheet restructuring 
much of the negative impact from this aging was negated by securing replacement fixed rate debt in the fourth quarter of for a portion of the maturing debt 
estimated change in ear from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  economic value of equity eve 
management considers eve to be its best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the company uses a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities under each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic 
table of contents value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
for eve calculations  future balance sheet composition is not a factor 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points within a range of plus or minus 
at december   the company would experience a negative change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the company would experience a negative change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
the year to year change in the downward rate scenario is largely the result of the change in market rates from to a reduction in the size of the securities portfolio and changes in prepayment expectations account for the majority of the improvement in the eve risk measure from the previous year in the up basis point scenario 
estimated change in eve from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
