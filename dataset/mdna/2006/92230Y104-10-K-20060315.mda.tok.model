item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share count  head count and unit price data overview the following discussion is based upon our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and percentages in the discussion are rounded to the closest full percentage point and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we design  develop  market and support identity authentication products that reduce the risk of loss from unauthorized transactions by validating a person s identity using a one time password and obtaining a legally enforceable digital signature  if needed  for financial transactions 
our products are used currently in a wide variety of applications including  but not limited to  internet banking  internet brokerage  e commerce applications dealing with web or mobile access and various corporate network access applications 
as evidenced by our current customer base  our products are purchased by companies and  depending on the business application  are distributed to either their employees or their customers 
those customers may be other businesses or  as an example in the case of internet banking  the banks retail customers 
our target market is any business process that uses some form of electronic interface where the owner of that process is at risk if unauthorized users can gain access to its process and either obtain proprietary information or execute transactions that are not authorized 
our products can not only increase the security associated with accessing the business process  thereby reducing the losses from unauthorized access  but also  in many cases  can reduce the cost of the process itself by automating activities that were previously performed manually 
industry growth we believe that  while there are no accurate measurements of the total industry s size  the industry growth rate is increasing and will continue to grow at a significant rate into the foreseeable future 
growth is being driven by new government regulations  growing awareness of the impact of identity theft  and the growth in commerce that is transacted electronically 
the issues driving the growth are global issues and the rate of adoption in each country is a function of that country s culture  the competitive position of businesses operating in those countries  the country s overall economic conditions and the degree to which businesses and consumers within the country use technology 
economic conditions our revenues may vary significantly with changes in the economic conditions in the countries in which we sell products currently 
with our current concentration of revenues in europe and specifically in the banking finance vertical market  significant changes in the economic outlook for the european banking market may have a significant effect on our revenues 
during difficult economic periods  our customers often delay the rollout of existing applications and defer purchase decisions related to the implementation of our product in new applications 
currency fluctuations 
in  approximately of our revenue and approximately of our operating expenses were generated incurred outside of the u 
s 
in  approximately of our revenue and approximately of our operating expenses were generated incurred outside of the u 
s 
as a result  changes in currency  especially the euro to us dollar  can have a significant impact on revenue and expenses 
to minimize the net impact of currency on operating earnings  we attempt to denominate an amount of billings in a currency such that it would provide a hedge against the operating expenses being incurred in that currency 
in addition  we also attempt to minimize transaction gains and losses by hedging our net us dollar asset exposure by borrowing us dollars in foreign countries such that assets denominated in us dollars are approximately equal to liabilities denominated in us dollars 
in  the annual average exchange rate for the euro strengthened approximately and the australian dollar strengthened approximately against the us dollar 
the euro strengthened approximately and the australian dollar strengthened approximately against the us dollar in we estimate that the strengthening of the two currencies in compared to resulted in a decrease in revenues of approximately and an increase in operating expenses of approximately while we expect that a strengthening of the euro compared to the u 
s 
dollar would result in an increase in revenue  that was not the case in the decline in revenue in  due to currency  reflects the timing of when revenue was realized and the corresponding changes in currency rates in those periods 
in the fourth quarter of  we realized a significant portion of our revenues when the euro was weaker than the same period in we estimate that the strengthening of the two currencies in compared to resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately  and an increase in operating expenses of approximately  gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange transaction gains aggregating are included in other non operating income expense for foreign exchange transaction losses aggregating are included in other non operating income expense for and gains of are included in other non operating income expense for the financial position and the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
accordingly  assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using current exchange rates as of the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments arising from differences in exchange rates generated a deficit of  in and a surplus and in and are included as a separate component of stockholders equity 
revenue revenues by geographic regions we sell the majority of our products in european countries with significant sales in the u 
s 
and other countries  primarily australia and asia pacific 
the breakdown of revenue in each of our major geographic areas was as follows year europe united states other countries total total revenue percent of total compared to overview and geographic breakdown total revenues in increased  or over the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of digipass units sold and the acquisition of aos hagenuk aos  partially offset by a decline in the average sales price per unit 
revenues from aos were  in  net of purchase price amortization costs of excluding revenue from aos  consolidated revenue increased  or from in  we sold approximately  digipass products  an increase of approximately  units  or  over the  digipass products sold in we believe that the increase in digipass volume is attributable to the growth in our distribution channel  increased investment in sales staff and marketing programs  increased awareness of the need for strong authentication to combat identity theft and our ability to deploy large volumes of high quality products at an affordable price 
our strategy of being the high volume  high quality  low cost producer allows us to compete effectively in both of our primary target markets  banking finance banking and corporate network access cna 
in  we believe that our unit volume increased in large part due to our banking customers desire and need to provide two factor authentication to its internet banking customers 
we expect to see continued worldwide expansion in authentication for consumer related applications and believe that we are well positioned to compete for that business as the market expands 
the average price per unit in was and was lower than the average price per unit in the decline in average price per unit reflects our strategy of providing volume purchase discounts to customers that place firm purchase orders for large volume deployments and a change in mix of our business 
we believe that the lower average prices are a critical element in our customers decision to deploy our technology to their consumer level customers 
in  while each of our markets grew  the growth in large volume deployments exceeded our growth in our lower volume  higher priced markets  such as corporate banking and cna 
as noted in the table above  revenues from each of our geographic regions increased 
both the absolute amount of revenue from each region and the growth over the prior year reflect  in general  the regulatory environment of the region and the customers attitudes towards and acceptance of two factor authentication 
the growth in europe   or over  was attributable to several factors including  but not limited to  the acquisition of aos  the maturity of our sales and distribution channels  increased investment in sales staff and marketing programs and the rollout of the new smart card standard by europay  mastercard  visa emv 
the growth in the u 
s  or  was a result of increased investment in our sales staff and marketing programs 
the growth in other countries   or  reflects the growth in the asia and central south american markets 
the growth in other countries was not only attributable to increased investment in our sales staff and marketing programs  but also to changes in regulations 
in  new regulations were enacted in hong kong 
under the new regulation  each bank that offered internet banking services was required to provide some form of two factor authentication to its customers 
compared to overview and geographic breakdown total revenues in increased  or over the increase was attributable to an increase in both the number of digipass units sold and an increase in the average sales price per unit 
in  we sold approximately  digipass products  an increase of approximately units  or  over the  digipass products sold in the average price per unit in was  which was higher than the average price per unit in the increase in units is primarily attributable to our investment in sales and marketing activities in the average sales price increased primarily as a result of broadening our customer base 
as a result of adding approximately  new customers in and combined  the average sales price increased as our dependence on a few major customers decreased 
the new customers added in were ordering smaller quantities at higher average prices as compared to the existing major customers 
revenues by target market revenues are generated currently from two primary markets  banking and cna through the use of both direct and indirect sales channels 
the breakdown of revenue between the two primary markets is as follows year banking cna total total revenue percent of total revenues from the banking market increased  or in over and revenues from the cna market increased  or in the same period 
the increase in revenues in both markets is attributable  in part  to the development of the indirect sales channel  which includes distributors  resellers  and solution partners 
the number of distributors increased to at the end of from at the end of the indirect sales channel supplements the company s direct sales force in the banking market and is the primary source of revenues in the cna market 
revenues generated by aos in are included in the banking market 
revenues from the banking market increased  or in over and revenues from the cna market increased or in the same period 
the increase in revenues in both markets is attributable  in large part  to the aforementioned indirect sales channel 
the amounts shown above for cna currently include revenues generated in the e commerce market 
we expect that the e commerce market will be an important source of future revenue for the company as our products will not only provide a higher level of security for purchases made over the internet  they can also help protect our customers revenue stream by making it more difficult for subscribers to our customers internet services to share passwords 
gross profit and operating expenses the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and percentage of revenue year ended december  a revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating costs sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring expenses recoveries amortization of purchased intangible assets operating income from continuing operations interest income expense other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income from continuing operations a excludes results of discontinued operations 
see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding discontinued operations 
gross profit compared to consolidated gross profit for was  an increase of  or  from the  reported for gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in  as compared to in the decrease in the gross profit as a percentage of revenue reflects the decline in average sales price per unit related to the increase in the average size of orders received partially offset by a decline in the average manufacturing cost of our product 
the significant increase in the digipass products sold in over reflected larger customer deployments in the banking market  the results of which were reflected in an increase in the average quantity ordered and a decrease in the average sales price per unit 
in  the average quarterly order size for the banking market increased  from approximately units to units per shipment  and the average selling price per unit decreased  from approximately per unit to per unit 
we expect the banking market to continue large deployments to its consumer internet banking customers and  as a result  we expect that we will see additional pressure on the average selling price in during  we also saw an increase in the average order size and a corresponding decrease in average selling price for customers in our cna segment 
the average selling price per digipass product declined approximately to per unit in as compared to the average manufacturing cost per digipass unit sold declined from approximately to  or  in as compared to the decline in the average cost per unit reflected a reduction in the manufacturing cost of almost all units as well as a change in mix of specific products sold 
our purchases of inventory are denominated in us dollars 
also  as previously noted  the company denominates a portion of its sales in euros in an effort to offset the effects of currency fluctuations on operating expenses 
the decrease in revenue resulting from changes in currency rates of  as noted above  along with our cost of goods sold being denominated in us dollars resulted in a decrease in the gross profit rate of approximately percentage points 
compared to consolidated gross profit for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  from  reported the year ended december  gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in  as compared to in the increase in the gross profit as a percentage of revenue reflects the change in mix of orders within the banking market  the reduction in the average cost of each digipass unit sold and the beneficial impact of currency 
the change in mix within the banking market reflected the impact of new customers added in and and resulted in a reduction in the average quantity ordered and an increase in the average sales price per unit 
in  the average quarterly order size for the banking market decreased  from approximately units to units  and the average selling price per unit increased  from approximately per unit to per unit 
new banking customers generally order smaller quantities at the beginning of the relationship as they implement pilot programs and  later  increase their orders as they roll the program out to their broader customer base 
orders for smaller quantities have higher sales prices and higher gross margins 
the average manufacturing cost per digipass unit sold declined approximately in as compared to the decline in the average cost per unit reflected a reduction in the manufacturing cost of most all units as well as a change in mix of specific products sold 
our purchases of inventory are denominated in us dollars 
also  as previously noted  we also denominates a portion of its sales in euros in order to offset the effects of currency on operating expenses 
as the euro and australian dollars strengthened during the year  revenues from sales made in euros and australian dollars increased  as measured in us dollars  without the corresponding increase in cost of goods sold 
the benefit from changes in currency rates as noted above was approximately  and represents an improvement in the gross profit rate of approximately percentage points 
sales and marketing expenses compared to consolidated sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  from the  reported for expenses in included approximately of expense related to aos

on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  net realizable value of inventory  investments in secured services  inc and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements

the per unit prices for large volume transactions are generally lower than transactions for smaller quantities and the price differences are commonly referred to as volume purchase discounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for goods and services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is based on a specific review of all significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
net realizable value of inventory we maintain reserves for inventory where it appears that the carrying cost of the inventory may not be recovered through subsequent sale of the inventory 
we analyze the quantity of inventory on hand  the quantity sold in the past year  the anticipated sales volume in the form of sales to new customers as well as sales to previous customers  the expected sales price and the cost of making the sale when evaluating the valuation of our inventory 
if the sales volume or sales price of a specific model declines significantly  additional writedowns may be required 
valuation of investment in secured services  inc the initial value of consideration received from secured services  inc ssi  in exchange for the assets of the vacman enterprise business unit  was established based on a detailed valuation analysis 
on an ongoing basis  we review information made available by ssi through its filings with the sec and its press releases and consider it within the context of the assumptions made in the valuation analysis 
we also monitor ssi s compliance with the terms of the specific investment instruments to which they relate 
considering the start up nature of ssi  the highly competitive environment in which they operate and the uncertainty associated with ssi s access to additional capital  it may be that ssi s business prospects will deteriorate and  as a result  require us to reduce the value of our investment in ssi 
the investment in ssi as of december  was  consisting of remaining on the note receivable and for the preferred shares  common shares and dividend receivable 
ssi has made its note payment in january  but has not made its note payments in february or march we have granted ssi a day extension on the note in order to facilitate their planned capital raise

we hold a security interest in the software sold to ssi under the terms of the installment note 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets and software development costs we assess the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we assess the recoverability of its purchased software against estimated future revenue for the individual products over the estimated remaining economic life of the software 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
given the highly competitive environment and frequency of technological changes in our industry  it is reasonably possible that estimates of anticipated future revenue  the remaining economic life of our software products  or both may be reduced significantly 
the total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  was  and the full amount is at risk of impairment 
see footnotes and to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
research and development we are devoting substantial capital and other resources to enhance our existing security products and develop new products to provide identity authentication security solutions on different platforms and for different applications 
costs of research and development  principally the design and development of hardware and software prior to the determination of technological feasibility  are expensed as incurred on a project by project basis 
our software capitalization policy currently defines technological feasibility as a functioning beta test prototype with confirmed manufacturability a working model  within a reasonably predictable range of costs 
additional criteria include receptive customers  or potential customers  as evidenced by interest expressed in a beta test prototype  at some suggested selling price

this statement is a revision of sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
the sec issued guidance on april  announcing that public companies will now be required to adopt sfas r by their first fiscal year beginning after june  accordingly  we will adopt sfas r in our first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
it is  however  expected to have a negative effect on consolidated net income  comparable to the pro forma amounts for prior years shown in footnote item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in thousands foreign currency exchange risk in  approximately of our business was conducted outside the united states  primarily in europe and asia pacific 
a significant portion of our business operations is transacted in foreign currencies 
as a result  we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
we are affected by both foreign currency translation and transaction adjustments 
translation adjustments result from the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets and income statements to us dollars at year end exchange rates and weighted average exchange rates  respectively 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded directly into stockholders equity 
transaction adjustments result from currency exchange movements when a foreign subsidiary transacts business in a currency that differs from its local currency 
these adjustments are recorded as gains or losses in our statements of operations 
our foreign subsidiaries business transactions are spread across numerous countries and currencies 
this geographic diversity reduces the risk to our operating results 
interest rate risk we have minimal interest rate risk 
our outstanding debt at december  was  and was at fixed interest rates and our cash is invested in short term instruments at current market rates 
if rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  the company s interest income would increase or decrease approximately annually 
impairment risk at december   we had goodwill of  and other intangible assets of  related mostly to the acquisition of aos in and to technology purchased in as part of our acquisition of identikey 
we will assess the net realizable value of the goodwill and other intangible assets on a regular basis  but at least annually  to determine if we have incurred any declines in the value of our capital investment 
while we did not experience impairment during the year ended december   we may incur impairment charges in future periods
